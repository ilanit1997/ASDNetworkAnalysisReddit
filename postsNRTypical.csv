14,depression,2023-05-27 07:48:44,Due-Violinist5278,I'm struggling. I lost the love of my life Monday night. The grief is physical pain. I made her a video to try n keep busy. Pls watch n share. Every view means her smile is on one more screen. And I'm keeping her memory alive. Thanks,"We met @ school w about 350 ppl in an auditorium. I had seen her speak and It was love at first sight. She was brilliant and beautiful and nerdy, and sarcastic, and spunky. 
I got the courage together to walk up to the podium without permission in front of 350 ppl . And I went to the mic and said. ""My names John and I'm madly in love with Victoria Vaughn! Will u go out w me""? The whole place went nuts. I got in trouble and she got embaressed. We were together after that.  Lol we both had issues w addiction. We ended up dating for 3 yrz. 

We got sober together, baptized together, and then we got engaged. We had a little tiny 1 bedroom apartment on the ocean in north Florida. And they were the greatest memories of my life. Times were simple. And no one existed on the planet except her and I. We prayed together everyday. And there was a buzz about us, because we kind of knew if we stayed sober, what an incredible team we would make.

 She was straight a, very driven and positive person. One of the hardest workers I had ever met.. AND THE ONLY WOMAN MY MOTHER AND DAUGHTER EVER APPROVVED OF...But we relapsed and fell apart. And she ended up moving to Virginia to get away from the drugs and finally b ful time mother to her son. I respected her for that. The plan was, we both get it together, and someday, we find eachother again.

 Unbeknownst to us. She had picked up drinking. And after only 4 yrs. She got cirocis of the liver. When she got ill I was luckily sober and begged to b by her side. I texted her and called her everyday. She refused to let me see her in that state. We were expecting  a liver transfer and a long road to recovery. But she passed away on Monday night due to an anuerism and then no brain function. 

I made this video to deal w the trauma n grief of being sober and never in 36 yrs feeling this way about a loss. But man am I grateful for the ability. I've lost my father, my little sister, my 2 very best friends, my boss, and my ex gf, and now my ex fiance, all to this disease. Which is why I started the reddit grp
 r/sobrietynothercoolsht in the first place. 

Here is a video I made to try and express how much I loved her. I sang it to her all the time and I changed out the chorus from ""euphoria"" to her name ""victoria"" it always made her smile. Let this b a message. This disease of addiction is running us down, no matter our condition and its slaughtering us. We have a better chance of surviving war, than we do a disease of the mind that perpetuates fear and uncertainty and emotio instability. If u r surviving today. You are a physical tangible, piece of evidence that god exists. And I am here for each and every single one that reads this msg. Dm me anytime. Because there is someone out there that feels this same way about you. Love u guys.

15,depression,2023-05-27 08:18:06,jitsupigg,When it rains it pours.,"Lately, as in the last couple of weeks, I’ve (M 35) been really depressed and the thought of ending my life has been on the forefront of my mind. I don’t want to workout anymore. I barely want to eat. I feel my family would be much better off if I were dead. 

It’s starting to effect my judgement. Last week at work, I did something, that at the time I felt was innocuous, but I’ve always known to be stupid. Yet, I did it anyway. The wrong person saw. I got written up. And if there is any further fallout from this I will likely lose my job. Now, my coworkers are seemingly ostracizing me and won’t communicate with me. 

I already feel that I am failing as a man. I feel I am failing as a husband. Worst of all, I am failing as a father. If I lose my job I won’t be able to provide for my family. We are stretched thin as it is. My 1 yo is constantly getting sick and we’re going in and out of the hospital/Dr office. My 2 yo seemingly actively hates me and wants nothing to do with me. And to top it all off, the 25th of May, is the anniversary of my best friends suicide.

24,depression,2023-05-27 06:25:11,OrganizedErraticism,My Disposition,"Not necessarily looking for a diagnosis as much as I am to vent-however, thoughts on what I may be experiencing are welcome.
Notes/behaviors:
1. For some time I’ve been someone who becomes completely captivated by a particular thing and obsesses over it until suddenly I become disinterested. Looking back on it it’s unfortunate because there have been a lot of things if I had never stopped pursuing could have a future in. I learn the things I envelop myself in fairly quickly and it’s almost like my brain hits a threshold of satisfaction prompting me to want nothing to do with said thing anymore. Throughout the years I’ve spent copious amounts of money/time into things I’ve never fully pursued.
2. I’ve noticed unwise purchasing decisions, mostly recently. I think this could be because I never had much to spend before recently. One of my things I picked up was trading card collecting, I’ve spent a few thousand dollars on trading cards and when I get them in I never feel satisfied, I feel like I’m supposed to feel something else-yet, I keep buying them. I lost $600 sports betting today on bets I really wasn’t educated on, and lost $3k last week, thankfully gambling is something I had just picked up and am leaving behind. I amass money and it feels like I need to get rid of it, and so I spend and then I feel awful and anxious about my financial security, why?
3. Repeating actions to try and feel satisfied. Recently I’ve been noticing that I’ve been repeating actions such as pushing my hair back, biting my nails, picking up and putting something down until it “feels right”, but it never feels right and it becomes a monotonous cycle that affects my job/life and the more I think about it the more uncomfortable it makes me.
4. Obsessing over things that could be “wrong” with me. I once spent 7 hours researching literature on schizoaffective disorder because I noticed one or two things that I seem to have related to and thought it must be what’s wrong with me. This extends to practically anything ex. Spot on skin (skin cancer), and in that moment it really feels like I have it and I believe it, I always eventually become rational and realize I don’t but when I get caught up in this catastrophic type mentality it becomes debilitating. Believing that something catastrophic is wrong with me or a loved one creates a subconscious perception that the rest of my life is meaningless.
5. Alcoholism- I just completed my graduate degree and looking back on my last few years in college I can’t put together more than a three day consecutive span where I was completely sober. This scares me and I tell myself drinking every other day or every two days is okay-but it’s not. 
6. Purpose/The future- I have two degrees, the latter of which I finished first in my class. I’ve had some great job opportunities but for some reason am settling for mediocrity. I’ve even had a few Professor go out of there way to have people in my industry interview me- all of which I missed or never contacted back and the shame I would feel after blowing these opportunities is immense, but yet I keep doing it. Now I need a good job, the clock is ticking, and I don’t have one. I often think about what the point is or why I’m here and the lack of a fulfilling answer cripples me.",0,2,2,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13szy9w')>,/r/depression/comments/13szy9w/my_disposition/,False

I get heavy anxity attack when trying to chat with my close friend who I met online since long time ( I used to chat with her daily but this issue didn't exist). I notice this issue comes when I chat particularly girls but not all of them. Although I don't feel worried while texting. 

Yet there are physical symptoms as muscle aches, chest tightness and brainfog and sometimes full collapse by simply sending a message or reading the messages in the chat window. They persist for sometime..

I noticed similar issue starting since 2021, when I studdenly started getting this feeling with some girls i chat with online. But wasn't noticed much and fine most of the time. Now it is getting worse, the whole chat is very friendly.

Based on my search it seems something related to hyperstimulation anxiety that could be linked to such event.

On real life I don't feel such symptoms although I sometimes feel nervous when chatting to a girl but I really do it and don't care at all and no symptoms.

I used to have general anxiety and social anxiety before but I used to expose myself to the event and it would ease as I challenge it and feel awesome later. But this situation doesn't look similar even with the symptoms.

35,Anxiety,2023-05-27 07:35:05,CoolerPenguin78,Another set back,"Had another set back tonight. I’m once again awake at 8am becaus of insomnia. I went to bed at 12am and woke up at 3am and couldn’t get back to sleep. Finally went back to bed and had heart palpitations that made me jump out of bed. This is probably my fourth or fifth set back in the last two weeks. 

I’ve been doing really well with recovery and keep getting set backs. I know this is another one and I’ll overcome it when I eventually get some sleep. 

Just want to post this to encourage people to keep pushing when facing set backs. I’ve had many set backs and overcame them all. It’s getting easier every time too. I’m now just in bed waiting to fall asleep while writing this. I still feel anxious at the minute but that’s all that it is. 

I’ve overcome severe anxiety multiple times in 19 years of life and it comes back every few years. I had it again a few weeks ago and now I’m seeing the light again. Take it from someone that has beaten anxiety multiple times. It does get easier with time and patience. You just have to believe it will. Set backs will happen and they will be disheartening but as long as you don’t let the set backs become failures then you will be fine. Keep fighting.

36,Anxiety,2023-05-27 07:27:40,Caitm8911,Feeling ignored. (This is may have gone on a tangent),"For the past 2 years, I've been talking to my dad about getting my drivers license. He promised he would take me to do a G1 test as soon as I was able to. The day came where I was able to and he initially said that I couldn't do my drivers test unless my brother did too (for context, my brother has said his whole life that he doesn't want to get his drivers license). After arguing with him and talking with my brother, he suddenly moved to the topic of how I'm missing school too often, so he won't take me to do my G1, until I start showing up to school. He's been saying this since November 2022 and its extremely irritating and kind of makes me feel like I'm being ignored. 

I have an anxiety disorder and I have a really difficult time with leaving the house. I've always been like this and he's never understood, but now that I have a diagnosis and I'm more open about how I'm feeling, I was hoping he'd be more understanding. My anxiety has gotten bad recently and I haven't been showing up to school at all. I've been asking if he could at least take me to go drive, as I haven't driven in months (winter roads are not great). He says he'll take me once I show up to school. What I don't think he's grasping is the fact that I am not choosing to stay home. Like I guess I am, but it's not like I wake up and think ""school sucks I'm not going today"". Its more of me panicking the second I wake up. The other morning I literally started sobbing when asking my dad to let me stay home. Despite his knowledge of how horrible I've been feeling, he still insists he won't do anything for me until I go to school. I think he believes that it'll motivate me, but it's really making me feel ignored. 

I just wish he'd take me and my mental health seriously, instead of telling me I'm just ""irresponsible"" and ""lazy"". 

It's frustrating when someone who's supposed to support you, is brushing you off. I've had countless discussions about my mental health with him, last year my dad literally watched me have panic attacks multiple times a day, and it feels like he still doesn't get what I am dealing with. I don't expect him to fully understand, but I want him to at least try and empathize.

I feel the need to tell someone about this, but I don't want to irritate my friend. I plan on bringing it up to my dad, I'm just worried I'm going to end up crying in front of him or something. Which I guess it's okay, but it's not something my family really does.

Peggy - Adult (Tortoiseshell) 5 Years, Female, Spayed, Missing Back Leg

Our two cats have recently started fighting/playing like this whenever Cookie is zoomy. Is it an actual fight or rough play? More importantly should I intervene or not?

Background: We got Cookie about 5 months ago and tried to introduce them slowly, with some mixed results. Cookie spent a while chasing Peggy lots at 3 months but had calmed down for a bit and was mostly leaving her alone. They mostly use different parts of the house. Peggy mostly finds a quiet spot and sleeps, whereas Cookie sits with us and demands play and affection. This level of interaction is fairly new, previously cookie would chase a little and Peggy would find a high spot (like a chair) and swat him away, but the hissing is now a lot more aggressive and Peggy seems to be fighting back more too.

46,cats,2023-05-27 08:06:14,MildlyAnxiousRaccoon,How cautiously optimistic should we be? Possible lymphoma or bacterial infection? Enlarged spleen.,"Hello,

We have had an eventful week. Our sweet 8 year old girl suddenly started experiencing vomiting and diarrhea and was extremely lethargic. 4-5 hours after she first vomited and wasn’t getting any better, we took her the emergency animal hospital. 

They did blood work and imaging and she had elevated white blood cell count as well as an enlarged spleen (2.5cm). The vet suspected either lymphoma (worst case scenario) or a nasty bacterial infection (best case scenario). She had lost about 1.3 lbs since her check up in January (although we did move states in that time and also moved to a place with much more space). They gave her an antibiotic injection and tablets as well as fluids and they took a fine needle aspirate sample of her spleen to be tested. Originally they told us 24-48 hours for results to come back. Today they told us there was an issue and the slides couldn’t be read digitally so they needed to manually mail the samples to the lab and results won’t be available for 7-10 business days. (Kind of scary since untreated lymphoma can take a cat in a matter of weeks and we will be spending two of those weeks waiting for cytosis results.)

After we got home from the vet, our baby got worse. She could barely lift her head, stopped purring, and couldn’t eat or drink anything. But around 12 hours after her antibiotic injection she started moving around a little more and at 24 hours she was almost back to her normal self. At 48 hours, she is still a bit weak but she’s trotting around, responding to her name, purring, grooming, using the litter box, chirping, and eating/drinking well (all things she couldn’t do before). 

We’re driving ourselves crazy waiting for the cytology results which won’t be in for another week and a half. 

We’re being hopeful that it really was just an infection and she’s recovering. I can’t imagine the antibiotics would be making her feel better if it was cancer? But I’m still worried that maybe it’s just a momentary improvement and she’ll go downhill again. 

The severity of the bacterial infection if that’s what it truly was is very alarming. She went from totally fine to not being able to lift her head within ~8 hours. We have no idea how she could have contracted it. She’s indoor only. Any advice on how to prevent reinfection? 

We have completely replaced her litter and litter box and bought a new water fountain. I’m washing all her bedding in hot, soapy water and we washed all her food bowls. Any other precautions you would recommend? 

Any experience or advice would be helpful, we’re going crazy waiting for her results!",1,1,1,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13t1l6p')>,/r/cats/comments/13t1l6p/how_cautiously_optimistic_should_we_be_possible/,False

We've been in a relationship since 5 years. He used to wait for my calls. He used to melt over my kisses. He used to take care of me whenever i fell sick. We were so good to each other. I'll admit that i wasn't immediately in love but now I'm so dedicated towards him.

Now i feel devastated everytime he asks me ""what have i ever done for him"". I used to take care of him too but it was appreciated before but it's just something that he won't even look twice upon. I buy him gifts but he doesn't appreciate. Today i read one of his letters and asked him that you used to be so innocent. And used to write about everything we did and how you loved everything about me. To that he said ""everybody loves chase"" these three words have broken me to my core. I'm not able to talk to him since then. How is it fair? That the love he's getting from me is boring now. It's been six months now and I've been crying to him about it once every month that he has changed. He just shuts me off by saying that we've just matured. 

How my change is filled with love and his change is distance and neglect.

76,AmItheAsshole,2023-05-27 08:00:36,ThrowRAsisteruni,AITA for asking my bf to stop being so generous with his younger sister?,"I've seen a few similar posts on this sub with very mixed reactions, so I'm hoping you guys can help me out here. Me (27m) and my bf (28m) have been together for 6 years. He has a younger sister (19f) who's in her first year of university. My bf has been paying for her living expenses, while we've been renting in a different city. We're not rich by any stretch of the imagination, but this is defo within the bounds of our finances. However I've been arguing for about a year now that we should be cutting down on our expenses to save towards buying a house together. Atm we're renting in a city that's outrageously expensive. IMO we should buy a home just outside the city. I've done some research and mortgage in the town we're thinking of would be waaay cheaper than renting in the city, and the only real difference is we'd have to take a pretty quick train to get to work/into the city.

In theory at least, my bf agrees with this. The problem is that the belt-tightening would also involve sending a lot less money to his sister. To be clear, I'm not talking about cutting her off or anything. She still has her student loan and we'd still be sending her enough money that she can still eat and drink, and go out partying with her friends once or twice a month, as long as she doesn't go too wild. Plus if she gets a job I don't think she'd really feel the difference too badly. But my bf doesn't like this idea. To cut out a lot of irrelevant family drama, he basically got all of his university living totally subsidised by his parents before him and his sister were disowned. He thinks it's unfair for his sister to not be able to have the same uni experience that he had just because his parents are awful. He wants to make sure she doesn't have to work beyond a little Saturday job so she can experience what he experienced.

From my point of view if we cut back on our spending for a couple years or so, then not only would we have a house to our name but we'd also hopefully have more disposable income. We'd probably be able to send more money to her in the long run. A little short term sacrifice for the sake of future gain. Just to be clear, I do care about his sister and want to see her happy. I just think that this is better for everyone in the long run. Like, sure maybe her first couple years might be a little less fun but it's not as if she'll be hard done by. She'll still have all the same support as your average student, and in a couple years in we'll be able to go back to being more generous with our money. Plus the majority of the belt-tightening will be on me and my bf's end. Its not like I'm trying to make his little sister pay for our mortgage lol.

I dunno if I'm just being blockheaded here, but I really can't see what's wrong with my logic. And before anyone asks, yes I'm the autistic one in the relationship lol.

We exchanged greetings and had a brief conversation about school. At one point, she asked me if I could lend her $2, stating that friends should help each other. Despite feeling skeptical, I agreed and handed her $2, hoping she would forget about it.

After the meeting, Alice waited for me at the school gate, reminding me about the money. I only had a $5 bill, which I hadn't intended to give her. Alice insisted that I give her the $5 if I didn't have $2. Fortunately, I managed to find some change and gave her $2.

Following that incident, I tried to avoid Alice as much as possible. Although we occasionally crossed paths and exchanged greetings, I kept my interactions brief.

Two weeks later, during a celebration at the hall, Alice sat beside me and continued to engage me in conversation despite my attempts to disengage. While I was recording my friends' performance, Alice noticed a $50 bill in my bag. She proceeded to tell me about her financial struggles and how she wouldnt have anything to eat, and asking if I could lend her money again. I declined, explaining that the money was my allowance and that I had plans to eat out with my friends. She suggested I buy something during recess and give her $10, even proposing that I deliver food to her house. I was taken aback and didn't respond.

At the end of the celebration, Alice confronted me, expressing her frustration and hunger. She accused me of not caring after hearing her story and choosing to eat out with my friends. I retorted, reminding her that I never agreed to lend her money in the first place and that she hadn't repaid the previous loan. I asserted that I wasn't a charity service and walked away with my friends, while Alice continued to yell at me.

A couple of months ago one of my children (9) really got in to baking. They're doing an awesome job baking cakes, cupcakes, pies, bread, cookies,... and spending a lot of time/taking great pride in decorating them. 

Now, our family has caught wind of her passion and we have all been stimulating her dream to become a worldclass pattisier. She has been recieving ""orders"" and even when she doesn't she'll try and bake something for whoever we're seeing that day. 

Fast forward to today. We have an elderly couple in the family and she decided she was going to try cookies. As the husband of the couple is a diabetic she decided to try her hand at a sugarfree recipe so he could eat some as well. 

She spends a lot of time researching recipes, baking and decorating said cookies and when the elderly couple arrives she proudly shows off her plate and says ""look, these are sugarfree so you can have some too!""

The man looks at her like she asked him to eat fried dogshit and tells her, quite angrily but without raising his voice that she doesn't get to police what he eats and that if she wants to be a baker she'll need to ""actually get good"". 

I watched all enjoyment and pride drain from her face and her eyes teared up. Already fuming i'm walking up to my child when the man rolls his eyes, calls her ""a little baby"" and tells her that she'll also have to learn how to take critisism. 

*Now, from a parenting pov I know I fucked up, this is no example to set.* 

I absolutely lost my shit. I yelled (full on yelled) that he was to leave my house and that he wouldn't be getting the cookies even if he promised to choke on them. When he refused to leave I grabbed his arm and removed him from my house, while using some colorful language and promising he wouldn't be allowed near any part of my family ever again. They ended up leaving, leaving my child gutted and wondering what she did wrong. 

I've spent the last hour consoling her and making sure she realises she did absolutely nothing wrong and that she doesn't lose her passion for baking over this. Now messages and phonecalls are coming in, telling me I overreacted, to the extent that I am starting to wonder if I actually did.

I live in a row of houses, and two of these houses have pet cats. The cats are outdoor cats and I see them around the street. Occasionally one comes into our garden. I’m not home a lot so I don’t know how often or what it does in my garden. 

I recently started redoing my garden and making it pretty. I put out two plant pots of white lilies because it’s my favourite flower. However after seeing a post here I remembered that lilies are highly toxic to cats, and I started worrying about accidentally killing my neighbour’s cats. I didn’t plant these intentionally to hurt any cats; I don’t care if they come in my garden or not because I enjoy seeing animals. 
I know I’m catastrophising (pun not intended but welcome), but would I be TA if my neighbour’s cats died from my lilies? I don’t own any cats so it literally didn’t cross my mind when I planted them.

A small but related note is that I love feeding the wild birds and often have many in my garden. Could it make it look more asshole-y if it looks like I planted them on purpose to hurt the cats, given their (cats in general, not these specific ones) reputation for killing birds?

85,AmItheAsshole,2023-05-27 07:33:15,Several_Drawer340,AITA for not waiting for my husband before recovering my stolen car?,"tl;dr I drove my stolen car home without waiting for my husband or the cops. Now my husband is pissed at me for not considering him and being reckless.

(Note: This post is NOT “Am I the Idiot” for not waiting for the COPS before recovering my car. That has already been established in vivo.)

6 days ago, my car was stolen. Today, my friend and I found my car in the parking lot of our local mall. It was a  total fluke. 

I am irrationally attached to this car. I’ve owned and maintained for 11 years, including paying for a pricy head gasket job recently. I want to pass it to my daughter when she learns to drive. 

When we saw my car today, I started freaking out. I called the police and was put on hold. We waved down a mall security guard, he said to wait for the cops. I got through with the police and they said they were sending someone.

The mall guard told us the cops usually take an hour or more to show up for stolen cars, which checks out since our police force is notoriously understaffed and overburdened. Then mall guy told us that he needed to keep patrolling, and he left.

So there my friend and I were, alone with my car, wondering if the thief would come back before the cops showed up. They had made some bumpersticker adjustments and left a few backpacks inside, so our guess was that it wasn’t just abandoned. The ignition looked normal. I had the key. 

While fairly nauseous with excitement and fear, I called my husband to tell him we found it. He said he would be there soon. Then my friend suggested we try the key, and if it worked, we take the car before the thief came back. I gave them the key and sure enough, the car started. I jumped in and drove it home, shaking.

I know it was stupid and dangerous e.g. evidence destruction and drug residues. I was in full blown fight or flight reptile brain mode over an old car because I’m a deeply sentimental hack. Anyway…

My husband calls while I’m en route home and I tell him what’s up. I get home, call the cops, eat the crow and told them I took my car and to come to my house to do the “recovery.”

Remarkably, the cops showed up within half an hour. They took fingerprints, went through the contents of the car (lots of drugs “recovered” from the backpacks), and told me they won’t be able to prosecute the person if they can’t prove they drove my car, which will be tough since I destroyed prints by driving it. Then they leave. 

Meanwhile, my husband is brooding. We get to talking - he’s upset that I didn’t wait for him before leaving the mall and felt I didn’t consider him, and that my reckless behavior scares him on many levels. 

I explained that I wasn’t thinking rationally in my adrenalined out state, that everything happened really fast. I acknowledged it was fucking stupid of me and I made a split decision on the urging of my friend. At least now we don’t have to fret about how we’re going to afford a new car anymore… yay?

I’ve known my husband since 04. We got married in 06. We don’t have children. I never wanted them, and he always said he respected that. We travelled a lot and had a lot of fun. My husband has been my best friend and support through the years. My mother died in 2015 and that was unimaginable, but he was a rock.

Skipping ahead to last year, he out of nowhere sat me down and suggested we try an open relationship. I was thrown off. I thought our sex life was pretty good. His libido is higher than mine, and he initiates more than half the time but there’s nothing I wouldn’t do to please him sexually. 

I was hesitant but eventually agreed to it. We established rules and I started reading up on polyamory. The rules were that he couldn’t have anyone in our bed and he always used protection. I didn’t have rules cause I didn’t plan on seeing anyone else.

You could probably guess by the title that I changed my mind. I joined the apps. I told my husband and he was confused and genuinely curious about what I could want to gain from this. I said I wanted to explore. The books I’d been reading opened my mind to a whole new world. Reluctantly, he gave me permission to see other men with the same rules I gave him: no hosting, protection.

I started noticing how inquisitive he was about what I was doing and who I was seeing. He asked me if I was seeing men repeatedly or just having ons’s. I told him that, while I wasn’t completely comfortable going into detail, I could say that I was seeing someone pretty regularly. He pushed it again and was curious about what we do together. I told him that I’ve been exploring kink with this guy, and it makes me feel empowered.

That was that. Until a few days later when he told me that he thinks we should become exclusive again. Reddit, I’m PISSED. I flat out told him no, that this feels unfair. He said the fact that I’m letting men “tie me up and violate me” bothers him immensely. I assured him everything was safe. He didn’t care.

The last conversation we had, which was this morning, was him giving me an ultimatum that if I go on anymore dates before we sort this out, I can find a divorce lawyer.

87,AmItheAsshole,2023-05-27 07:19:33,YoYowhatsupman123,AITA for wanting a team-mate off our competitive sport team,"Long story short we started playing a team sport (volleyball) initially socially but with intent to play competitively. One of the team members who  I will call John joined our team through another team-mate. 

We play competitive once a week but train three times a week. Training is much more of a social and informal thing as well. 

John only comes on the competitive nights and does not attend the training sessions, whilst the other team members attend the competitive nights and the training sessions.

The team has expressed that they are frustrated with John as he comes every week to the competitions but does not attend training. He is also very new to the sport, not playing much at all previously, and making bad plays and making us lose games and lose points consistently. We do have to pay a fee every week so we feel that we are wasting our money. 

I privately messaged John suggesting he attends the social/training nights only if he does enjoy the sport, as this is more informal and casual instead of the competitive nights. I included in the message that as a team we were a bit frustrated with his performance. John didn’t reply to the message and suddenly stopped showing up to the sport all together, but has been messaging other team-members that he feels like a let down and thus does not want to come anymore. 

I do feel bad in this situation, and it may be because of my competitive nature, but I think it only makes sense to attend the training/social nights if you are only going to play the sport casually. 

What do you guys think?

John has also been going around telling people that he ‘overheard me’ telling other people behind his back that he is a let down when I clearly private messaged him about the situation but he just did not respond, which is now making me look like a bad person.",8,6,6,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13t0unx')>,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13t0unx/aita_for_wanting_a_teammate_off_our_competitive/,False
