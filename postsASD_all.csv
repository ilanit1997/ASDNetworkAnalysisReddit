Kids shows / cartoons are visually “dazzling”, satisfyingly my visual sensory seeking, and the themes/lessons are overtly described to the viewer.

2,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-05-17 12:57:57,luna_bea_tuna,My life is falling apart,"WARNING: This is a vent.

Self diagnosed 6 months ago. Married and have a 3 year old, live far from family (another continent far).

My life has been slowly falling apart. 
- I started anti depressants 2 years ago for depression and anxiety, which has caused weight gain to which I am reacting poorly (I hate how I look and I put a lot of my self worth in appearance). The medication does not help with depression but helped with anxiety, until it didn't. I am going to go off this medication since it's not helping. 
- 2 months ago i left my job/was asked to leave (it was mutual). I'm at 7-8 years of recurring burnout at every job I've had. I can't see a future where I work without burning out once a year, hating and resenting my job and then leaving or quitting. I think about starting a new career but feel hopeless there's anything else I can actually do. I feel so useless.

- my wife and I are constantly fighting and it's the same triggers. In various situations I will get overwhelmed and become nonverbal, and she will push for words or her needs. I try to explain I'm all out of spoons and can't do anything more but she keeps pushing and asking for more or rejecting what I am saying and minimizing my experience. To her point, I get so overwhelmed and then yell or be angry when i communicate, which is totally unfair to her, but I can't stop myself. I get so angry when I'm trying to communicate what's happening and am interrupted and talked over or my experience is minimized. I feel hopeless I can be the partner she needs and that she can be the partner I need. The ASD possibility is still pretty new and I think she would respond better to reading about it versus me explaining myself. Our 3 year old takes all my energy. Constant noise and needs. Makes every stressful situation that I was able to get through in the past impossible. I think outside of burnout I'm a good father and usually enjoy the experience. But it gets to be so much. I don't understand how to do this. I'm failing and there's nothing that can be done.

Health, job, family all on the decline with no light at the end. I can see this is only going to end one way. I'm miserable and I'm making my family miserable.",20,7,7,0.68,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13k10rg')>,,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/13k10rg/my_life_is_falling_apart/,,,False

4,yes,u_luna_bea_tuna,2023-05-08 11:22:42,luna_bea_tuna,Beckmann Street FLX 30-35 - First Impressions,"I was pretty sure this bag wasn't going to work for me (its 1.5kg empty) but I really wanted to at least spend a bit more time trying it out than in the store. I had a look at the Beckmann 26L a few months ago and it felt too heavy and small in capacity (for the bulk/size) so thought maybe the 30-35L would be better. Also, I really like the look of matte black rubberized bags :| 

&#x200B;

My Requirements:

* I would \*like\* to have a bag that usually 20L but can expand to swallow another backpack (my sons + various kid winter or rain gear). I thought maybe a 30L bag would still be small enough for EDC.
* Water repellant (no need for rain cover for a 30min bike commute)
* Less than 1kg
* Water bottle pocket
* One big compartment with a few internal pockets.

&#x200B;

Some of this is copy pasted from my last 'review' of the 26L, but still applies as the bag is very similar. The Beckmann website has pretty good pictures and details of the exterior and internals, but thought I would also give an initial first impression and review and maybe some more details on the size of pockets and typically what you can fit in the bag. I haven't used the bag more than what I've done for this initial review as I don't intend on keeping it.

&#x200B;

Some findings and thoughts (aside from what you find on the website):

* It feels like a good quality bag.
* It stands up on its own (when empty), though it looks like it will fall over. Maybe if loaded in a strange way.
* The lid tends to want to flap in, covering the top opening when unzipped. I could flip it out, but seems to prefer going in. A bit annoying when I wanted to fill the bag. 
* The extra 5L is a wedge shape and...I guess adds 5L volume. I wish the bag were smaller when this was zipped up or bigger when unzipped. But maybe I didn't test packing it well enough.

&#x200B;

* Outside:
   * The bag is big. It's a 30L bag though so that shouldn't be unexpected, and the material is stiff enough that it retains its shape when empty, which I like, but then it means its always big (ish). 
   * The outer materials (soft touch rubberized) feel and looks great.
   * Materials have a 'quality' thickness to them. Like they aren't going to tear any time soon.
   * The zippers slide really smoothly, going from all the open to all the way closed, they didn't snag along the way.
   * The straps all have strap keepers.
   * The back panel is well padded and rigid, from both an internal plastic sheet (i think) and there's a (maybe removable) flat aluminum piece running down the spine I guess for extra laptop protection? Or maybe its a shoe horn for shoe horning on the go.
   * The compression straps have buckles! Should be good for maybe also getting a jacket in there, or even something long that sits in the water bottle pocket. Also, these have strap keepers. Nice.
   * 2 external water bottle pockets, which are on the medium size. My big water bottle fit but it felt like I was overstretching the pocket. For a 'normal' size water bottle, a twisty bike lock, or anything else I just need to shove in there on the go they will do nicely.
   * 2 external pockets, one on the lid, and one on the front. The lid one has a lot of capacity and the front a bit less, but still useful, also a bit trickier to get into.

&#x200B;

* Inside
   * The laptop sleeve is lined with a velvety material. It real nice.
   * On the front there's a hand size mesh zip pocket and a headphone size elastic pocket.
   * There's also 2 mesh 'water bottle' elastic pockets along the insides and a document sleeve
   * The velvety laptop sleeve is big enough for my 16in laptop but the laptop is tall enough that the velcro flap can't engage

&#x200B;

Thoughts

* It's a super nice bag. Good size pockets and placement. But too big for me for EDC. Though that's more of a 'me' problem.
* I really want my next bag to have a light coloured inner liner. With a top loader, it can be really hard to see into the bag and where all the things are.
* My expectation was that the expansion would result in either a much smaller bag when not expanded or a much larger bag when expanded. But it was just a bit more space.
* Was this review helpful? Not sure.

I can't regulate my body temperature and end up too hot or too cold really easily. I am trying to find a backpack that I can quickly store and take out my puffy winter coat or rain coat on the go (bike, outside, inside, bus). 

I'm going in circles on something like the aevor trip pack, which has an expanding rolltop, side waterbottle pocket, and carry straps. BUT I'm unsure of aevor bag quality and I'm obsessing over it being a non flat bottombag that will fall over when I put it on the ground. 

Please let me know if this super specific backpack usecase resonates with you and how you've solved it. 😬

I'm constantly on the lookout for an expandable rolltop style backpack, but that has additional access. I was inspired by this post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacks/comments/114hmlz/20222023\_everydaymultipurposeversatile\_clean/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacks/comments/114hmlz/20222023_everydaymultipurposeversatile_clean/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3))

Most of the bags here were listed in other reddit posts, so thank you to everyone that contributed. And please comment if you have more suggestions :)

Need: EDC backpack that can expand to fit my jacket, or another small child size backpack / kids snow gear.

&#x200B;

Requirements

* Minimal design (few straps, hangie bits, etc)...
* <1.5kg
* 18 - 35L range
* Roll top style backpack with additional access zip or panel
* Laptop compartment (does not need its own external access)
* Max 200 USD / 200 EUR

Bonus:

* External carry straps
* External water bottle pocket
* External secret pocket
* Self standing (but this is really more of a must have. I hate when my backpack falls over, or can't stand up when I'm filling it.)

I have really been struggling with meltdowns every evening. My son is 3 and is super talkative and my partner is also a super talker.  

There are 2 situations that I really struggle with with my family. I'm hoping someone out there has similar experience and found a solution that could maybe help me too.

1) Both my NT partner and son will be talking at me (usually in a small room / confined space that I can't just leave without going through them). I am overwhelmed by too much sound and can't understand either of them, and I meltdown because of the noise stimulus. I TRY to tell them calmy to both stop talking, but it comes out as yell or as short words. I have tried to explain to my partner that at that point my communication energy is gone and any words I use just come out and I need them to understand it is not I am angry, I am just overwhelmed and don't have the energy to 'calm down and ask in a calm manner' in that moment. They interpret the whole exchange as me telling them to ''shut up''. In my mind I am suffering and pleading with them to stop talking, but they see it as me aggressively trying to shut them down and control them. Despite talking about this afterwards, they can't help but see it this way. I feel so guilty now, and trapped, like I can never have my needs met or this part of me understood or accepted, and that I am 'bad' for having this need. Or that we are just a bad match doomed to fail (if we aren't already failing). Or that I'm just not a match for anyone and should really be alone 90% of the time.

She reenacted a hand symbol I try to use (the stop hand symbol) and did it so angrily at me, it felt like I was being mocked. How can I explain how desperate and overwhelmed I am in those situations? It's like I'm drowning and thrashing around in the water. We have decided I will use the ''I love you'' hand symbol instead of trying to talk and hopefully this makes in a difference in the way we both react.

2) In the evenings after pickup from daycare, my son will talk non-stop. I'm realizing that at the end of a workday, I'm probably all out of spoons from work and interacting with others in the world. So, when it comes to bed time and winding down, he will be talkative/noisy and not listening to us, and both the non-stop noise and focused effort push me into a meltdown. My partner's reaction was to say to me 'don't meltdown', when I really wish they would be empathetic and comforting and see I'm in distress. It's like saying ''don't drown'' to someone who's drowning and can't swim.

In general they don't seem to have any empathy for what I'm experiencing. I'm feeling so guilty for the way I react. The whole experience is depressing and the only way I see things changing is to leave (either the marriage/family or this world).",4,0,0,0.5,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='10fxih9')>,,/r/autism/comments/10fxih9/how_to_explain_my_needs_to_my_partner_and_how_do/,,,False

Hello! Last week my wife suggested I may be on the autistic spectrum (based on a discussion with another friend that discovered they are on the spectrum later in life). 

Well, I’ve jumped down the rabbit hole, and taken all the self tests which say I am highly likely on the spectrum. And I feel a strong resonance with what Ive read about asd on Reddit and elsewhere.

I worry I am an imposter and not autistic, and just adjusting my feelings and personality or picking and choosing what makes sense to indicate I’m autistic as a way to explain my past behaviour and feelings, and feel like I finally belong in a group. Or treating it like an excuse for “bad” behaviour, like because I have autism I can’t be expected to not freak out in triggering situations.

I’m wondering if it really matters if I am autistic or not. Though it may matter from an understanding self and “treatment” perspectives. And could also be an explanation for the anxiety and depression, like those are symptoms of unaddressed autism? Or maybe it’s a super fun combination of all 3.

What I haven't been able to do is really take anything I learn in therapy to help myself outside of the 24hr window after therapy.

1. What are your ''tools'' / techniques for working through feelings in the moment?
2. Do you have any physical/visualized objects/techniques to remind yourself? Or if not, how do you remember them? Or jolt yourself out of a moment to remember that you even have tools?

After 4 weeks on 225mg I feel better than I did on 150mg, better at managing social situations and depressive episodes, though it may also be because the high stress period is gone. I saw my doctor finally and she said I should not go above 150mg (effect of the drug is not much higher but side effects would be much higher) and instead prescribed another medication to complement venlafaxin for depression. 

But given that I feel better on 225mg…I kind of want to stay on this dosage for longer and not add another drug. Talking more with her is probably the best move, instead of just not listening and taking 3x75mg and not 150mg + the new medication.

28,yes,Anxiety,2022-07-12 16:51:57,luna_bea_tuna,I can't plan anything by myself,"A bit of background: I'm married and have a 2 year old, and work a 9-5 job. We live abroad away from family so don't really have any help taking care of our son. All that is to say I find my normal responsibilities tend to fill my time and am generally bad about making time for myself, though I do get some hours here and there for hobbies.

  
Last year I started taking medication for anxiety and depression (which in retrospect I have had my entire life. Neat!) and seeing a therapist. I went on sick leave due to ongoing anxiety attacks about a new job, and suffered the usual dreading waking up everyday and seeing no point in life. You know, the usual. Eventually I changed jobs and along with the medication and therapy got past the anxiety.

For the first time in years, I now have a week off to myself (wife and kid are visiting family and I'm on vacation), and I find it impossible to plan something fun to do by myself. Usually I am so overwhelmed being around other people that I keep imagining I will go off on a hiking trip by myself and just get away from everyone. 

But when it comes down to planning a trip, even just a day trip, I get tunnel vision and have trouble focusing and generally feel short of breath and overwhelmed. I'm so uncertain and overwhelmed about where to go, what gear I should buy (and should I even buy gear for a one or two time thing), if I actually want to go on a trip, what I even want to do. And I am so afraid of making the wrong choice, that I just don't choose. And then my whole ''deal'' of wanting to get away from everyone is revealed to be an obtainable fantasy, or just not really what I want. And then the question is what do I want to do with the precious free time I have.

This is pretty typical for me planning ANYTHING, that I either waste my time in indecision, or give up. Generally my wife does all the planning, and I can help her make decisions...but when it comes to myself I'm hopeless.

Maybe it means that I need to plan something with a friend, but for just this once I don't want to have be following what someone else wants to do, or needing to ask for help or borrow gear or...maybe its unrealistic given it's something I've never done before.

He said the idea has also crossed his mind since we met. 

I don't have a BPD diagnosis and none of my healthcare providers have mentioned it to me in my life but then again they didn't catch the autism until I brought it up either. I was curious that so many people were seeing this disorder in me so I did some research into it and it was uncomfortable how relatable it felt. I looked into specifically how autism and BPD can overlap and how they differ and I still relate very much to both. 

I don't really know what I'm looking for. For some reason I thought my autism diagnosis would be the last major psychiatric diagnosis I would receive in my life so I don't think I want to pursue if I would qualify for a formal diagnosis right now. I think I'm just uncomfortable because it feels like every time I finally figure out what's going on with me, there ends up being something else still.

 Does anyone else have experience with this comorbidity? Am I leaping to conclusions here by assuming there's a high chance I have this disorder based on my internet research and observations from others alone? This is how I discovered my autism after all. Is it worth bringing up to my therapist and/or psychiatrist to see what they think? I worry they'll think I'm being dramatic and that I'm looking for something to be wrong with me.

31,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-04-06 19:50:04,Putrid-Occasion1881,how much can coping skills and such improve autism symptoms?,"Autism comes with all sorts of symptoms obviously but generally with certain symptoms like anxiety, sensory difficulties, social struggles and such, there are things that can be done to, not take away, but improve the symptom. For example I can't take away the anxiety but I can learn skills to cope with it and eventually make it easier.  I can't take the sensory overload away but I can practice exposure and other skills to develop a higher tolerance for it. 

I guess my question is how do I determine if a symptom can or should be worked on and how do I know if it's something I can continue to improve or if I've reached the max improvement I can make. Because if I can just continue to improve with it then I would think we could all just therapy our way out of autism but obviously that's not how it works. 

I've had a lot of conversations with people telling me things like ""I know it's a symptom of your autism but it's still not ok and we need to find a way to work on it/change the behavior"". Which of course autistic people are just like others and we have the capacity to hurt feelings even if it's a symptom and we don't mean to. But how much of a change in behavior is reasonable to expect before it becomes ableist? I don't disagree with the conversations for the most part. Usually it's something like I was really overwhelmed but rather than give myself space when i knew I was getting there I blew up at someone. So yeah, reasonable to want a change there I think. 

I'm having difficulty finding the line with what's reasonable to expect from myself and what's not. There have been occasions when looking back I can tell it was ableist but in the moment I just feel ashamed because I take so long to change behaviors. I don't know if this makes much sense.

I've been struggling with it basically since I became sexually active. My partner has helped a lot seeing as he's the only person that has given me the time to explore my likes and dislikes with him but even still, the sensory overwhelm has a really big effect and I can only follow through about once every five or seven times we initiate it. He's super understanding and doesn't ever try to make me feel bad about it but I know he doesn't understand the extent of how it affects me and talking about it can sometimes be difficult and frustrating. 

It's not that I don't want it or anything, I do. It's just that whenever we start I get really overwhelmed and my mind starts focusing on everything else around me. I'm normally really ticklish which is also a major sensory trigger so I'll start anticipating that when his fingers touch me the sensation is too light and then that feeling of overwhelm won't go away and I have to stop things. My previous therapist brought up that there may have been some sort of assault in my childhood which I don't think is a huge stretch to assume because I have a lot of sensitivity around that whole topic.

45,yes,AskVet,2021-10-23 05:51:26,Putrid-Occasion1881,Can repeated exposure to marijuana smoke cause nerve damage in a cat?,"My friend's roommate's cat is a 14 year old overweight tabby cat who lives day and night in the kitchen. He can't go outside because he has severe allergies. Both him and his roommate regularly smoke weed indoors for medical purposes. My friend smokes in his room across the house from the kitchen with the door shut, windows open and makes reasonable efforts to keep the smell from traveling to the rest of the house, which roommate has said works well. The roommate is currently sleeping in the living room for unrelated reasons. He only smokes stiizy pods though the living room connects directly with the kitchen. The kitchen does have a door on it that always remains shut. 

Recently the cat was seen acting very lethargic and later was unable to walk properly. The roommate took the cat to the vet but when he returned he told my friend that the vet had asked him directly if anyone in the house smoked marijuana and then said that the reason for the cat's behavior was that it was being exposed so regularly to weed that it was constantly high and it was causing neurological damage. The cat is receiving treatment and is recovering well and my roommate no longer smokes in the house but my question is more about how a vet would come to this conclusion. Is it possible that it's so obvious weed was causing the issue that the vet felt confident to ask for it specifically? The roommate also said that the vet specified that a stiizy wouldn't be able to cause the damage in the way a bong or dab rig could which would make sense except that the roommate has confirmed themself that the efforts my friend had been putting into masking the smell had been effective and also my friend is across the house and the smoke would have to travel and get through a couple of doors. And yes, while a stiizy isn't nearly as strong, repeated use throughout the entire day still leaves the house smelling just as if you've been smoking from a dab all day and it wouldn't be hard to make it into the kitchen if people are regularly opening the door to go in and out. 

My friend and I are just really confused as to the circumstances of the diagnosis, especially since he's basically receiving all the blame. Also I apologize for the nature of the question, we realize exposing an animal to weed at all isn't ok so I just want to reiterate that the cat is receiving treatment, is recovering well, and weed is no longer being smoked around the cat.",3,1,1,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='qdyx49')>,,/r/AskVet/comments/qdyx49/can_repeated_exposure_to_marijuana_smoke_cause/,,,False

Talking about things with someone does help but I hear people talk about going to therapy and working on how to process certain events or learning coping skills and getting homework that they have to do and I've never felt like I got any of that in therapy. I've been to about 7 or 8 different therapists, most of them for 2+ years but every session was just them asking me how my week was or talking about things they felt were important but even then we never really explore those things for more than that session. I tend to not bring things up unless asked but usually when I'm asked I immediately forget what it was i needed to talk about. I was able to bring that up once but the response i got was ""well if you can't tell me what's bothering you then I can't help you"" which is fair but I had been expecting an answer more along the lines of ""ok let's explore that and see if there's a reason you can't remember"".

I've been out of therapy for a few months now and I know I really need to find a new one sooner than later with covid restrictions being loosened plus, among other things, the fact that I'm moving at some point this year and have no idea how I'm going to handle that.

52,yes,AutisticAdults,2021-04-16 11:03:53,Putrid-Occasion1881,cw: self harm. Just a long rant because I need to talk about things but don't have anyone to do that with,"(CW: self harm for second to last paragraph in case anyone is sensitive to that.) I feel like I just gave up. I've been feeling like real shit lately, just losing hope about the future and my life and lately I've really been wondering why I even try anymore. I'm 21 and I live at home still which I know is not a bad thing at all and is pretty normal but I have to drop out of school because I can't even keep it together for one semester and while I just applied for a job, it was more out of a combination of being desperate to leave and also to prove that I'm not just lazy or worthless and to not be a burden  anymore though realistically I don't think I'm capable of being a reliable employee at all right now.

I know I'm autistic and I have a diagnosis to back it up but in the last few years I came to be pretty comfortable with myself which resulted in a big change of personality from being a very socially impaired teen to being decently outgoing, social, and responsible enough to acquire management positions at a few different fast food places. I know none of that means I'm not autistic however that's exactly what it seems to mean to all of my family that is aware of the diagnosis. My mom keeps asking me if I'm sure it's autism and keeps telling me about the other diagnoses she thinks suit me better. Mostly she says it's just anxiety and that I need to stop holding onto grudges (she's referring to meltdowns I had because she went and completely deep cleaned my room while I was in the mental hospital after she specifically promised she wouldn't touch anything and then waited until an hour before I got home to tell me and then got mad at me for having a meltdown because she spent a lot of time on it and I should be more grateful. The grudge I'm apparently holding is that I don't want her touching anything in my room at all because I can't trust that she's going to do what she tells me she's going to do. Not that it stops her anyway).

I know I'm autistic but I feel like it can't be true if everyone that knows me best is saying I'm wrong. Logically I know that there are a multitude of reasons as to why I'm autistic but there's still a big part of me that thinks that I'm just overreacting and making a huge deal of nothing. I have a diagnosis but even that feels iffy because the psychologist that diagnosed me has no experience with autistic people and couldn't really answer my questions about it beyond basic google type answers that I can and have found myself. He referred me to autism speaks and I stopped seeing him after I told him I struggle with getting myself to do daily tasks which make it really hard to function and he told me that I need to stop thinking that I can't do it and instead to think that I can and if that doesn't work then he can't help me and I need to see a neurologist.  I haven't had success with finding any other psychologist or organization to go to that takes my insurance. I want to get a second opinion just to be sure but my insurance doesn't cover diagnosis at all. I've heard that most don't.

I'm terrified that someone is going to tell me that no, the diagnosis was wrong and/or not valid and that it really all is in my head and I'm just selfish and ungrateful and lazy like my mother says I am. I'm afraid to even say I'm autistic or fill in or click the bubble on forms and stuff because someone is going to catch me in this lie I've come up with. I'm trying to learn more about it and myself but I still have trouble recognizing what my meltdowns even look and feel like let alone what causes them. I read an article that said it's good to explore different ways to stim so I did and I realized that I stim all the time, I just had no idea that's what I was doing. Before I got diagnosed I had begun hand flapping which I hadn't done before but suddenly started to feel necessary when I was especially overwhelmed or upset. Part of what led to me getting diagnosed was that I believe I experienced burnout that resulted in a bit of loss of a few skills. I worry that that paired with the recently more obvious stimming will only serve as more proof to those around me that I'm just making it up. I feel like it was burnout and honestly feel as though I'm still experiencing it 6ish months later but even worse. At the same time I'm still doubting that I'm even autistic and that calling it burnout is just trying to find an excuse for why I'm being lazy or something.

The worst part is that I believe I'm autistic and I'm 100% okay with that, in fact I was relieved at how much it makes sense. If it wasn't for the resistance my family has towards it, I don't think I would be worrying at all or at least nothing close to this. I feel like I just gave up tonight because I self harmed for the first time in years. It's not bad, as not bad as self harming can be anyway. Not bad as in it'll heal in a day or two. But I hate that I've gotten to the point where that feels like the only solution even though I'm well aware that it's anything but a solution. I feel really guilty because my boyfriend has been struggling immensely lately with his own issues and even though he's truly incredible and so so supportive, I hate that this is now just another thing for him to be stressed out about. I know that this doesn't have to mean anything and that just because it happened once doesn't mean it has to happen again and all. But as guilty as I feel, there was a part of me that was relieved because the wound I gave myself is more than anything else I've been able to do to address the level of turmoil I have going on in me right now.

I'm terrified even posting this because I'm scared that everyone here is just going to tell me to get over myself and that I'm being dramatic. If that's the case please at least don't be mean.

Finding out I'm autistic would feel like a huge relief because now I know for sure that there's nothing wrong with me except that pretty much every single person close to me has been very upfront about the fact that they don't believe me.

The chlorine is to bide us time till we get back and start the drain and refill process over the next week (5 inches at a time). Apparently this is rare? Thing is we haven't been able to really use our pool much for the past 2 years because of a mixture of me not wanting (or at times even being able to) afford paying someone to maintain the pool and thus always chasing problems and the pool never being ""quite ready"" when the family wanted to use it. To simply giving up on it and just dumping tons of chlorine in it for the past year every couple of weeks and feeling like a failure. 

I had already planned that going forward we're going to get professional weekly service and make it fun and inviting and always ready. Cost be damned (now that we can afford to make that decision).

74,yes,pools,2023-02-11 01:51:17,MyBrainsPOV,Considering pool upgrades & advice needed / heater / pump / cover / salt,"Hi all! I am considering several upgrades and am hoping to get some feedback and advice. #1 going into all of this is energy efficiency. 

So, we just got electric solar installed and we're starting to see significant savings in our electrical bill so I am really hoping that we can make these upgrades as energy efficient as possible. 

\#1 is upgrading from a single speed pump to a variable speed pump. We just got this pump a little over a year ago so it kind of sucks considering replacing it so soon but if the ROI is there then we'll do it. 

\#2 is adding a heat pump heater. We used to have a solar system we'd pump water through but those came down when we got our new roof and electric solar panels. Currently looking at the HeatWave SuperQuiet SQ225 or SQ150VS

(Bonus question; can you have a variable speed pump with a variable speed heat pump and is there any benefit or negation from combining the two?)

\#3 is adding a solar blanket on a reel. We have one end of the pool where I wouldn't mind losing walking space if the solar blanket reel is worth it. My only real concern is if we have the solar blanket out on the pool and one of my small dogs falls in, would they slip under and drown? 

\#4 and last on the list is converting to salt water. I'm ready to bite the bullet and pay someone to start maintaining my pool for me but I've read some stories that make it sound like if you convert to salt that it's much easier to maintain. Could a person like me who's often chasing my pool's balance and failing find success maintaining his own pool after converting to salt water? Would the reduction in chemicals ultimately make the cost worth while? 

I appreciate any feedback and advice. Thank you so much!",10,3,3,0.81,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='10z95zi')>,,/r/pools/comments/10z95zi/considering_pool_upgrades_advice_needed_heater/,,,False

It's amazing to me that we sometimes have days under 40kw and other days we have nearly 90. We average around 50. We recently had a weekend where we spent less than $1 on power for the entire day. But other days it seems like we're flooding power out of our ears. We want to spend this year finding the energy hogs and replacing them. I have two energy monitors I bought on amazon to install in our breaker box (currently looking for an electrician familiar with the devices and experience installing them, so they are just sitting on a shelf). 

We live in Florida

2019 central air

recently installed a heatpump in far bedroom may expand that this year to other rooms

Homeschool kids, house is almost always occupied. 

Biggest hogs I imagine are electric stove, dishwasher, electric clothes washer and dryer, and obviously AC. Also, we have a house fridge, a garage fridge, and a garage freezer.

I have spent months agonizing over this but after posting here several times with engagement, meeting with a fiduciary, and finally meeting with my CPA to discuss my 2022 and 2023 tax situations I have come to the conclusion that the following is now my plan:

Sell about $200k worth of stock

Put $20k aside for taxes either in an HYSA or CD or I-Bonds (wife and I)

Put $15k aside for an emergency fund (HYSA)

Put $22.5k aside for retirement investing

Put $140k into our house

Recast our mortgage and end up with around a $400 mortgage payment

Then the plan is to put all extra money into a taxable investment index fund account and sell stock in the next opportunity to put towards house (hopefully paying it off entirely within the next 2 years). 

Once our mortgage is in this position ($400 a month) we'll be putting all available cash into investments.

I am currently in a private company purchase offer that's got 2 weeks left so that I can sell off company stock. I have about 350k in stock and about 243k of it is vested.

1. 3 months emergency fund at least (sell $15,000 worth)
2. 15% towards retirement (my wife just turned 50 so $7k to my wife's IRA (SAH Mom) and balance to my Roth 401k (no match) (sell  $11,250 worth total). 
3. $40,000 to my house principal. After 40k the interest savings tapers off (which means if I were to put $60k towards it I'd only pay off I'd only pay off about $55k in interest and it goes down from there in a curve)
4. We are considering also selling enough to pay our mortgage for the rest of the year.

Question #2 is if we keep it until he's ready; how does growth work when we put it into a HYSA or CD or mutual funds etc? (he'd keep the interest not us). 

Seems like its less complicated if we gift it to him via 4 checks from my wife and myself in 2022 and 2023 and he just takes our advice on how to invest it but there's also concern of him spending it. It's a concern he is fully aware of and he wants us to help him. There is 100% transparency on everything. 

My current thought is to split the money between a HYSA and a 5 year CD. It looks like he could make between 8-11k if he left the money alone for 5 years that way.

Any help is appreciated. Thanks!",135,202,202,0.88,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='z4kjc5')>,,/r/personalfinance/comments/z4kjc5/giving_50k_to_my_brother_whats_the_best_way_to_do/,,,False

94,yes,HomeImprovement,2022-11-02 00:38:10,MyBrainsPOV,"New metal roof. Do I keep the ""left overs"" for future repairs?","I just got a new metal roof installed. About $34k. Today the project rep reached out to me and wanted to know if I wanted to keep the leftover metal panels. It's 26g charcoal colored standing seam panels. There are 8 left over, over 22 feet long each. I have a quarter acre lot, no barn; basically I have no idea where I'd put these. But it feels wasteful and I wonder if I'll regret it later if I take him up on his offer to cut them up for the dumpster. My question is essentially how expensive might this decision be down the road if I say ""get rid of it"". That's where I'm at realistically because where do I store that kind of material for years and years on a quarter acre lot? I dont want to look like a junk yard. 

&#x200B;

But on the other hand what if we get a crazy hail storm in 2 years and they no longer make my exact shade or style of panel? I'm hoping some of you have some real world experience that can help us make this decision. I've played with the idea of laying them down along one side of fence and building a sitting bench over and around them but truth be told that's a further waste of money and no one wants to sit against a fence in Florida (lizards, bugs, squirrels, etc). Maybe I can somehow get them into my attic and that wouldnt be so bad. But is it worth it? And if I did that and need a repair in 5 years and my attic stored panels are like brand new and my roof panels have 5 years of weather and sun will that be any better than mismatched panels bought down the road?",123,48,48,0.9,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='yjqjf8')>,,/r/HomeImprovement/comments/yjqjf8/new_metal_roof_do_i_keep_the_left_overs_for/,,,False
95,yes,AutisticAdults,2022-09-12 02:08:18,MyBrainsPOV,Identity question: Where does autism end and character and personality begin?,"How do you decide for yourself if something is because of you experiencing life through the lens of autism or because of who you are as a person? I feel like its likely a huge gray area and that everything that makes you YOU is painted with a brush that was first dipped into a bit of autistic paint and I feel like no experience can be had that isnt tinted a bit by that fact. 

But I really struggle now trying to figure out what parts of me are me and what parts are because I'm likely on the spectrum. 

I firmly believe that regardless of diagnosis that underneath it all is a person. Yes, shaped by their diagnosis, but there is a degree of personal choice and personality that shapes you regardless of your diagnosis. 

My question about myself is essentially ""who am I""? What parts of me are just me, and what parts are me covered in bruises from my diagnosis beating me down over the years? 

I take responsibility for everything that I do. But I try to give myself grace for being able to do more than I possibly would be able to do if I didnt try so hard. 

It's really weird. I dont know whether to be proud of myself of upset with myself because so many things are in the gray area.

My parents worked in a ""group home"" which was, in the 80's/90's what we called an institution that had various mentally challenged people. There was down syndrome, there was manic depressive violence, there was simply mentally challenged people. I went to the Special Olympics with these people and cheered them on as my friends. And when some of them became suddenly violent or unable to complete a task I never thought of it as a character trait. I always felt like they were buried under the burden of their condition.

So now I wonder a lot, thinking back over my life, and am having a bit of an identity crisis. Were those moments that haunt me my own responsibility and poor decisions that I made; or was I operating at a disadvantage and should be kind to myself. 

This is the thing right now that is really hurting my heart and mind.

It's a private company that I work for. Right now it's worth nearly $320k and by next year it should be worth over half a million dollars. In two years it could very realistically be worth over 1 million. It's very hard to walk away from this. However, I'm terrified having everything in one place that I cant even touch until they tell me I can. I am new to investing (besides accruing this stock) and am equally afraid of putting it into the stock market and have really bad FOMO. 

My biggest fear is selling stock, paying taxes on the capital gains, then taking that reduced amount and investing it elsewhere and watch it grow at less-than-even-anticipated lower rates; all while the single stock continues to skyrocket. 

I know that the right thing to do is diversify. But I cant help but feel like I'm walking away from such a huge opportunity. 

Part of me says that the current value, while high, isn't something that will significantly impact my life; especially after taxes. So maybe I just pretend it doesnt exist and cross my fingers and take that risk. The other part of me says cut and run, take control of the money and dont look back.

Prior to my MIL moving out we always had the option of one or both kids staying at home; so what I had for a car never really mattered until now. 

Both my kids are special needs and my wife has a bad knee (knee replacement and constant pain) so she cannot comfortably drive my vehicle and it's too cramped for one of my girls. 

My wife has a 2019 Honda Ridgeline and I have a 2015 Hyundai Sonata. 

I would like to keep my fuel efficiency as close to what I've currently got as possible. I dont really care about the year of the vehicle, but I do want one that's got fairly low miles on it. Like under 60k if possible but at least no worse than what I've currently got which is about 85k. The number is arbitrary really as some cars last a lot longer than others so I am not stuck on this really. 

Sure, I want a nice car, something clean and comfortable to drive. I do like my Hyundai a lot but it has some issues that worry me like door handles keep coming off  for example. 

I pretty much came down to the Honda CRV or Mazda CX-5. I like the Mazda a lot more but sounds like its smaller by enough to be significant. 

Will be trading in my car (or private sale) to put towards the new vehicle and total budget is 20-25k. Cash only. I'd need a really good argument to finance something. I will have to steal this money from some other project it's already earmarked for but it is what it is.

Their journey in life is much more difficult than mine. 

I am curious if you are near/on this possibly narrow cusp of considering yourself to be high functioning (and I understand if the upsets you because it means you are doing better than some but still having severe issues). That, and what does it mean to you? 

Do you have any guilt being on this cusp?

Are you depressed?

Do you feel lucky?

Personally I seem to check all the boxes of high functioning, feelings be damned, but I feel powerfully limited.

I have a 10 year plan to pay off my house that doesnt pull from any current savings. I have about $320k in company stock that should be double that in 2-5 years and I will be pulling about $15,000 per year minimum from that in the coming years for that 10 year plan of paying off the house. I may also take additional money out of that to transfer into more traditional and diversified investment options. 

I have never had a 401k plan. I am kind of overwhelmed by the process of choosing investments. I am trying to avoid managed accounts and paying a financial investor if possible. I chose these based on how old they were, their long term growth, and their minimal impact from the current financial dip. 

When I choose this I will divest my 15% into my company stock down to 5% so between stock and 401k I will be at 20% investing for my entire family (single income). 

Like I said we're debt free and doing fine. I think we'll be ok with 20% but I want to make sure my picks here are solid/ok. Thoughts? Thank you!

But should I consider doing an official diagnosis and why?  

I really appreciate the community's stance on self-diagnosis. The only reason I have considered pushing beyond what's required is because I just generally have a wonder about this. Also, I mentioned to my uncle and he said that I'm probably not autistic I'm just reading into a thing from my childhood. 

I dont want my clinical experience to be something that can be denied just because I dont have an official retort. I either am or I either am not autistic. So I guess I want to know, officially.

102,yes,adultautism,2022-06-16 05:02:43,MyBrainsPOV,I'm mad and my heart is breaking and I dont know what to do,"I feel like I have to start every post here saying that I am self diagnosed. That's not what I'm mad about by the way lol. I just want to explain that I have not officially been diagnosed. I've taken tests online, read some stuff on here, generally been blown away having my own thoughts and feelings explained by other people as their experience of reality for the first time in my life.

This has been a short but very intense  journey for sure. 

So, I am 40 years old. I have always been an introvert. I have always felt different. Once upon a time I thought that I might possibly be God reincarnate to experience the alien human race experience. That's true.  I didn't feel special and it wasn't some megalomaniac thing. I just felt like I was a scientist or something. An observer. 

I always somehow though felt like I was normal. I felt more normal than those around me. I have always felt like the people in my life were so fucking strange. Like, what's up with these people? They have these rituals and obsessions and are so fucking mean. 

All of my inner thoughts and feelings and insecurities and weird behaviors I felt were normal. I felt like at the very most I was just more in tune with myself than the people around me. Like I was understanding how weird everything is while everyone else just floated through life oblivious. 

I do not like events or gatherings. I do not like vacations. I do not like the idea of hanging out with someone. My parents just recently died and I was very briefly sad and then that passed and now I am ok with it. I do not have friends that I hang out with after work and I wouldn't want to if I was invited. I remember being sad about being lonely when I was younger but now it is my comfort spot. 

I have my routines down to a science and sometimes, when I break them; I fall apart. Literal example: today I didn't feel comfortable backing out my driveway the way I usually do because the across-the-street-neighbor were having driveway work done and I figured ""I'm smart enough to figure out how to get to the convenience store by going a different way"" and left my street by the opposite end because I was more comfortable backing out at that angle and I got FUCKING LOST IN MY OWN NEIGHBORHOOD FOR 20 MINUTES. 

I unsuccessfully used Google maps to try to find the store I wanted to go to. I've lived here for 3 years. My maps were stuck in walk mode because at work I use walk mode to show drivers how to navigate the Space Force Base where Google doesn't let you do drive mode. I couldn't get out of it. I lost my fucking mind in my own neighborhood of 3 years  and was late to work because I initially just had to go around the block. \*sigh\*

I have honestly thought and felt that whatever this experience of mine was that it was unique to me. That these were my faults and my frustrations. 

I am the most forgetful person on the planet and it means that I am not taking the time to pay attention and that I don't care about people according to people close to me. I have no idea where anything is, what I've done prior to today, and unless you describe exactly what the thing you're looking for looks like I will not find it. Looking for a 1 gallon jug of milk but turns out you bought a quart? I will do my very fucking best and ultimately not find the quart because I was looking for a gallon.

I can drive a car and generally navigate through life but I sometimes stare at credit card machines and panic because I'm not sure which version of ""credit"" I'm supposed to choose. 

I'm afraid to buy certain things because sometimes when I do the clerk starts making assumptions and asking questions and I really dont understand why they are injecting themselves into my personal life but fuuuuuuck apparently thats how people enjoy interacting with each other. 

And I have lived 39 years thinking this was all just me. That I was weird. That I was unique. That I alone lived this way. In a way I had comfort in that because I could say to myself that I was ""off"" but passing, for the most part, and that hopefully no one ever really caught on that I was a little confused about this whole ""life thing"". I felt responsible. I tried to fix me and I used masking and mirroring to figure out to be a ""normal human being"". I fucking apologized to my core for being who I was. 

And then I tried to read a book (Look me in the eye) and a few years later took a few online tests and had my mind blown. I have lived 40 years thinking this was all me, and that I was alone with this. I'm not officially diagnosed but by this point, after these tests, after my interaction with people on reddit and conversations and  expanding my understanding of autism... I guess that I am autistic and it fucking explains EVERYTHING. 

So now I'm here feeling like a fraud because I've been a step-father to autistic kids for 10 years and never, not a single fucking time, did I ever say ""oh I know what they are going through"". And I now have the absurdity to go ""oh yeah, me too!"" I cant begin to explain the gut punch of discovering that your unique experience in life suddenly has a name, and it's a name you've struggled with in having your kids navigate through life, it's nothing like what they are dealing with, and you just have to fucking deal with that like its cement firming up around your feet as you sink into to ocean of self pity. 

My heart is breaking because I feel like I'm doing some  Munchausen syndrome shit to my kids. To be fair I think like attracts like and I am so greatful for the family that I ended up with, and I hope that I can help my kids with my perspective, but I feel like I'm a big fat phony here with this. My kids suffer so much with this in ways that I have such an advantage with that they dont have. 

And I'm fucking furious. I am so mad. I am mad at my parents. I know they knew something but they never told me. I am grateful in one hand that they ""let me grow up normal"" not knowing anything was wrong, but on the other hand it would have been so helpful to know. Then again, it was the 90s and I dont know how much help I would have gotten. 

I'm mad because I'm learning other people apparently are experiencing this pain. I wish that I was the only one on the planet feeling it. 

I'm mad because I dont know what to do next. I dont know if an official diagnosis matters. 

I'm mad because I just want this to end. I'm sick of my obsessions and how my special interests change and bother those around me and how I'm viewed as unreliable. 

I'm mad because I need to do things that are boring to me and that boring is like an end of the world feeling and it means that I cant put my special interest power into things that I dont care about but I want to care about and ultimately that hurts people that I love. 

I'm just bitter now. I used to shrug off my weirdness and try to play normal. Now I have real anger. I wake up and I'm blaming my parents in my head for not getting me help. I'm blaming my family for not accepting my crappy behavior as a side affect of whatever this is. I'm blaming myself for having side effects that affect my family. I'm just mad all the time now.  It oscillates between anger at myself and anger at those around me like a neutron bomb and I'm honestly scared because I dont know when or how this emotional response is going to end. I have never felt this emotionally unbalanced in my life.

I am 40 years old and life has been so frustrating and uncomfortable. I hate small talk and think it's an insane waste of time and I feel like I'm doing a little skit when I have to perform it. I am supposedly the strange one in the building but apparently neurotypical people think it's perfectly fine to just stand in front of what you need in the grocery store and you have to wait for them to perform their little ritual of looking confused as they stare at the products so close to the shelving that you have to wait for them to move for you to get the one thing you want. But I'm strange for not wanting to talk to them and ask them to move. 

Today I was in the new lunch room of the building we're going to be moving into and everyone was so close and just bumping around and I did my best to stand out of their way but everywhere I went was apparently where they wanted to go so I was constantly in their way. 

I bounce between feeling like I'm in everyone elses way and that everyone else is always in my way. I find this especially problematic in my house. Our fridge is in a doorway to our kitchen and if you use the fridge you block that route. There is another route through our house but its a bit awkward. I have considered paying to move the fridge out of that blockage area and releasing that route but sometimes I feel like that's super extreme and maybe crazy? 

I'm just so glad that I dont live in a high density area where you have to get into tightly packed trains. I see videos of that and I am just so grateful that I'm not there. 

I know that these feelings are mine alone and that I have to deal with it. I rationalize that I am having irationational reactions to these environments and that I have to calm down and distance myself from the feelings. I'm working very hard on that

But I still feel like everyone else is crazy. 

Before I ever considered I may be neurodivergent  I  figured that I was just weird or stupid. I put a lot of self-hate on myself for not belonging.  I hate attention and often feel like if I'm forced to stand up for myself that I am either extremely misunderstood and then have to step up my self-defense to make the other person super understand that the misunderstanding was a mistake (of theirs) and that  my intentions were always pure and that I am innocent and I hope that they have an ah-ha moment and absolve me of the misunderstanding (but it never happens that way and I always walk away feeling like a victim and also the perpetrator).

What would you recommend I do for investing right now, in June 2022 with a crashing market and looming recession? I have no debt except the house. I have some cash from a parent passing situation. I have no 401k. I am 40 years old. My only other assets is stock in my company that I am pretty much going to pretend doesn't exist because selling it now could pay off my house but selling it in 5 years could fund my entire retirement. 

&#x200B;

I was playing with a mortgage pay-early calculator and it looks like if I put 50k towards my house then I'd save around 50 in interest. The higher I go from there, the interest savings starts tapering off (so 100k doesn't save 100k in interest it only saves $80k). 

&#x200B;

I get that the market is ""on sale right now"" but I have zero knowledge or toes dipped in yet, so I am not necessarily scared to invest I'm just very wet behind the ears and am nervous I'll jump in too early. I was thinking maybe 50k to my mortgage and 50k into the market at ""some point"" but want to get this community's advice.

I know there's strong feelings about Dave Ramsey. I am not an idol worshipper so you don't need to save me but I do think he helps a lot of people. But again, I am open to all sorts of ideas.

He told us he'd charge $1,600 for one and $1,700 for the other (includes the mini-splits, hardware, and labor). I'm nervous that this may be overkill for what we want for our bedroom so I wanted to ask here hoping I might save us from a mistake. Our bedroom is on the opposite end of the house as the 3 ton air handler and we often feel a little too warm in our room at night. I assume its because we close our door and are so far away from the AC. We do have a small fan over our bed and my wife wants to change that out but I'm worried we spend $500+ to upgrade the fan and are still warm blowing warm air around and end up going with a mini-split after that. In the other hand, I'm nervous we install this mini-split and it's always too cold in there lol. Please let me know if one is a better idea than the other; if there's an option I am unaware of, and thank you very much for your time. (the other mini-split is pretty much a definite go.

112,yes,AutisticAdults,2022-04-07 04:04:34,MyBrainsPOV,Safe space vehicles for day trips - thinking of going crazy here,"Hi everyone, so I have an idea to bounce off of you. We're thinking long term and trying to come up with ways to make half and full day car trips something to look forward to vs something to feel trapped in. So in this scenario lets pretend that price doesnt matter. We're considering a few options:

1. A minivan. Yaaaaay! Who doesnt love minivans? Except me and my wife? But who else?! Pro is they are much cheaper than the other options and offer plenty of space to ""feel comfortable"". The Sienna is ugly as sin but has twice the warranty. The Kia Carnival looks like an oversized badass SUV but in the videos I've seen getting into the third row seating looks hard to do. 
2. A big-ass-camper! This is actually awesome but its huge and difficult to drive. And this is kind of a lead in to a thought process we are playing with: when we get to the destination we essentially have a whole damn apartment on wheels. 
3. A tow camper! OMG so much cheaper than option 2. We could literally get my dream SUV and get a brand new towing camper for the price of a powered RV. 
4. Bigass SUV! I am leaning towards the Wagoneer but it's like twice the cost of top end minivans. 
5. Wagoneer plus towing rv! My dream combo but  obviously fucking insanely expensive. 

&#x200B;

The thought process here is to ""bring home with us"" in some fashion. Whether its some convenience and space or an outright rv that we tow along, we want to make going out not seem so much like something you want to opt out of. I have 2 autistic kids and this would be their safe space. My oldest is now 18 so she can stay by herself in the parking lot in whatever method of madness we decide on. My youngest could potentially stay with her though I'm not quite there yet. That's not a statement about my oldest it's more about leaving my youngest alone in public even if in a locked vehicle or RV. Maybe in another year or two. 

&#x200B;

Lets say this was you. Would this rock your world? Or am I not explaining this properly? So like; almost everywhere we go my oldest wants to stay in the car and my youngest generally joins her within an hour. So the idea here is to give them more than  car to go back to (minivan, rv, whatever) so they can feel super comfortable and happy, and some or all of us adults could continue shopping. A single adult may have to come back at least for now until my youngest is a bit older. I could potentially add some cameras to the rig so we can keep an eye on them remotely. 

If it werent for Walmart delivery and having our mother in law living with us we would never be able to leave the house, shop, etc. WE are so lucky we're in 2022 with modern conveniences. But even when we go out to do something fun the whole trip is a bit much. So.... 

1. we are prepared to spend more than we're comfortable spending in order to get a high luxery vehicle since it will open up travel for us. 
2. we are prepared to turn ordinary outings into camping situations if it brings some order and comfort to our kids lives
3. how would you feel with any of this?

113,yes,AutisticAdults,2022-04-06 04:50:07,MyBrainsPOV,Self-diagnosed and feeling like a fraud,"For 40 years I've done my god damn best to be a ""normal person"". I have equally desired close friendship as well as deeply dreaded it.  Eye contact conversations are my kryptonite. I just learned about the term ""masking"" and I have apparently spent my entire life learning to master it. The negative part of my performance reviews at work have always been about my personal interaction skills and I have been significantly monetarily compensated for meeting and exceeding my manager's expectations of my ability to address those concerns. I now lead a team in logistics.  

I am fucking exhausted at the end of the day mentally. The only time I feel like myself is when I drive  home and sing, and scream, and laugh until I cry.  I have been depressed for 20 years. And now here I am at 40, being sidelined with a realization that I meet a diagnosis that I feel like someone should have recognized and been like ""hey you really seem like this"".  I dont blame anyone I'm just  shocked.  

My children are autistic. We're not biologically related but I feel like a fraud ""discovering"" at 40 that I'm apparently also on the spectrum. I love my kids. I feel like them learning this is going to make them feel like I'm a Munchausen patient clinging onto their diagnosis as my own. I fear this could hurt them severely. My oldest son is accepting but he's also my kid who's most able to live on his own. I fear what this will do to my girls. They experience this so much more intense than I do. Is it even fair to say that I ""suffer"" when they are so much more affected by this than I am? 

Let me put this into my perspective: I am in mental discomfort every day. But I also am the single income for a family of 5 and we also partially support my son and his fiancée.  None of us get public assistance though my kids are on state care vs through my insurance at work. We live paycheck to paycheck this way but comfortably so. I have nothing to complain about and everything to be grateful about. 

I log into these chat rooms and I am comforted talking to people who are experiencing what I'm experiencing. But it also depresses me because a short while ago one of the things that I was grateful for was that no one else on earth had to experience life the way that I was. It just seems so unfair. I'm sorry for those experiencing life the same as me out there. 

I plan to start writing again, after 20 years, very soon. I dont know what will come of it. But I am working on moving from that unknown part of my life of 40 years and shift into the next 20-40 and try to make some sense of it and be somewhat productive. 

I'm changing therapists right now per my last therapist. She thinks her strengths dont really match my needs. I think although I liked working with her that she's right. I will be a lot more open with my next therapist and make sure I express how important some of this conversation is with her. I am kind of bummed that I'm going to miss a week but I'll make the following week worth while. I mean, I hope so. 

Thank you for those who have these subreddits and conversations. I hope to learn and grow a lot because of it.

114,yes,realestateinvesting,2022-04-02 00:31:01,MyBrainsPOV,"How do you calculate basis for long term capital gains if you don't have receipts? Also, a title settlement question regarding it's impact on my tax liability.","Hey guys! I have two specific questions that I wanted to ask the community. I have a CPA that I am going to meet with but I wanted a wider set of opinions that I could work with to bring to the table for my CPA and I to discuss regarding this. 

So here is the situation: I bought a house in 1999 for $110,000. I am now selling it for $405,000. 

1. I had to settle with descendants of who I purchased the house from to clear the title. Turns out, when the husband passed away his half interest did not go to his wife. So when I bought the house from her, she didn't have the legal right to sell his half interest. I had to settle that issue by paying out a total of $30,000. It's worded in the agreement that this is a  payment of inheritance settlement. Can I add this to my basis?
2. Over 20 years have passed since I've bought the house. The roof has been replaced. The kitchen has been remodeled. I replaced the boiler pretty recently. We also replaced some of the flooring. How do I calculate this stuff without receipts? My CPA says if I over-estimate that it can just be 100% rejected which is terrifying. I am not looking to screw the government out of anything but these costs really happened over the years. 
3. It's my understanding that I can add agent fees etc so I assume that includes the over $20k that I'm about to pay during closing?
4. Regarding attorney fees that can be deducted; does that include what I had to spend to resolve this title issue? It's well over $5k so far between what I paid my lawyer and agreed to pay their lawyer. 
5. Are there any other things you can think of that get overlooked that owning a house for 20 years, but not living in it (my parents lived in it) that I can add to the basis? 

I appreciate any responses and feedback. I hope this isn't inappropriate. As I said, I do have a CPA and am working on setting up an appointment with him in the coming weeks. The house closes on April 8 and I'm just anxious to figure out what my tax liabilities are going to be.

116,yes,personalfinance,2022-03-12 01:38:07,MyBrainsPOV,How should I structure a monetary gift to my foster brother after our shared parents have passed away?,"Here is our story: When I was 17 years old, in 1999, my step-mother was her grandmother's POA. It was time for her grandmother to go into 24/7 care and in course of her transitioning from living in her own place to moving into elder care; I purchased her house from her (through my step-mother as POA)\*. When I was 18, I moved out of the house and went to college; and my parents fostered a child around that same time. 

I am now 40 years old and he's about half that. We didn't have much overlap, but his experience of growing up was with my parents as his parents. Now that both parents have passed, and I am about to sell the house, I am trying to figure out how best to help my foster brother out. 

The details aren't yet established on the sale of the house but I should be able to give him somewhere between $45k-60k. The original idea was to ""take care of him"". That was what my parents wanted and I am truly excited to help realize that goal.

Where he lives, it is impossible to get into literally any living situation on that small investment. You cant even get into a mobile home park with that. So, the question is; what is the best way for me to help him? Do I....

1) Just give him the money and wish him good luck.

2) Give him the money and have a structured conversation with him about how best to use it, but leave it up to him.

3) Set up a trust or a mutual fund or something else, hand it over to him, and wish him luck.

4) Take an uncomfortable amount of control over this aspect of his life and be like a ""controller of the money"" somehow? Maybe put the money into some scenario where he cant touch it for a certain amount of time. I dunno...

5) Not give him any money, for now, work on growing it under my full control and give it to him at a later date. The idea here being that supposedly me being older means I'm somehow better with money and that I'll just manage it for the next 10-20 years then give him it when ""he's more mature"" and it's much more money and much more impactful and we're all pretending that I can control this entire process and he's in an amazing place in life when I give him the money...

6) Some other idea?

&#x200B;

\* The house is 100% mine. It is not an inheritance. There is no legal requirement to share the proceeds from the sale of the house. Also; I am 100% committed to this idea. He'll get the money; I am just trying to figure out what is the best way to help him out in the long run. I came into money when I was young and I wasted a lot of it. I don't want to burden him with me being some kind of caretaker of his future, but I also don't want to take this opportunity that he has and just throw it away if there's a better option here.

I just got through several extremely difficult years, and now with the pandemic, I'm majorly struggling to stay motivated at my job. I work part time and remotely, so it's totally up to me to get my work hours done.

I just moved to a new city, so trying to get established during a pandemic has been overwhelming. Not to mention that the messaging from ""on high"" is all about ""stay away from others to keep everyone safe."" I feel guilty for feeling desperate for human, in person contact with others, like I should be able to suppress those needs because of the messaging from leaders 

I just got out of several years of difficult health issues that were extremely isolating, then over a year of some sort of post traumatic stress, and now I'm attempting to move forward in life and I feel like I'm making so little progress. I keep wanting to do this or that but lacking I dunno the willpower or energy or motivation to get up off my rear end and take action.

Well, that's not exactly true. I am getting some things done. But the things I really want to do, like play my instrument or get involved in outdoor activities or learn a new instrument - I'm trying to take steps, but find myself having a ton of trouble knowing how to deal with obstacles in the way. Some sort of paralysis.

I just want to cry. But I've spent so much time crying the last few years. I'm sick of it. And I don't know how to figure out the reasons behind why I'm having trouble with various things lately. There are so many things I want to do or see, but I feel so stuck 

And I feel so lonely. I'm making attempts to reach out, but it goes so slowly. Thankfully, I'm living with people, but its older relatives. I'm really longing for some people of all ages to talk with and live life with.

And the thing is, I'm supposed to be looking for a new job right now.

I used to have social anxiety and worked through it, but my illness has brought back some of the feelings of nervousness.

I'm not nervous to interact with other people in general. I love meeting new people and getting to know them. However, I'm nervous about navigating the social life, being socially acceptable.

I am also nervous about dating and falling in love. I've never done that before.

My ADHD always tends to exacerbate whatever feelings I have. Nervousness, excitement, happiness, sadness - whatever the emotion, my ADHD magnifies it and I experience it to an at times overwhelming degree.  I have to ""ride out the storm,"" and I'm not in control of it. This can make life fun, but it can also make it scary.

I do not deal well with uncertainty and change, and getting back into social life - and getting into dating people for the first time - might be challenging. Probably when I reach new milestones, dating people will have benefits that make the hard parts worthwhile, but it's hard to see that when you've never been there before and you feel afraid.

Can I navigate this and come out okay?

I got put on a client 2 weeks ago and I rationally think that the work I've done is fine so far, but I don't feel that way, and the experience is so anxiety provoking. I hate having expectations set on myself because I get so anxious about potentially not meeting them. Also my role is kind of open ended which makes it hard for me to feel satisfied with what I have done. There isn't the (incredibly satisfying) clear positive/negative feedback in the form of grades. 

Not to mention the social component of it all - I have gotten along with people at work just fine but I feel like I need act more energetic than I truly am in order to fit in. I am facing the same issue I used to face where I can make good surface level friendships, but I cannot really connect with anyone in a way that feels meaningful.

For a while my aspiration in life has been to just find a relatively well paying job that I feel comfortable with, so that outside of work I have the energy to actually live a life I enjoy. But I can't help but feel like maybe that's not possible at all. Maybe the baseline stress levels and expectations of a job will always be too much for me to tolerate. Maybe that, compounded with how hard it is for me to connect with people and how much energy chores take me will prevent me from living a truly comfortable life.

Landlord is asking for a deposit + 1 month's rent before signing the lease,"My friend and I got a nice offer for a 2-bed apartment in Dublin, and I just don't want to get scammed. I'm just afraid that he'll take the money and go and I'll have no way to have it refunded.  I rented a room during college before, but that was by word of mouth so trust wasn't an issue, and otherwise I am a first time renter.

We viewed the property on Saturday and took pictures, it was in good condition and the landlord seemed nice. He emailed us the offer and a tenancy agreement which neither of us have signed yet, and which doesn't have our names in it but does have the address of the property. I had a read through it and it seems fine.

He has provided his IBAN and account name and is asking for a payment of the deposit and 1 month's rent right now by bank transfer, and I just feel uncomfortable making the transfer without having a written and signed agreement in place. In hindsight I should have at least asked to see his ID during the viewing.

He said he had recently retired and is using rent as a steady income. One of my references also let me know that he called a few hours before he sent me the offer email.

What should I do? Make the transfer and request a receipt? Only send him the deposit and wait until the lease is signed to transfer 1st month's rent? Refuse to pay anything until we have signed the lease? Request some form of ID?

Thanks in advance.

EDIT 1: I mentioned that we'd rather only pay the 1st month of rent upon signing the contract, so he offered to meet up tonight to do that. Already transferred the deposit, so we'll see how that goes.

So today, I was playing on a public piano because I had time to kill. Now, the piano sounds terrible (since last week it has been broken, all the notes are sustained even when you let go of them, so if you play fast, all the notes kind of blend in.)

I was just learning this ( https://imgur.com/a/v9EbJae ) bit of a simplified version of turkish march for the first time, playing it very, very slowly and sometimes incorrectly. I have only been playing for 3.5 months (self taught) and I was fairly sleep deprived, so it was quite sloppy.

But despite that, at one point, a young girl (8ish?) walked over to me with who I assume was her younger brother and asked me if she could give me €1 because ""I play so well"". Now, I was totally embarrassed because it almost felt like a prank since I was playing so badly. So I was like ""haha I'm not playing well. I can't take that,"" but she insisted, and now I am €1 richer.

Afterwards some guy started hovering near me and when I got up to leave he was like ""gotta go? That was really nice.""

I have had a few other circumstances (albeit when I was playing better), e.g. when someone said I just made their day after I played a nice song (again, not too complex at all, since I'm new. It was actually a simplified piano version of la valse d'amelie)

I have read a little bit on this claim and on the surface it does seem accurate and like a reasonable reason to be hesitant of taking the COVID vaccine (at least, in the early times of the vaccine. Not so much now that plenty of time has passed to monitor its long-term effects).

Obviously drugs are different then vaccines, so I wonder how relevant this is because of that distinction.

I am not looking for arguments made with the benefit of 2 years of hindsight in terms of the COVID vaccine, more so from the POV of early COVID days.

200,yes,autism,2022-12-11 15:36:43,No_Boysenberry_7138,Had an extremely weird and unsettling experience after my yoga nidra and a dream," I am going to include lots of seemingly relevant context here, so this post is very long.

This feels like the first time I so viscerally described an experience of mine, especially such a weird one. Don't be mean. Part of me is afraid I am making no sense.

I have been doing yoga nidra (a kind of lying-down meditation) for over a year and a half now. I found it near the start of my discovery journey as an autistic, although yoga nidra is particularly relevant to me realising that dulling my physical tension is **crucial** to improving my mental health (I basically, without knowing much about autism, indepdently found what overstimulation feels and how to cope with it). As time has gone by, I have learned to do it in the exact same conditions:

* After breaking my fast at noon (I only eat from 12-8pm, for over a year), with the **exact** same meal (I wrote about this meal in my post somewhere)
* In my bed with a memory foam mattress and under a weighted blanket, with nothing but underwear and socks.
* With headphones on, but on the loosest possible configuration and with both the top of my headphones and the side of the ear cuffs resting against the pillow, to prevent them from feeling too tight on my head/ears.
* Usually in the same pose (savasana) or some variation thereof, e.g. with wrists on my belly to alleviate hand tingling/numbness (not to self-diagnose but I think I have some subclinical CTS - long story, won't go into it)

I don't do it every day, there are many times I didn't do it for weeks. But I love it. That being said, it's effects on me have changed a decent bit over time. One thing I started experiencing eventually was that I would fall asleep during yoga nidra! This was crazy to me because I can **never** take naps. Unless I am **very** sleep deprived, if I wake up at my usual time in the morning then I won't be able to fall asleep until the evening. But here I was, falling asleep for anywhere from 30-120 minutes during noon!

That being said, when I would wake up, I felt... weird. I felt like my head was very empty (mentally, but also physically, like I am light headed) - much more so than when I wake up in the morning. I also felt like I **needed** water and the freshest air possible. like the air I was breathing is dirty. My throat felt a **little** bit like I had just thrown up. It wasn't an issue, I would just get up, drink water and stand around for a bit (maybe go to the garden) and the unpleasant feeling would go away. The big benefit was that my head would (mentally) still remain empty, which would make it much easier to focus on things, particularly productive tasks. The temptation to do more instantly gratifying things like playing games, watching yt, browsing social media, etc. was very much diminished. Currently, I am writing this post on such a ""high"".

So moving to today. Today was cold. I woke up a bit chilly and was a bit cold when chilling in my room. So I decided to keep my sweater and sweatpants on while I did yoga nidra. I knew that it would be slightly more unpleasant due to the physical restriction that wearing these **and** being under a weighted blanket would bring, but I felt it was worth the extra warmth.

So I did it. I fell asleep quickly enough, and I woke up once(dogs were barking), took my headphones off, and fell back asleep.

Then I had the dream. It was more of a nightmare. The best way to describe how it felt was **suffocating**. I was meant to have my session at 12:30pm with a therapist I am attatched to but haven't seen in a few months for reasons (I am seeing someone else rn, also I have an appointment with this older therapist tomorrow irl at 12:30). So I'm like ""ok, let's start walking there"". But time accelerates, and next thing I know I've been wandering for long enough that it is actually 12:20 but I haven't gone anywhere, and the map of my town is really confusing. So, distressed, I call my mother to drive me there. At one point I consider it more efficient to get out of the car in traffic, run, and get back into it later when it catches up(lol), but that confuses my mother (she didn't see me jump out of the car, allegedly) and we waste a lot of time. A few more time-wasters later we get to what is allegedly my therapists workplace. The building looks completely different, a big apartment complex basically.

I realise that I should spare you the details of the rest of the dream, otherwise I would write for a long time. Basically, a bunch of irrational stuff happens to me and I feel like I can't think straight at all, like e.g. when I go on my phone and try to click on ""messages"" but it brings me to a foreign looking app so I can't see my appointment confirmation text. The stairs have no stairs so I can't walk up, but I also can't use the elevator. I don't know which room it is so I can't ring the buzzer. Basically I am stuck there for the rest of the dream and feel horrendous, with lots of anxiety and brain fog. I am quite confident that this was partly induced by the extra physical restraint that came with wearing stuff under my weighted blanket, in a position where it would be hard to move without doing some uninituitive sliding movements (by that I mean that e.g. I wouldn't be able to just lift my arm up and over my torso cause of the blanket, I would have to slide it somewhere)

Then I wake up. It is 2 hours after I started yoga nidra. I feel light headed and lacking energy, which is never unusual initially. But I feel those things particularly strongly. I am sort of distressed about my dream, still don't **feel** I have woken up even though I kinda know that I did. I make a voice recording noting some of the dream. As before I have the feelings including thirst and like I need fresh air, so I dress up, drink a glass of water, and go to our garden. The fresh air feels great, but I still feel weird.

Here is when I realised something weird was happening. I basically walk around my garden completely on autopilot, doing weird shaky/flappy arm movements which I never do, and it feels like the conscious, rational, ""inner monologue"" part of my brain is completely deactivated. I just spend minutese walking, sometimes standing and just staring at some rock. At one point I start hitting my head repeatedly because my gut tells me to (I have this memory of doing that when I was very young, only to be told off by my teacher). My dog doesn't seem to like it and barks a bit at me (lol), so I stop a bit and pet her.

This feels like a weirdly autistic thing, but the fact that this hasn't really happened to me in recent memory makes me sceptical of that idea. I feel like if anyone tried to approach me and ask what's wrong, I would get get very distressed and try to physically stop them, but I also felt like if I wanted to, I could have activated the more conscious, ""inner monologue"" part of my brain to help me put on a normal face and act fine.

I don't really know what to think of this, and I don't really know what I expect from posting this. It just felt like a profound experience and important to take a snapshot of. Thanks for reading my snapshot. Took me like 30 minutes of typing on autopilot to write this.

Honestly part of me (/part of my definitely-not-medically-educated self) wonders if I just didn't breathe quite as much as I should have during sleep, and that's partly why I felt the way I did.",1,1,1,0.67,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='ziwokx')>,,/r/autism/comments/ziwokx/had_an_extremely_weird_and_unsettling_experience/,,,False

I am quite confident that this was partly induced by the extra physical restraint that came with wearing stuff under my weighted blanket, in a position where it would be hard to move without doing some uninituitive sliding movements (by that I mean that e.g. I wouldn't be able to just lift my arm up and over my torso cause of the blanket, I would have to slide it somewhere)

Then I wake up. It is 2 hours after I started yoga nidra. I feel light headed and lacking energy, which is never unusual initially. But I feel those things particularly strongly. I am sort of distressed about my dream, still don't **feel** I have woken up even though I kinda know that I did. I make a voice recording noting some of the dream. As before I have the feelings including thirst and like I need fresh air, so I dress up, drink a glass of water, and go to our garden. The fresh air feels great, but I still feel weird.

Here is when I realised something weird was happening. I basically walk around my garden completely on autopilot, doing weird shaky/flappy arm movements which I never do, and it feels like the conscious, rational, ""inner monologue"" part of my brain is completely deactivated. I just spend minutese walking, sometimes standing and just staring at some rock. At one point I start hitting my head repeatedly because my gut tells me to (I have this memory of doing that when I was very young, only to be told off by my teacher). My dog doesn't seem to like it and barks a bit at me (lol), so I stop a bit and pet her.

This feels like a weirdly autistic thing, but the fact that this hasn't really happened to me in recent memory makes me sceptical of that idea. I feel like if anyone tried to approach me and ask what's wrong, I would get get very distressed and try to physically stop them, but I also felt like if I wanted to, I could have activated the more conscious, ""inner monologue"" part of my brain to help me put on a normal face and act fine.

I don't really know what to think of this, and I don't really know what I expect from posting this. It just felt like a profound experience and important to take a snapshot of. Thanks for reading my snapshot. Took me like 30 minutes of typing on autopilot to write this.

I will describe what the keys are like compared to other pianos I have tried. My frame of reference is based off of:

1. My cheap €80 digital piano. It's keys were very light and so easy to press. You press them down a little bit (like 1/2 of the way down) and they make noise
2. A piano located at my local train station. The keys are much harder, and of course the harder you press the louder the noise, unlike the previous piano.

My new piano has weighted keys, but it seems rather strange in that its keys are quite light to press, more like piano 1 than 2. So to make notes louder I have to press the keys hard as if I am whacking the keys against the base of the piano. Whereas with 2 it feels more like the force is exerted evenly throughout the depression of the key if that makes sense.

Is this fine? Is there any way to sanity check that my weighted keys are working as intended? Would post a video of me playing help with this?

Thanks for reading, hope this makes sense. I am probably being paranoid for no reason lol

* Reading, or just being exposed to, lots of text at once
* Doing something physical. The more awkward, physically demanding, and novel, the more overwhelming 
* Playing video games
* Doing something that requires me to think a lot
* Sensory distractions - sound, sight, touch, taste, smell

I can avoid sensory distractions, but the other things can be very hard to avoid. The difficulty is that I also have the compulsion to do more stimulating things, because otherwise I feel kind of uncomfortable and often just bored. College often goes well for me because it gives me a chance to focus on something slow-paced for a long time, which tends to be less on the stimulating side and therefore kind of relaxing. But now that I’m out of college, and I won’t be starting work for a few months, I struggle to create that sort of external restriction on what I should do that college brings me.

229,yes,HunterXHunter,2022-06-26 10:15:27,No_Boysenberry_7138,Has anyone tried a Hunter X Hunter themed D&D campaign before?,"I just did my first session of my first D&D campaign recently, and I have been thinking that the interesting world and detailed power system of hxh would lend itself sooo well to a D&D style campaign, although perhaps an unorthodox one.

I think the power system specifically is especially important here, because it allows for massive amounts of creativity and cool abilities, while also being constrained by the rules of nen. If we got a group of people who were all familiar with how nen works and the hxh universe, I feel like it would be a super fun thing to try - and battles could be really interesting. We could choose personalities, and then the DM might suggest to us what kind of abilities (based on nen type) those might correspond to. Maybe we could roll dice to determine if someone is a specialist (1 in 15 chance maybe?). I am thinking that maybe the DM could have a short one-on-one session with each character discussing what kind of abilities they can have, and the player can decide without the other players knowing. It might be fun to role play a group of characters who don't yet trust each other enough to reveal the entirety of their abilities.

As for the background of campaign, a simple one could probably be based in a game just like greed island - that would make building a campaign much easier I feel. Although at the same time, it would add an extra layer of complexity due to all the different cards that exist/ that you could make up. We could take inspiration from pre existing abilities or even characters (that would help since we have drawings already available for pre existing characters). 

The players would presumably be familiar with the hxh universe quite well (I watched the anime twice, read the remaining manga, scoured the wiki a decent bit, and have watched plenty of videos about hxh). Because otherwise I feel like it would be a headache to explain nen. People who know about nen might have more creativity when it comes to their abilities, and more importantly they would have a better understanding of how other people's abilities might work, which would make battles work more smoothly.

Obviously since I am super new to D&D I wouldn't be able to DM a campaign yet, especially one as creative as a hxh campaign.

I do intermittent fasting and I break my fast every day with a 1000 kcal 2-part meal.

1. Southern fried chicken fillet wholemeal wrap with a leaf salad of your choice (I buy [this one](https://www.tesco.ie/groceries/en-IE/products/268450236)), [sauce](https://blenders.ie/products/mayonnaises/garlic-mayonnaise/) of your choosing, and a slice of cheese (whatever cheese you like! I only like adding cheese if I use put the wrap in the george foreman later). I also stick it in a george foreman grill for 3 minutes - It improves the taste by A LOT and it makes it nearly impossible for the wrap to fall apart. [Here is an example](https://imgur.com/pBMMROz) and [another](https://imgur.com/RlqexJM) (of an unusually well assembled wrap I made). This is super convenient because since the southern fried chicken fillets are already breaded I just stick 4 into the oven one day, keep them in the fridge, and then for 4 days it barely takes me a few minutes to assemble the wrap. Almost 600 kcal overall.
2. Cottage cheese with banana and cinnamon. I just put 300g of [cottage cheese](https://imgur.com/7xJrU0X) in a bowl, slice up a banana(with a fork) into the cheese, and then mash it up by pressing the 4 ""teeth"" of the fork into the banana slices (This will make your fork bend over time, I have one specific fork I use for this). Then of course I add a bunch of cinnamon and mix it in with my fork. This takes longer than assembling the wrap, overall between 5 and 10 minutes.

She responded by telling me to go ahead and include any suggestions I felt may improve things, and when I thanked her she replied ""You are so great!  😊"". I'm not really sure if I'm supposed to respond to that, and if I am I have no idea what to say.

I know she probably has a friendlier than normal tone with me because she's (sort of) known me since I was younger (via occasional company holiday parties with my dad, etc), but that compliment just feels so broad that I really don't know how to address it gracefully.

I generally try not to be one of those people, but this whole situation just sucks and I need to let it out somewhere where it can hopefully be understood.

I've got major chest dysphoria (obviously). Before I knew I wanted T, I *knew* I wanted top surgery. Unfortunately, certain shitty circumstances prevented me from having access to it. [TW: SI] >!Not knowing if or when I could ever get surgery led to the worst depression I've ever gone through, and I made an attempt on my own life for the first time.!<

Finally, I'm now in a position where I might actually be able to get it covered. I immediately called up a nearby surgeon with a relatively short wait-list and asked for a consult. They told me they'd just need a letter of support from both my HRT prescriber and a therapist before moving forward.

I got the letter from my prescriber easily, but my therapist was taking a while. When I asked her about it in session, she told me that she 'couldn't sign in good conscience' until she knew for sure that 'all mental health conditions were under control'. I'm currently being assessed for a very stigmatized disorder, and have already been informally told the likelihood I have it is very high. My therapist wants to contact this specialist to make sure I have it 'under control'-- while I'm literally in the middle of even finding out it exists.

I understand her concern, I genuinely do. I know there's potentially very serious liability for her if she signs. But she's been with me through the depression, through the attempt, and she knows it was all directly due to my dysphoria. In all the time we've worked together, I've never once said or done anything to suggest I may ever change my mind about surgery.

Things have gotten so bad I've basically become a shut-in. I can't leave the house or be around people if I'm not binding. Unfortunately, my chest is fairly large comparable to my frame, so even when I am binding I'm still extremely self-conscious. I go through ridiculous amounts of trans tape, and every time I have to apply it in front of a mirror is pure torture. I start shaking all over and end up just dissociating tf out of my body through most of it.

I feel so lost and terrified. I'm going to try to contact other places to try to get a letter in case my therapist ends up refusing. I started a GoFundMe a long time ago, hoping I could just do it out of pocket, but unfortunately I never reached my goal. If I find out I have to wait *again,* or that possibly I may never be able to get it based on this diagnosis-- I just don't know how I could handle that. I just want to feel okay in my skin for once in my life, and not crippled by shame and disgust at the sight of my own body.

My personality and mannerisms are pretty 'generically masculine', at least when I'm just getting to know someone. I'm pretty quiet and closed off, and when I speak I don't have much inflection or anything.

Also, the way I dress is pretty 'heterodudecore' lmao. It's partially because I'm still in a bit of an awkward androgynous-ish phase in my transition (or at least I feel like I am, even though I'm never really read as female anymore), so presenting more stereotypically masc is a bit of a safety blanket. Also, I just kinda like dressing like this I guess? It's no different to how I dressed before-- comfy tees, flannels, jeans, sweats, sneakers, etc.

Problem is, pretty much everyone seems to just assume I'm a straight guy. Which is fine in most situations, I don't mind when the barber asks if I got a gf or whatever, but it's a bummer when I go to LGBTQ spaces and people don't seem to consider that I'm queer myself.

Last night I went a LGBTQ night club for the first time, and literally the only person who came and danced with me was a girl (and she kissed me too afterwards, which was sweet and she was very pretty and nice but that's just not really what I was looking for there). It probably didn't help that I was there with my femme-leaning cis lesbian friend, so from the outside we might have looked like a couple.

Anyone else have this problem? How can I subtly hint at the fact I'm not straight, without having to dress or speak in a way I don't want to?

258,yes,NonBinary,2023-02-26 23:08:27,serromani,Advice on prosthetics for AFABs in the bedroom? [NSFW],"TW for pretty detailed descriptions of sex stuff (sorry 😬).

I'm transmasc, and I'd really like to be able to top/penetrate more during sex than I do currently. It's something I always fantasize about, but so far reality has really not measured up.

I've tried a few different options, but none of them were quite right. The first was just a standard strap-on with a harness, but it was so hard to get a feel for it. The angle felt awkward and unnatural, I just couldn't get into a groove or anything, and since it didn't give me any actual sensation it was ultimately not really worth the effort.

Next I tried a strapless strap-on (that you insert into your own front hole so you don't have to use a harness), and I did actually like that one better. It was a lot more intuitive to use because I could actually feel it, so the movement was a lot easier to get the hang of. I wasn't a huge fan of the sensation it provided me though- it wasn't exactly stimulating or anything. It didn't feel bad, necessarily, but it didn't really feel good either.

So next I tried to look for products specifically designed for transmasc folks to use. I don't have a big budget for this kind of stuff, so I got something on the cheaper end to start with. It was off some Etsy shop, and it doubled as an STP/packer but had a rod insert that was meant to feel good on my bits too. Unfortunately, it ended up being basically same as the first strap-on in terms of awkwardness/difficulty to use, and there was barely any benefit for me in terms of stimulation (just kinda... Some rubbing, I guess).

I'm really looking for recommendations for what I should try next, and what sort of expectations I can really have. I'm starting to think maybe I should just go back to the second option I tried, because at least I felt I could perform okay with that one. But it would be really cool to find something that also actually made me feel good at the same time.

I just really freaking need to get laid (god I feel like a loser typing that out lol). This has been the longest dry spell for me since I was a literal chronological teenager. My confidence and body image are at an all-time low and my mental health is absolute garbage, so I'm really just looking for a FWB or even a ONS.

I've tried out quite a few other dating apps, but none of them hit that sweet spot of expectations that tinder did (as in there are a lot of people looking for something casual, but there's usually at least some amount of getting to know each other).

Grindr really isn't the vibe I'm looking for or used to, but tbh I'm getting a little desperate.

267,yes,trans,2023-02-16 00:08:28,serromani,In need of tips for supporting my cousin (16mtf) while she's still living with bigoted parental figures.,"Hey everybody. I'm trans(masc) myself, but I didn't figure that out about myself until my mid 20s so I've never had the experience of being a knowingly closeted trans teenager. I'm hoping others here can give me some tips or pointers for how to support my cousin while she's still a minor living with homo/transphobes.

She just came out to me privately a week ago. She's chosen a name and talked to me a bit about what her hopes for the future are regarding transition, etc. In the meantime, though, she lives with her mom/my aunt, who is honestly an awful parent (runs in the family unfortunately). Her mom's dating a very ""traditional"" guy who is constantly going on phobic rants to her while he drives her to and from school.

She has to sit and listen to him go on and on about how being gay and/or trans is the work of the devil, and that she (my cousin) just needs God in her life, which is what he's gonna do for her. She's not out to family other than me and my sister (for obvious reasons), but her mom has always been on her case for ""acting so feminine"", so it seems like she's recruited her bf to teach her how to be a ""real man"".

I'm really worried they'll get word of her identity via my sister, who's a religious fanatic and bigot herself. Idk why she chose to come out to her at all honestly (maybe because they're a little closer in age I guess), but of course that's her choice. Either way, it's done now.

I guess I just want to ask what I can do to be of maximum support for her? If you were a teen in this situation, what would have been the most helpful for you? I stay in touch with her daily and am always affirming, and always tell her that the BS her mom's bf and my sister spout at her isn't true. If her mom finds out and she's kicked out or something, I'll make sure she has somewhere to go and is provided for (I can probably take her in myself).

Other than that, though, is there anything I'm missing that could help her stay strong for these last couple of years that she's under their thumb?",6,7,7,0.82,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='113cr8b')>,,/r/trans/comments/113cr8b/in_need_of_tips_for_supporting_my_cousin_16mtf/,,,False

I only got 2 comments before I deactivated the entire account. ""1st was better"" and ""down grade"".

I know how pathetic it is to let stupid internet comments get to me like this, especially when I practically invited them myself by making that post. But I'm deeply, deeply insecure about no longer being ""pretty"", and those comments just sort of drove in the nail that was already lodged in.

My husband is straight. I'm bisexual. We got married in 2019, before my egg cracked. When I finally confronted my non-cisness in 2021, I was absolutely terrified of losing him as a result... Which I basically did.

We're still married, he says he still loves me... But he's not attracted to me anymore. He's not even a little heteroflexible, there is nothing about masculinity that he is attracted to whatsoever. He says I'm still a ""beautiful person"", and he doesn't want to lose me, but it's obvious our relationship will never be what it was-- what I had hoped it would be for the rest of our lives.

I've got boatloads of trauma going back to early childhood regarding my appearance. By age four I had literally, explicitly been taught that if I weren't pretty/cute enough, I had no value to anyone. Taking this leap into transitioning, letting go of the feminine appeal that I had clung to for survival my entire life, was the biggest risk I'd ever taken. Now all of the fears that kept me clinging to it for so long have come true.

I genuinely feel like I have no value in the world anymore. I didn't feel like I had much before, but at least I was pretty. That was enough to make people tolerate my presence. Now, I don't even have that.

I've just never felt lower. Sorry for dumping all this negativity here guys-- I just don't have anyone else to say this to, and I'm getting tired of crying alone.

I'm disabled and unemployed. I've never been able to hold down a job for too long, and therefore don't really have an established career.

I went to college briefly (about 2 years) for creative writing, but had to drop out because of the above mentioned health issues. However, I'm still pretty good at writing I guess (based on third party feedback at least).

I have a lot of fairly unique identity perspectives, mostly on mental health/neurodiversity (Autism/ADHD) and LGBTQ+ issues.

I've spoken publicly a few times about these things, mostly through the church I used to attend, but I am consistently told that I have a ""real gift"" for public speaking. I really don't know what that means exactly, but since so many people make such a point of bringing it up to me (even years after I last spoke), I figure it must be something I could make use of in some way.

So my question is, what can I possibly do with this combination of strengths? I'm really not able to keep up a normal 9-5 job at this time, but I do want to be able contribute in some way. I have no idea where one would look for a job to just... Make speeches, I guess?

280,yes,CPTSD_NSCommunity,2023-01-01 18:18:46,serromani,Is there anything different I need to know about healing now that I understand I actually underwent child torture?,"I recently realized that many of my experiences in childhood actually fall under the definition of ""child torture"" rather than abuse. This is the passage in a recent article I read that defined the difference for me:

""The authors of the study argue that torture contrasts with other forms of child abuse, which usually result from episodic unchecked anger or a loss of self-control in a person in charge of a child. Torture is more prolonged and designed to establish domination and control over a child’s psyche. Torture is carried out to physically and psychologically 'break' someone.""

[Full article here.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/slightly-blighty/201801/the-psychology-child-torture%3famp)

Essentially, it boils down to the difference between a parent getting angry and lashing out at a child versus them enacting a more complicated, pre-meditated plan over time designed to inflict harm and gain psychological and/or physical control.

My story does not align exactly with most descriptions of child torture (since it was not enacted on me by a parent/parents), but there's no denying that it was very systematic and my abuser was successful in ""breaking"" me. Many of my deepest core beliefs about myself were instilled through torture.

Now that I realize there is something of a difference between what I went through and other, more well-known forms of child abuse, I'm wondering if maybe there is a specific approach to healing that would benefit me more. Perhaps some resources that deal with this more specifically, or certain therapy modalities that may be more beneficial?

I apologize if this is a stupid question or if it comes across as insensitive in any way. I know that all abuse is evil and all survivors deserve the same amount of love and healing. I am just wondering if there is anything I can do with this new information to help me heal more, since I have been on this journey for a few years now and I'm feeling quite stuck.

As a child/teenager, I resembled more of an 8 than a 5. I grew up in an abusive home and very much took it upon myself to ""fight back"" and try to protect my younger sister.

However, life continued to not treat me so well, and over time I retreated more and more from the world. My strategy of pushing back against the world had gotten me nowhere, so I became passive and isolated. I have always been an intellectually-oriented person, so retreating to the sidelines, studying, and observing became my MO.

I relate heavily to the core fears and desires of a 5, but I am wondering if I have been confusing my need for competency as simply my adopted strategy for achieving the autonomy and control that I have always wanted (and never had).

It was my favorite day of the year. Since finding out I had C-PTSD, unpacking all of the trauma, and snapping out of the gaslight fog that my parents had me in, I have gone very LC.

Last year was the first year I did not do Christmas with them, and it was hard. Instead, I spent it with my husband and his family, which at least was nice and kept my mind off of it.

Earlier this year, however, I tried to leave my husband. Our relationship had been deteriorating for a long time and he began treating me very poorly. I ended up failing to support myself on my own, though, and after 3 months of homelessness I came back.

His family had soured to me long before I left (for complicated and problematic reasons), and him refusing to defend me to them was actually the straw that broke the camel's back. I was ripped into by his sister for having a panic attack at her wedding shower, and when I asked him to say something to help me he said that he ""would never choose me over his family"".

Things here are... Complicated. I don't know where we stand, if things will change, or anything. All I know is that for now I depend on him letting me live here. Obviously, I'm not expecting to be invited to Christmas. I wasn't invited to Thanksgiving, and he spent it with his family.

What can I do on Christmas day to not get sucked into a depressive spiral? When I was all alone on Thanksgiving, I felt so worthless and miserable. I don't have any friends I'm close enough to to spend a holiday with, so it will just be me by myself again.

295,yes,Enneagram,2022-12-11 04:06:44,serromani,I just realized that the niche topic that I feel like I need to master before I can begin living my life is... Myself.,"I'm a 5w4 sx/so.

I've been reading *The Wisdom of the Enneagram* for the first time, and I just had possibly the most significant realization in my journey with the enneagram.

The part that made it click was when the authors discuss 5s who get stuck in ""preparation mode"", refusing to actually move forward and engage in life because they feel they don't yet have mastery of their chosen field-- and without that mastery, they feel they won't be able to survive the real world.

I've never completely jived with the concept of needing to have complete mastery over one particular domain, despite relating deeply to everything else about being a 5. But after reading their take on this phenomenon, it dawned on me that the domain I have been obsessively studying and attempting to understand to the fullest extent possible is *myself.*

I have autism, ADHD, and a tremendous amount of trauma that has resulted in C-PTSD and dissociative issues. I did not know any of this about myself until a couple of years ago, at age 26, when I burned out and was sent for a neuropsychological evaluation. Since then, I have completely withdrawn from the world. I have not been able to consistently hold down a job, all of my relationships fell apart, and I rarely even leave my home anymore.

I finally understand what has been holding me back from any attempt to reconnect: I feel as though I do not understand myself and my own brain enough to navigate the world without accruing further trauma. Instead I stay at home and research psychology and neurobiology, diving deeper into specific areas of autism/ADHD/trauma research to uncover whatever information I can to just figure out *how to handle being me.*

I don't really know what to do with this realization. On the one hand, it's good to finally be aware of what has me feeling so unbelievably stuck. On the other, I can't think of how I can ever possibly move past this. I don't feel safe operating outside of my understanding, and when the thing I don't understand is *myself* there is no escaping that sense of unsafety.

I'm not sure exactly what I'm hoping to get out of this post, but as I have no one else to share this revelation with I felt it may be productive to put it here.

Interacting with others is not only draining to me, it can also feel like navigating a minefield when it's so incredibly easy for wires to get crossed and misunderstandings to arise (seemingly) out of nowhere. I feel like the conclusion that engaging with others takes more energy than it's often worth is, frankly, a pretty logical and realistic one for me personally.

I struggle a lot with the idea that, as 5s, our growth path is supposed to include ""learning that we will not be depleted by others"", when that is in fact quite a reality for me. Too much socialization will always leave me feeling spent, and a huge part of my growth as a person has in fact been a process of learning to put up *more* boundaries to ensure that I'm not completely sucked dry. I'm sure there are many neurotypical 5s out there who could make adjustments to their thinking and lifestyle in such a way that they wouldn't need to worry about becoming overwhelmed by others, but I don't know whether or not that is something that I can achieve as an autistic person.

307,yes,AutismInWomen,2022-12-02 17:30:12,serromani,It's so distressing being back in what used to be my home. [Vent],"Sorry for this vent, I just needed to let it out somewhere where I feel like people might understand why it's so hard.

My relationship with my husband became pretty toxic and unhealthy over the past couple of years, especially after I was diagnosed with autism and stated trying to unmask. In August of this year, I tried to leave and strike out on my own. First I was accepted to a DV shelter, but the shared environment was so overwhelming that I quickly left. I spent the next 3 months living out of my car and various cheap hotel rooms trying to get on my feet.

Unfortunately, I failed, and I had to move back in with my spouse. Our relationship is very complicated still, but he's trying to support me in the ways he can and I'm at least grateful to have an actual address again. 

But while I was gone, he apparently decided to take ALL of my things and just dump them haphazardly into spare rooms we never go in. This is a huge 3-bedroom, 3-bathroom home (completely his idea, completely in his name), and it's already a toxic dump because he has ADHD and depression and hasn't cleaned a thing since we moved in 3 years ago. Now, almost every single item I own is buried in a giant pile in a little room where the door is kept closed.

I can't find anything, and just looking at my whole life swept up and tossed away is so overwhelming and depressing that I rarely try. I rotate wearing just the clothes I've kept with me in my car because it sucks so much to rummage through everything to find something to wear. All of my books, my journals, my crafting supplies, my favorite stuffed animals... All laying in a glorified landfill with the door shut to hide them from view.

It's so hard readjusting to being back here. This place was never all that great for me, but it was the closest thing to a home that I've ever had. Now it's just a dirty, empty shell. I'm grateful to get to sleep in the same place every night again, but it can be so depressing and so incredibly overwhelming at times. I just want to cry.

That's all, I just needed to get this out there. Thank you for reading this far if you did.

308,yes,askatherapist,2022-12-02 16:23:44,serromani,Is it okay to express anger in front of other people when they are not the cause?,"I grew up in an abusive home and have C-PTSD, so I feel like my opinion of this may be skewed.

My spouse gets angry or frustrated fairly often, and I always know about it since he doesn't really try to hide it. He'll sigh loudly, sort of slam things around a bit, mutter curse words, and if I try to talk to him when he's in this mood he'll be very short with me.

My mother did (does) all of this as well, albeit to a much more extreme extent. It was how I could tell I needed to stay away-- once she was angry about something, it would escalate like this until she was throwing things, screaming, and lashing out at anyone who came near.

Perhaps because of the environment I grew up in, I developed the idea that anger is an emotion that should be carefully controlled as much as possible. When I'm angry, I do my best not to express it to or around anyone else unless there is very good reason. I thought this was normal and healthy. However, my spouse has said that he has a right to express how he feels, and he shouldn't have to feel bad for feeling frustrated. He actually hates when I am sad or anxious (it makes him react angrily), and when we have argued in the past about it I have said much the same thing about my emotions (that I shouldn't have to feel bad for having them).

So, I was wondering if there really is any difference between expressing sadness or anxiety (such as by having a sad expression, crying, or communicating a worry) and expressing frustration or anger. I feel as though acting angry can be scary and damaging to others, which is why I feel it's something to work out privately when at all possible, but my spouse clearly has a negative reaction to other emotions-- so is either one of us really ""wrong"" or ""right"" to express these things in front of the other?",2,4,4,0.75,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='zaqe88')>,,/r/askatherapist/comments/zaqe88/is_it_okay_to_express_anger_in_front_of_other/,,,False

I was so relieved to be able to finally escape my AGAB that I didn't care that it still wasn't 100% accurate. The rest of the world thinks in binaries, so I played along for my own comfort and safety.

Only recently, I've been missing expressing my femininity so much. I miss makeup, flowy clothes, and bright colors. But every time I tried to experiment, I would immediately get she/her'd, and that just hurt too much. So I shut down that side of me.

More than any of that, though, I missed being comfortable in my skin. I've always had dysphoria, but trying so hard to pass as male just made it worse. I started packing for the sake of passing, and it just made me feel weird. I didn't like having a bulge in my pants any more than I like having two bulges on my chest. I don't want to have to add characteristics of a different sex, I just want to lose the ones I have from my AGAB.

All of this has just made me realize how much neither binary gender really fits me. Being seen as a guy is only euphoric in the sense that I feel like I accomplished some great espionage-- it doesn't make me feel any more seen than being viewed as a woman. It's less uncomfortable, sure, but it's not me.

I want so badly to escape gender altogether. All I've ever wanted is to just be *me*, to be recognized and known by others as the person I am, and not some cardboard cutout of whatever preconceived conceptions they have about me based on where I do and don't bulge. These ideas of gender are too restrictive for me, because I am so much more than either of them.

Recently, I've started passing in certain contexts, and there are people in my life who only know me as a guy who they assume is cis and straight. This is pretty cool in a lot of ways, but I've been very conscious of the fact that what I do and say is seen through a very different lens now.

I miss complimenting women so much! I know that probably sounds weird, but I used to just live for those little moments of connection when I would tell someone her outfit is totally banging and she'd light up in smiles. Nowadays if I were to try to tell a girl she completely nailed her makeup, it would most likely come off as trying to hit on her and might make her uncomfortable.

Is it better just to keep my mouth shut, or maybe only give compliments that aren't based on anything to do with physical appearance? I'm more than happy to give those of course, but when you're just interacting with someone briefly it can be hard to work that into the conversation, haha. It used to be so easy to give people a quick cheer up by commenting on her shoes or something.

Just curious if any of y'all have come up with a solution for this, or if I should just try harder to keep my well-intentioned thoughts to myself. 😅

ETA: I don't know if this needs clarifying but I will just in case: I am not actually trying to hit on anyone, haha.

All I know is that last night I had a flashback to how I felt in the final months-year of things with my husband, and if I'm flashing back to it that means it has to have hurt me, right?

Things were complicated. He never meant to hurt me, but he don't listen to me when I begged him to understand. He was pretty unkind to me for being autistic, having CPTSD, and being trans/NB (after I came out), but never overtly. He was just sort of quietly ashamed of me and would only say the really negative things when confronted.

He also had (has) 100% control of the finances and wouldn't give it up. I was out of work for a couple of years from a bad relapse/burnout, and I never got access to any bank accounts or credit cards. I had to ask him directly for any money and he would decide if I could have it. Sometimes he would say no, even for things like groceries that I needed, and I'd go hungry.

But also he says he loves me and he supports me more than anyone else ever has in my life. He pays for things I need a lot of the time if I can't. He comforts me the best he can when I'm overwhelmed. I'm so confused because sometimes he acts like we have a future together, but I know we don't. His family turned on me and he already told me months ago he would never choose me over them or even say anything to them for mistreating me.

I'm just very confused and disoriented. He is nicer to me than anyone else but also can be very unintentionally cruel.

342,yes,raisedbynarcissists,2022-09-01 15:49:34,SakuraNightGlow,Vent About My Mom and My Thoughts On What To Do,"So, I'm 19 and have lived with my nmom ever since. I think I'm just going to let out everything I feel about her and what I remember.
So this woman was apparently supposed to be a child psychologist, she studied 2 years of it yet she acts nothing like a decently compassionate and caring parent. She's both emotionally and physically abused me my entire life, instances I don't remember that she for some reason told me and others I can never forget.
When I was a baby, I was pretty chatty according to my family. And I guess I was too chatty for my mom. Because one day she said she got so annoyed with my talking that she punched me hard enough to break my nose. I don't know how that wasn't an instant indicator you weren't ready to raise another human being if you can't even prevent yourself from breaking your baby's nose but alright :) From what I remember she also said she lied about how my nose got broken because idk who would just let that slide.
And then I got older. For the most part she was okay until I started to become more shy and reserved. She always thought something was wrong with me and still does for my sudden change in personality. But by that point she was already becoming abusive and only reason why I assume she did is because of my shift in personality. I was also ""lucky"" enough to be her golden child, I always got amazing grades and behaved well in school and I still do my best to keep that up now just because I'm so used to it. But through that came all the screaming and degrading if I got any grade lower than an A. I've always hated when this woman told me ""Always aim to do your best. If you can get a 90, go for a 95 next time! And next time get 100!"" No. That's nearly impossible please shut up.
But back to her thinking something was wrong with me because I started becoming shy. She took it upon herself to enlist me in school therapy. And that was the worst mistake she could have done and it's what made me realize she was abusing me. I was casually talking to my therapist about some stuff that happens at home and remarked certain things she's done. Like yelling at me, degrading me, throwing objects at me including cleaning liquids. My therapist reasonably got nervous and calls CPS. I got nervous since knowing eventually they would come and told my mom. And my god this woman put on a damn show because she started crying, asking me why I did this to her and if I hate her. Man was I so unaware of what she's done to me it makes me furious now, and she used that to her advantage before. The social worker sadly found nothing wrong. After that, my mom went from being so sad I did this to damning me to hell. She thought I called the social worker, and claimed something like that stays on your record (I really hope it does now) and she told my entire family how I called CPS on her and thank goodness they weren't around that often by then because then it would have gone worse. But sadly I know how that would have gone now.
But I was devastated and this is really where her abuse began to shine towards me.
She immediately took me out of therapy, started to continuously talk me down and make me feel miserable on purpose, and physically abused me constantly. I remember her lifting a chair, about to throw it onto me before I screamed and begged her to leave me alone, but before that she was screaming and yelling at me and my dad was in the same room and did NOTHING until that moment. Which he always does, nothing. And all he did was just tell her to calm down. Same with an instance of her literally choking me, which she did 3 times in total in my life, and my dad was around for 2 of those times and again. Nothing. I had to push her off every single time and lock myself in my room. So yeah, lovely middle school experience. Made my anxiety form and skyrocket and I would have panic attacks every time I thought she'd hurt me.
She then placed me in therapy with a therapist who always took her side. I forgot how I stopped attending that therapy but good fucking riddance I hate that therapist. And then I was placed in therapy to a place closer to our new apartment. Both my therapists there were lovely. Yet the first one had to go. Because she too called CPS after I told her about the second time my mom tried to choke me which was some days before my session, and how my dad did nothing and just told this she beast to relax, as if that's going to do anything. And that time I was hysterical, begging my therapist to not call and I didn't want to go home after she made the call. I was too scared because the last time this happened I got horribly abused. And the same happened. Except this time, my family was strung along. Constantly demanding to talk to me. Constant accusing and belittling from nearly everyone, saying I deserve to feel horrible for what I apparently did because I guess I made the call and wasn't horrified for my life at the thought that I was going to be in a living hell for the next months? All of this for confiding in someone that she fucking choked me, and I'm told I'm the bad guy. Best example is one of my half siblings from my dad's side (because he's left multiple families) and said half sibling comparing her situation to mine, talking up my mom and how great of a parent she is. Even went through my phone to find something?? Idk what because all I do is talk to the little friends I have in there. I tried going to sleep to just constantly hear her ask if I'm still awake and I thought she was going to try understanding me but every time, she would use that to continue to talk shit about me and how horrible and stupid I am. Thanks so much for making my anxiety flare at hearing the words you used to describe me, now I never spoke to you since. So yeah, therapists changed and I regret leaving my most recent one. I loved her a lot and she was very sweet and comforting to me. My mom hated her because she made me feel safe but eventually she has no say in taking me out of therapy because I was an adult and I got to chose when to leave. And leaving therapy was my decision because I was finally getting better. But now it's getting bad again. Since then my mom broke one of my fingers, choked me AGAIN and in front of my sister this time who was paralyzed in fear. I actually had to claw at my mom because pushing her off wasn't enough and she took A PICTURE saying *I* abused her and that she could take me to court for that?? I deleted the picture of course but the audacity she has to physically assault me, I defend myself, and she says I hurt her. And then the most recent things that happened.
She was off on vacation to DR. And it was those times where she was nicest to me. When I was nowhere near her. And then when I came over for my vacation, which I could barely call one because I was busy with college transferring issues and so much emailing and video calls half of the time. Right before we went to a resort my dad was fighting with my sister and then he all of a sudden wanted to include me in it. I got angry and then my mom comes in the room asking me why I'm yelling across the hall to him and I simply said ""You constantly yell at me when we live in an apartment complex where vents are connected to other apartments. People always hear you screaming. But we're in a house, who's going to hear me screaming?"" And she shut up thankfully. Oh yeah and she also mentioned how me and my sister have been ruining our vacation when that was literally the first time we ever ""acted out""? Okay then. And then the day we left back to our city.
An uncle came over and was going to leave as I was just waking up. I was really tired and trying to wake myself up and my mom took that as being rude I guess because after he left she said ""Don't worry, I know how much you hate it here. You're never coming back."" And I got just fed up by that point. I came into her room and was constantly asking her why does she hate me so much? Why does she always assume the worst of me? Why does she think a normal person can simply change their demeanors in a flash like her two faced self?? She just kept telling me I'm insane and crazy and odious, her favorite word to call me. Then eventually I said ""This is why we can never be on the same page. You assume the worst of me and all I do is try and try to fix our relationship as mother and daughter. That therapist you took me to, thinking those kids who bullied me were the problem? Yeah remember she told you, YOU need to get your act together and stop making me feel like shit! What is your problem with me?!"" ""How's about you just stop trying to 'fix' things, because I will never understand you.""
After that, it was the first time I wondered why I was born and thought that if I didn't have friends who cared about me, there would be no reason for me to go on. And I cried. A lot.
And after I calmed down I just decided you know what. Fine.
I'm not talking to her anymore unless I need to bring something up. I'm not going to say hi to her or wish her good night. I'm going to ignore her everytime she's in my room. I can't stand caring about her opinion because if I keep doing that to myself, I'm actually going to kill myself.
But things are going to get better.
Because the university I transferred to is 3/4 hours away from this toxic household. I know I'll be so much happier next semester.
As for my sister, at first I felt guilty leaving her behind. But she's clearly the favorite in both my parents eyes, but especially my mom's. Because she never laid a hand on her. There have been times my dad has hurt me too. But never my sister. I'm not jealous of her, we're very close, as close as siblings could be, as I had to be her emotional and well, parental support because none of our actual parents wanted to do their jobs outside of paying bills and putting food on the table. But at least I don't have to worry about her getting abused while I'm away because it's me my parents want.
I can't wait to move away. And I'm also glad I won't be going back to my parents home country. When it's brought up I'll just say ""No no, remember mom. I 'hated being there'. I 'hate my family and everything around me'. I'm 'odious'. You made it clear and you know what, you're right. I have to focus on my studies in my own country. Reguardless, I don't want to go to a place where my own family would hate me reguardless. If they knew my morals and who I love, they would hate me as much as you hate me and never want to speak to me again. So I'm good, I'd rather stay in a country with people that actually enjoy my company and people who actually want me around. Go have your vacation! :D""
So yeah, this is very long but I had to let this out somewhere since I may not have time for a therapist with my college workload sadly. Or I could look into a counselor from my campus that can do virtual sessions, idk.
Anyways thanks if you read this far. Let me know what you think and if I should do anything else besides ignoring my ""parents"".
From this point forward they're not considered my parents, they're just a woman and man who I have to bare with sharing a living place until I move out.",1,1,1,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='x3b1s6')>,,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/x3b1s6/vent_about_my_mom_and_my_thoughts_on_what_to_do/,,,False

344,yes,raisedbynarcissists,2022-07-07 01:40:25,SakuraNightGlow,I wish there was a rule to not call CPS if a child is begging you not to.,"This may sound very weird to some people but hopefully most can agree with me; So I have narcissistic and abusive parents. Specifically my mother is the abuser and my dad watched the abuse happen and did nothing to help me and in fact sides with her a couple of times and even did put his hands on me a couple of times.
But basically, CPS has been called to my house twice. Twice, nothing was done. And twice, I was horrendously abused for it and nowadays, there are still moments here and there when it happens. My mom always loves to bring those incidents up about how I ""betrayed her"" as though she didn't do what she's done to me and told my entire family and made them all hate me.
For that, I wish my therapists NEVER called CPS on my household. After those two incidents, they were the worst moments of my life and lowest.
The second time they were called, I was begging to not go home and even tried to call other family members to have me stay over at their place.
In all honesty, if a child is literally begging you not to call CPS, trust me, it's seriously better not to. Not only does CPS barely do anything in most cases, because my mother and most parents in these cases are manipulative, of course they'd get away with what they've done, but in the many cases where no child is taken out of the home, they will be in hell for a good, long while and it will make their situation far, far worse.
Literally the only time that won't happen is if there was a very blown out of proportion misunderstanding and the parents are actually kind and understanding.
This was just a random rant but I hope some people can agree with me on this, because both these instances really riled up my anxiety and made me realize the hard way that my family does not care about me in the slightest.",1,2,2,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='vt6kjc')>,,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/vt6kjc/i_wish_there_was_a_rule_to_not_call_cps_if_a/,,,False

I (38f) was diagnosed with ADHD in 2021 at the age of 35. Since I got medicated, I have absolutely spiralled. I think that the ADHD was masking something deeper. I think I’m autistic. I’ve been looking through old photos, and remembering things - meltdown, shutdowns. 

I literally found a photo of myself on prom night doing t-Rex arms and looking like I had learned to smile from watching other people.

I remember my dad telling me not to smile in photos because I used to look like a clown when I smiled. I was terrible at friendship, still am, and I have never been able to manage well on my own.

My hands seem a little weak, and I’m dropping things, tripping over things, and generally experiencing Tasmanian devil levels of chaos.

———————

I was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 37 in August 2021. I started on 20 mg of Elvanse in November 2021, titrating up to 50 mg in early December. The medication was like magic! I suddenly became capable, even masterful, at the things I had struggled with. The Elvanse what is supplemented with Amfexa, dexamphetamine sulphate, to deal with the afternoon drop-off.

I could manage my money, remember to brush my teeth every day, keep a tidy home, and had a quiet mind. 

In April 2022, I had Covid. Following the illness, my Elvanse stopped working. I regressed to pre-medication ADHD. This led to a breakdown in September 2022, and blood tests revealed that I had a deficiency of vitamin d. I was also suffering with muscle and joint pain.

I have been taking vitamin D for nearly 2 months now, and 10 days ago. I finally sorted out my titration and increased my Elvanse dosage to 60 mg. The first day on the increased dosage was difficult, I was very rapid. I do feel like I’ve levelled out now and things are becoming easier again, however, my hands seem to be clumsier than ever. Today alone, I have managed to spill grease on the floor from my breakfast, drop a bunch of empty cat food tins on the floor, and trip over bag that I was emptying, literally seconds before.

Has anybody else experienced these types of side effects, when increasing the dosage of Elvanse or other stimulants?

I am reluctant to change to a different medication, as I’ve had so much success with Elvanse, especially when I first started taking it.

For full disclosure, I am also using melatonin as a sleep aid, and the occasional cannabis laced edible for the joint pain. I’m also on citalopram ,omeprazole, and codeine.

I know that this is a lot, and it might not be the Elvanse, that’s causing issues, but they do seem to have got worse since I increase my dose.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I've had an ADHD diagnosis for nearly a year, but almost every day my behaviour leads to me considering that I might actually be autistic. I think I'm on the edges of the DSM-5 criteria, but as an AFAB person (cis woman, pronouns she/her) nothing was every picked up in childhood.

[From The History of the World I Guess on YouTube](https://preview.redd.it/pedhk3j7ohc91.png?width=943&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7b06b936c2dbed3201894abd5658746bedd9a8c4)

I grew up with gut problems (IBS) and always struggled to regulate my emotions. Dad always told me not to smile in photos because I'd do this weird unnatural grin. Struggled to make friends in childhood and had birthday parties where nobody turned up (always put it down to having a summer birthday).

I was always exhausted from masking and I had occasional meltdowns at school when it got too much (somebody threw a can at my head and I screamed at them, someone slagged off my mum and I chased him around the classroom). I was bullied, not physically but psychologically - although now I think I just didn't understand ""the rules"".

In my late teens I remember some pretty bad tantrums when the schedule changed.

Went to uni at 18 and really really struggled. Was regularly taken advantage of and lost money to so-called ""friends"". Drank my weight in booze and ended up with more gut problems (hiatal hernia) which bother me to this day.

Couldn't bear to part with any of my belongings and so lugged 20 years of stuff from home to uni and back again for 3 years.

Aggressively bullied in adulthood because the social rules eluded me. Had some therapy and dealt with my abandonment issues and came to terms with the fact that my parents aren't perfect.

Met the woman of my dreams, married her, and she puts up with my nonsense. I'm not easy to live with.

Black and white thinking and fairness is a huge cornerstone in my life. This has caused me a lot of discomfort at work and with friendships. I'm like a dog with a bone if I think something isn't fair.

Now in my dream job as a data analyst (not a diagnosis, but come one - data analysis?!?)

Started looking into neurodivergence and resisted looking into autism because \*ableism\*. Got my ADHD diagnosis last year and it changed my life.

Fast-forward to today and the heat wave.

For context, my 73-yo MIL has COPD and lives in a very hot area. She is coping fine and isn't too bothred about the heat.

Woman at work, heavily pregnant, in discomfort, but coping and not complaining.

Me... 37, feel like my stomach is cooking me from the inside out and I've had diarrhea for 24 hours despite drinking lots of water and eating plenty. Feel weak and shaky despite staying out of the sun. Staying hydrated, but headache is constant. Brain is like soup.

Mood is awful. I'm grumpy and struggling so much to regulate my feelings. The bodily discomfort is killing me. I've been on the  verge of tears for the past 24 hours.

I'm on stimulants, anti-depressants and omeprazole, none of which appears to effective in the heat.

I'm all over the place and my tummy is playing up.

370,yes,cats,2022-06-20 18:48:54,thefrustratedpoet,Feral Fawcett update - TW/ sad news,"Feral made it through her spaying surgery today, but we’ve had some bad news. Feral tested positive for FIV. We’re not able to keep her because she’s a risk to our two cats. 

We are absolutely heartbroken, as you can imagine. Feral is the sweetest and most affectionate cat. 

I had worried about it when we brought her into the house in February, but the vet wasn’t worried, probably because she didn’t behave like a street cat at all. She was cuddly and cute and gentle. 

Since she had her kittens she’s been losing weight, but we just put it down to nursing, and she’s had a bad stomach every couple of weeks, which we put down to her being in heat, or at worst, IBD. But it’s FIV. We have to rehome her as soon as we can, either to a rescue centre, or to a household that where she is the only cat, or where she is with other FIV cats. 

She will have to be a house cat, or live in a house with a completely enclosed garden so that she can’t infect other cats.

I feel so lost and devastated. We love her so much, and were making plans for after recovery and rehoming of the kittens. She was going to be our cat. But now that’s not possible.

I fell in love with her the day we brought her in and she looked up at me with big thankful eyes.

I know we’ve given her a happy home these past 6 months, she’s had the best food, veterinary care and love as we nurses her back to health and through her pregnancy and we also took good care of her before then in the garden. We’ve known her for a year.

There’s a good chance that the kittens aren’t FIV positive, but we won’t know until they are 5-6 months old and can be tested. That’s still 3 or 4 months away, but the risk is low. But one of the adopters can’t take the risk because of their existing cat, and the other adopter is making some tough choices tonight.

This has been the hardest day. And it will only get harder.",1,6,6,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='vgsq32')>,,/r/cats/comments/vgsq32/feral_fawcett_update_tw_sad_news/,,,False

[Feral and her 3 babies](https://preview.redd.it/i1grikcobq591.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3e58413d01683aa57ea393e7c95902effb9d6f2a)

Feral has been poorly again the past few days and the vet has suggested that she may have Inflammatory Bowel Disease. We're also preparing for the rehoming of her babies, and I'm so worried about what the stress will do to her. We've started separating her from the kittens for mealtimes to give her a break (they are a LOT).

I'd like some advice on the future... we have 2 cats who were settled into a routine foodwise, and eat specific food. Their routine has been spoiled since we brought Feral into the house in February, and we're still not able to spay her (4 weeks depending on her tummy), so she's in the house all the time.

I've never had a cat with additional needs before, and it's hard. A lot of cleaning up and chasing Feral away from food, as well as kitten wrangling ([kittens](https://www.reddit.com/r/kittens/comments/vcnx7e/8_weeks_old_and_just_going_to_be_so_hard_to_rehome/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) are all fine and gorgeous).

We are prepared, to be in it for the long haul - we think she was abandoned by her previous owner (she's still a juvenile and was living in our back garden last summer) because of her digestive issues. We think this because she knew how to use a litter box when we took her in and she is a loving and sweet cat who's behaviour suggests she once had a home.

I just need to know whether a cat with IBD can live with other cats successfully, or whether she needs to be the only cat in the house. I hope it's the former, because honestly, Feral Fawcett is the sweetest cat, still a kitten really, and I want to give her the happy forever home she deserves. But I also want what is best for her, and if that means rehoming, I'll have to deal with that...",1,2,2,0.76,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='vco2ah')>,,/r/cats/comments/vco2ah/update_on_feral_fawcett/,,,False

Our gorgeous rescue kitty, Feral Fawcett, has been with us for nearly 6 months. She gave birth 7 weeks ago to 3 beautiful kittens and is just a wonderful mother. We're feeding her 4 times per day, the recommended amount of adult cat food each day, enriched with some kitten food, PLUS she's eating the babies' leftovers. She's only nursing for comfort now, and the kittens are 90% weaned onto kitten food, but Feral is ALWAYS hungry, as soon as she''s finished eating, she bugs us for food all the time. She's always trying to sneak into the kitchen and jump on the counters trying to find food.

We can't leave kibble down for grazing as she is very allergic to every kind we've tried (I'm talking poo-mageddon whenever she has biscuits or treats), even wheat-free, gluten-free, pro-biotic enriched. We've got her on Royal Canin Gastrointestinal adult cat food, mixed with Lily's Adult pate (as the kittens have Lily's too). We actually think she had a home before we found her, but that she might have been abandoned because she had constant diarrhoea and made lots of messes in the house. 

She's been treated for Giardia and her tummy is much better, but she's still always hungry. We're worried about overfeeding and making her sick. Should we just feed her whenever she asks?

TIA 

PS - Yes, we have taken her to the vet multiple times for her tummy issues, but we'd like to try and address this particular issue at home before we take her again.",6,3,3,0.72,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='v4o531')>,,/r/cats/comments/v4o531/always_hungry/,,,False

(Sorry this long…) Before Elvanse (Vyvanse) I will we a big eater. I’d eat all day and night, snacking on crisps, chocolate, whatever was in the house. I know now that eating was a dopamine seeking exercise.

Since November when I started on my medication, that behaviour has stopped, but my body still isn’t sending the “you’re hungry, eat” signals. 

When I don’t eat, I get mean. I’m moody, I’m disoriented and confused, in short, I feel awful…

I can’t get into the habit of eating breakfast (or any other meal really). Every meal I eat is a conscious choice. I can sometimes remember to make a smoothie for breakfast, and a sandwich for lunch if my wife is at home with me.

Today is Saturday. Weekends are already a struggle because I wake up several hours before her and so it’s usually 11 or 12 before I eat. But today was a disaster. I had 2 events, morning and afternoon, for which I had to be in drag. So I was up early early early to get ready. And I didn’t have time to eat… then a quick change and off to my afternoon event. I felt absolutely terrible, I knew it was because I needed to eat, but I still didn’t. 

I finally ate at around 1pm, and instantly felt a little better, but the damage was done. I snapped at my wife, I almost crashed my car… this cannot continue.

487,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-05-26 15:00:04,blushvibe,30/M autistic/ADHD partner fixates on cat fur?,"Hi there! I’m really happy I found this community, and I’m wondering if someone can shed some light on a question my partner and I have had for a while now. 

My fiancé is 30, and a late diagnosis for both autism and ADHD. When he was around college age, his parents got their first pet cats for the family. He’d had experience with animals before, of course, but these were his first “pets” and thus the first animals to really spend time with him in a way other people could observe. 

They noticed he was intently fixated on their cats’ fur and would politely point it out to him (without telling him to “stop”—they were pretty gentle with him) but he couldn’t stop for more than a little bit. The physical act is difficult to explain, but almost every time he’s around our black cat, he “inspects” her fur intently through staring, and moving small bits of her fur around to see down to her skin, or to maybe see underside of her coat? Almost like the way monkeys clean each other, but he’s not picking anything off of her? 

It doesn’t hurt our cat at all, and is totally harmless, but he does it a lot, and when he does, it’s really hard to break him out of it. He asked me to just gently nudge his hand out of the way when I see him doing it while we’re all family cuddling together, but he goes right back to it immediately. I’ve nudged him like 5-10 times in a row consistently, and it hasn’t helped. 

He doesn’t know why he does it, and it came on very very late in life, as you can see. He does stim with his own hair a lot (curling the front piece around his finger near his forehead)  and likes to rub one spot for a long period of time (when he’s holding me, he’ll move his thumb back and forth rapidly on my skin—this is sometimes painful for me) so he’s very tactile. 

We’re both at a loss for an explanation and are wondering if anyone else has experienced this in their partner, or does it themselves? Maybe someone can shed some light on this for us? 

Appreciate the read! Thanks!",16,3,3,0.64,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13sfinq')>,,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/13sfinq/30m_autisticadhd_partner_fixates_on_cat_fur/,,,False
488,yes,Instagram,2021-12-06 23:54:52,blushvibe,Revert to old story UI?,"Hey there! About a week or two ago, I noticed the UI for posting photos to my story, and saving the photo I took via the IG camera, had changed. Friends still seem to have the old UI, and I'm really really not a fan of this new one. (Side note: I really just use the in-app camera when I'm taking photos through the effect of my choice \[as if I were to add the photo to my story\] and immediately saving to my camera roll after.) In order for me to save a photo I've taken with the in-app story camera, I have to click on three little dots in the top left of the screen, then click ""Save"" from the dropdown that appears. (I've included a photo below!)

Does anyone know if there's any way at all to revert back to the previous UI? The one that allowed you to tap the save icon immediately without going through a second set of clicks? I apologize if this has been asked before! I've been googling like crazy and I can't seem to find an answer. 

Running 15.1 on an iPhone 11 Pro Max, latest version of IG.

My ring finger size is a 7-7.5. The top ring in this photo (sterling silver) is a 5.75, and the gold ring below it (14k gold fill) is a 6.75. 

Could either of these rings be sized up by a jeweler to a 7 or 7.5? I was reading online and I saw a few conflicting things: rings can only be made a half size larger; rings can be made much larger, but not if they have thin bands, etc. and I'm completely lost. Any help from some artisans would be much appreciated!

However, when she falls ill, it takes an emotional toll on me to provide her with the necessary care and support, and I struggle to maintain my composure. It feels overwhelming, and I often need a day or two to recover from the exhaustion and stress. To cope, I sometimes pretend that her illness doesn't bother me, even though it really does.

As her health has worsened over the years, I've struggled to reciprocate the level of care she's given me, and I feel like there's no one else I can turn to for help. My family members are not supportive, and losing my mom is a painful thought. Even though she understands my limitations, I sometimes feel like my struggles are dismissed as excuses to protect her from emotional stress.

When my mom fell sick a few months ago with what could have been covid, it was the worst it had ever been for me emotionally. She was wailing through the night as she had sharp crushing chest pain and didn't want to go to the hospital. I found myself punching my pillows and bruskly placing extra pillows under her legs to alleviate the pain. She was understandably affected to all of this to the point where we even stopped talking for a week. It was especially difficult because it happened on the anniversary of her hospitalization due to a terrible job situation. I was emotionally depleted, and it was a huge relief when she finally turned the corner a few days later when a family acquaintance gave her some anti viral medicine. However, the emotional distress still hadn't tappered off and I couldn't convey my relief.

My mom has not only been my emotional support but has also helped me financially. However, because of years of therapy and her being my full-time caregiver, we have not been able to set aside money for the future. This has become a concern as her health continues to decline, and she worries about who will take care of her if something happens to her.

I find it challenging to express my emotions to others in real life and to find trustworthy individuals who can listen without judgment. Reddits my only safe haven as it's easier to bottle everything up than risk being exposed to harmful or misconstrued ideas from others. 

Slightly off topic, I don't think I could ever have a family of my own because mothers aren't cut any slack from running away from distressing situations.",4,5,5,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='11yc7i8')>,,/r/AutismInWomen/comments/11yc7i8/dae_struggle_to_take_care_of_a_loved_one/,,,False

Despite my pickiness, I always seem to end up with the wrong person. My past experiences with men have been less than ideal, ranging from dealing with a guy in high school who threatened my single mom via text message to being involved with an alcoholic in college. I even got involved with a military man who had a thing for women with a certain body type and tried to replace me with someone who fit that description. Unfortunately, my father, who has Asperger's and PTSD, was emotionally abusive and absent throughout my childhood, leaving me with no positive male role models.

To heal from my past experiences, I've interacted with men online since I was 16. I approach these interactions with the understanding that not everyone is looking for a long-term commitment. While these interactions have helped close some of the wounds my father left, they ultimately lead to disappointment.

Physically, I am drawn to men who prioritize fitness and have a masculine build. I'm willing to be flexible on certain physical attributes like height and build, but I wouldn't consider pursuing someone who appears too skinny or significantly shorter than I am. The men in my family don't embody society's standards of physical attractiveness, so I feel pressure to find someone who does.

I admit that I have internalized feelings of being ostracized due to not fitting conventional beauty standards and being bullied for it. I'm mixed but haven't dated within either of my ethnicities because I don't fully identify with either. My perception of everyone else from those cultures has been influenced by emotional scars from both sides of my family.

Recently, I met a guy while he was traveling who seemed perfect - financially stable and independent. We had a brief but intimate relationship that gradually fizzled out. He went MIA for three weeks, only to claim he has a ""new"" interest and give me the option to remain friends or end things. I didn't message him immediately although an anonymous account messaged me to tell me that he had a girlfriend back home who he cheated on. This encounter with this dude showed me the importance of independence and financial stability in a partner. The men in my family aren't financially savvy and my past experiences involved guys who were content with just getting by.

My past experiences with men have been less than ideal, ranging from dealing with a guy in high school who threatened my single mom via text message to being involved with an alcoholic in college. I even got involved with a military man who had a thing for women with a certain body type and tried to replace me with someone who fit that description. Unfortunately, my father, who has Asperger's and PTSD, was emotionally abusive and absent throughout my childhood, leaving me with no positive male role models.

To heal from my past experiences, I've interacted with men online since I was 16. I approach these interactions with the understanding that not everyone is looking for a long-term commitment. While these interactions have helped close some of the wounds my father left, they ultimately lead to disappointment.

Physically, I am drawn to men who prioritize fitness and have a masculine build. I'm willing to be flexible on certain physical attributes like height and build, but I wouldn't consider pursuing someone who appears too skinny or significantly shorter than I am. The men in my family don't embody society's standards of physical attractiveness, so I feel pressure to find someone who does.

I admit that I have internalized feelings of being ostracized due to not fitting conventional beauty standards and being bullied for it. I'm mixed but haven't dated within either of my ethnicities because I don't fully identify with either. My perception of everyone else from those cultures has been influenced by emotional scars from both sides of my family.

Recently, I met a guy while he was traveling who seemed perfect - financially stable and independent. We had a brief but intimate relationship that gradually fizzled out. He went MIA for three weeks, only to claim he has a ""new"" interest and give me the option to remain friends or end things. I didn't message him immediately although an anonymous account messaged me to tell me that he had a girlfriend back home who he cheated on.

Over time, I've made small but sustainable changes to my diet to help manage my health. I don't neglect my personal hygiene and my intimate areas definitely aren't an exception.

TLDR; ND (neurodiverse) and NT (neurotypical) widening gap with people my age and younger catching up, struggles with female friendships, mean girl, social bullying

I 27F identify as ND (neurodiverse). 

I'm approaching my thirties, and despite having gone through many hard-learned life lessons, the divide between me and my neurotypical peers has grown increasingly painful. It seems that those my age and younger are catching up and surpassing me, which leaves me feeling inadequate. I have always had trouble making female friends, particularly in middle and high school where girls form exclusive cliques and can be quite entitled and judgmental towards those they deem ""less desirable"" and lower on the social ladder. 

Even today and a decade later, the mere thought of them makes my blood boil, as if they had occurred just yesterday. I sometimes wish I had physically harmed those who belittled me, even if it meant being expelled, which in hindsight I could have easily moved past. I am uncertain what it is about me that causes people to treat me in such a condescending manner, but it cuts me to the core. When I attempt to retaliate, they fail to grasp the severity of their actions or shift the blame on me, to the extent of accusing me of being a bully. 

I've learned in many painful ways that women tend to approach social bullying with a more calculated, long-term strategy, as opposed to instant gratification. The dynamics of the situation are open to interpretation, and I struggle to find the words to articulate and paint a picture to people as someone on the receiving end of this behavior. I often second-guess myself and have a distorted perception of the situation, especially when my intuition tells me that I am being guilt-tripped or gaslit.

Unfortunately, these experiences have left me with emotional scars that I still carry with me today. I find myself struggling to identify and pushing away kind, trustworthy, empathetic, and reliable people out of a fear that their kindness is too good to be true. I just know there are people out there who are just this insidious and ingenious so that they can guilt trip you on those token acts of kindness that they perceive as being taken for granted. This defense mechanism has held me back from forming meaningful relationships with women. 

I believe that my relationship with my emotionally uninvolved father also played a role in my struggle to form close female relationships. As a neurodiverse woman, I tend to communicate more effectively with neurotypical men because their direct and explicit communication style is more compatible with mine. I also felt like a part of me was subconsciously finding ways to compensate for consistent and positive male presence which was why I find myself ""willing"" to put in more effort with male peers. Although of course there's those asking for a punch in the face, their games to be thrown out the window, a jail sentence and having an egg cracked on their head.

There have been a couple of vivid incidents where my inability to regulate my emotions and lack of self-awareness have caused problems in my friendships. 

For example, I turned down an invitation to a weekday ladies' night from a friend (lets call her Penny) who was possibly landing a full job at a media agency she interned at for a few months. I struggled to celebrate her accomplishments without feeling waves of resentment and discouragement, which made me feel guilty. I gave Penny some context to why I had my reservations (don't remember what I said exactly, along the lines of experiencing a lot of family issues which held be back in life). She thanked me for opening up and also explained that it was ""easier"" for the company to keep her and ease her into the role than hire someone more qualified but on LOWER pay. We didn't know each other for long at that point although she told me in her exact words that she liked me enough as a friend to want me to be part of her achievement. A part of me felt guilty for being quick to make a snap judgment based on what was expressed externally.

Another example was when an ex-friend, *Serena changed her Facebook profile picture of her law degree graduation photo. I couldn't bring myself to congratulate her because of my own struggles with internships, post-college preparation, blurred boundaries with family, and being in a new country. Our friendship started when I got involved with a guy from our rival school whom I met on Tumblr.  It was a very gradual build-up of him unvieling his true colors although I'll spare the details of that for now. I experienced conflicting emotions in my friendship with *Serena as once we pursued our respective degrees, we formed our own groups of friends and found that the people in our new circles shared more similarities with each of us individually than we ever did as a pair. While she taught me the value of genuine friendship, she started avoiding me as our goals and personalities diverged. I also know at the back of her mind that part of it was her not feeling supported as much as she was supportive of me.

As I get older, it becomes harder to justify my inability to regulate my emotions and lack of self-awareness, which can come across as uncaring and insensitive. I know that society expects women to possess maturity, empathy, emotional intelligence, and social awareness, but as someone with a different neurotype, I struggle to meet these expectations.

I have the worst sensory overload with my grandmother's family, her included because everyone talks over each other's heads, rambles, monologs. It was especially worse this time round as my cousin welcomed a new member during the pandemic and everyone made the worst baby induced voices around the kid. I don't have anything  against kids and babies in general but not their high-pitched voices and screams.

I brought a large knife from my grandparent's home and placed it on the table while (relunctantly) visiting them as an attempt to shock everyone into silence. When I pretended to be surprised like everyone else, my mom mouthed to me, ""Did you bring the knife?"" I resorted to silencing everyone because I felt it was the only way to regain my composure and stabilize myself. Since there were many people around, I couldn't do anything more drastic, such as slamming the knife against the table. I wish I did, or at least got someone injured.

Like most ND folk, my needs were never met by the people who didn't take the time to understand. I tend to cope with violence out of fear of my own safety.

654,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-02-22 07:26:40,East_Midnight2812,does anyone struggle to care for their loved ones,"My Moms been my rock and on this asd journey with me. When she falls ill, it can be challenging to provide the necessary care and support she needs. The emotional toll can be overwhelming as feels as if everything is falling apart. It can take a day or two to recover from the exhaustion and stress.

My mom is the glue holding everything together. When she's ill, I struggle to maintain my composure while looking after her . To cope, I adopted a vacant and unaffected demeanor to avoid exacerbating the situation. I had to prioritize my sanity and mental well-being, even if it meant slamming a door and taking time out to recharge.

The role reversal was unsettling, as I struggled to reciprocate the level of care I get from her. There is no one to turn to as my ""family"" had their heads in the sand, and losing my Mom is a painful thought. Despite her understanding of my limitations, I sometimes feel like my struggles are dismissed as excuses. It was especially hard when I was in middle and high school, and didn't yet understand my own psychology. I was even made to skip school to care for her, and it was a difficult situation to navigate. We don't have a third person who's equipped to handle the situation and to alleviate some of the stress. 

A few months ago, my mom fell sick and was bedridden, and it was the worst it had been for me emotionally. I found myself punching pillows, and things got so bad that we were not on speaking terms for a week. Part of it was because it was the anniversary of her being admitted to the hospital due to a nightmare situation. I was so depleted and could not express my relief when she turned the corner a few days later.

My Mom has been the individual's biggest support all my life, both financially and emotionally. However, due to years of therapy and being my full-time caregiver, I have not been able to set aside money for the long term. Her health had deteriorated for several years, and she had been diagnosed with two autoimmune conditions, which made her think about who could take over even more if something to happen to them prematurely.

I find it difficult to express my feelings in real life and identify trustworthy people who can hold the space for me to do so. I've turned to Reddit to vent and retain my anonymity. I typically bottle everything up, as it's easier than risking being subjected to people's harmful and misconstrued ideas.",3,8,8,0.91,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='118rxkm')>,,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/118rxkm/does_anyone_struggle_to_care_for_their_loved_ones/,,,False

She doesn't expect people to understand, much less NTs with an exception of a few. However, I'm sensitive to these perceptions that people form and I see it from their POV.

She had my passwords to my social media while I was in middle school as kids were fucking ruthless and I didn't even recognize it. Fair enough that I was under 18 but that didn't need to carry over to adulthood. Within the last few years, she has tried to be my social media manager helping with content creation, video editing and all that which she is learning since the height of the pandemic. It's really difficult to be to be on board with her because it gets to a point where she feels she can control and maneuver the direction that she wants. She's been my rock and been more involved than anyone's parents I know although being closer to 30, I feel quite ""infantiziled"" having her involved in my career etc as an adult because it feels like I'm robbed off the opportunity to stand on my own two feet.

I also didn't recognized being bullied by people in the workplace who honestly deserve to be abused back.

I was on tinder passport within the 2020-2021 period when it was free. I was jumping from different countries across different in geographical regions swiping on people. Even though the possibility of meeting in person was pretty slim, it still didn't stop us from like talking to each other and making a part of my routine. I had a lot of flirtatious exchanges and shared some intimate pictures with a few depending on the dynamics and being the best judge of whether they've ""earned"" that right. There were a few I had a connection with and when my mom took over my social media and I had to clear out all my DMs. I would have dug my own grave if she saw our exchanges because that's violating someone's privacy. I could have created a separate account but I couldn't be bothered to move everyone on there. 

I'm very adamant of safe guarding those exchanges with the men I've met online. She doesn't need to be involved in my dating life and know about that side of me especially if God forbids she's got access to my social media. She understandably feels strongly about hook up culture and the psychological damage it does. I sometimes post raunchy pics on my close friends stories because why tf not and hid her from my main.

So I decided to still have her as a follower but block her from my stories as I don't always need her to decode. Also why would I want her to see those kinds of pictures of me? I'm an adult woman and I've got the right to embrace my own sexuality.

Something that I haven't fully addressed within myself is that I have years of wounds and scars to heal from my dad who has aspergers, ptsd and emotionally abusive from a difficult childhood being out of my life. I feel like the only way to do that is by splitting my attention across multiple interactions with men online is to heal years of scars that he's left.

658,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-02-01 12:42:39,East_Midnight2812,Any neurodiverse business owners here?,"Edited as wanted to remove some identifying factors. TLDR 26F formally diagnosed with ASD when I was a toddler. Life has been pretty rough since leaving college as I had difficulty finding long-term employment and expect to do so. Is anyone here running their own business? How has your journey been as far as finding your own version of success?

I currently run an online business. I wanted to create my own business to take control of my financial future and break my family's intergenerational curse of financial trauma and instability. I knew it would be a challenging endeavor, especially since I had and expect to have difficulty finding long-term employment. Although a small part of me feels rewarded, taking this small step pushing through a lot of ambiguity and uncertainty and not having any help. Working remotely and/or in a hybrid set up is the most compatible with the structure (rather a lackthereof) of my daily routine, which allows me to conserve my social battery and function at my most optimal. Basically it's a whole paradox- there's the ""stability"" of the 9-5 along with the regular income and structure that comes with it yet falling short of skills ""traditionally"" valued in the working world such as resourcefulness, effective multitasking and prioritizing and inter-personal relationship skills. 

For context, I burnt out during what was meant to be a 6 month post college corporate internship, which was abruptly cut to 3. To this day, I still haven't received a concrete explanation as there wasn't a formal internship program in place which I believe could have benefitted me and wouldn't have completely been thrown into the deep end. It could have been because I went into this from another country in a mentally terrible place which significantly hindered my executive functioning and ability to multitask was depleting at the speed of light. 

I was also lulled into an MLM at the peak of the global pandemic- the ""agency"" was marketed as a place ""empowering"" single mothers, stay at home mothers and fresh graduates alike to ""earn"" a viable living. I eventually got a ""comission"" based project only on what was my last month at this hell hole of an ""agency"". I was told the amount but didn't stop to think how it would have been split amongst 4 team members coming home with a 3 figure pittance. I was also told that there would not be ""pay"" during the probation period. Eventually, I transferred it back to them. This male client whose social media my team members and I were managing got into legal trouble and covered on all local media outlets. To throw into the mix, this toxic narcissitc ""agency""  ""owner"" who could have been sleeping with him didn't give a rat's ass about how this could have jeopardized the agency, my coworkers and my own future employment prospects. 

So that said, I have a lot of career trauma when it comes to navigating working relationships, standing up for myself and nasty people who deserve to be abused back.",7,16,16,0.94,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='10qtsdr')>,,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/10qtsdr/any_neurodiverse_business_owners_here/,,,False

660,yes,confessions,2023-01-31 14:43:25,East_Midnight2812,26F almost got caught in the middle of a relationship,"So recently I found myself taking a good look at my track record. I also took a quiz and learnt that my relationship traits align the most closely to an anxious attachment style. 

The men in my family are awful- emotionally uninvolved, unreliable, narcissitic, patriarchal, chauvinistic, misogynistic, I could go on. It's a generational curse that I know I should break yet history repeats itself in all shapes and forms. I've learnt the hard way that you can't help someone who doesn't realize they need help. My Dad s*xually a***** my Mom as well.

Ironically, I tend to gravitate towards men who are essentially cut from the same cloth. I do have an ideal type with a bit of room for flexibility as far as height and physique goes. I admit I've internalized a lot of ostracizm from what wasn't ""conventionally"" desirable growing up and being bullied for that. It all started when I was talking to guys on tumblr when I was around 15/16 outside of the country I live. It was where I met the first dude I got into a situationship with that was purely on looks. I also didn't have a very stable identity growing up which was how I ended up in a lot of chaotic situations with people. 

It all starts with the typical love bombing at the start and then looking for new supply afterwards. Some took longer than others to unveil their true colors. I would typically have it worse as once we got intimate I would be attached.

I've had a few encounters who weren't ""desirable"" and felt ""safer"" to be around. They seemed to have their heads screwed on properly, mentally stable, almost the opposite of what I've experienced based on my first impression. My guard was always up and I was simultaneously on an alert for any deal breakers which happened in due course. I could never carry myself with the same enthusiasm and charisma I had with those other dudes who just weren't healthy. A couple of them asked why I was so closed off- I told them I take a while to warm up although I'm sure they suspected there was more than that. I generally know when people aren't interested and experience it myself. 

I was talking to this dude I met while he was traveling for just over a month. He was the full package and able to stand on his own two feet financially. I was just go for dudes coasting through life and been thinking more about financial stability recently. What drew me into him was that theres a decent height difference (im 5'8.5"", he's 6'1"") and there was that masculine protection that I've never experienced before which got me all fuzzy inside. Being on the bigger side and not having the luxury to assume anyone would carry you home after having too many drinks, he offered to do that and was able to pick me up. We shared an interest in boxing and fitness, and clicked right away. We were able to keep up with each other's banter that night and that continued over time. I felt like my prayers were being answered. We were intimate and affectionate towards each other even though it didn't occur to us in the moment that we may never see each other again. That spark quickly dwindled while he was on the road, especially once he returned to his home country. I was fine with us not talking everyday as it was a sign for me to focus on other aspects of my life. Although I noticed he would mostly text during the day and basically vanish at night. I haven't heard from him in a while so I thought I'd be a friend and reach out. Turns out he was supposedly busy with work and had a ""new interest"". He gave me the option to be friends or end it. I restricted him as I didn't wanna be desperate by replying the moment I got the message. I left it for a couple of days by which time he already unfollowed and removed me. I saw he followed a few girls while he was traveling- I admit it did kinda get to me. 

At first I wanted to commend him for being straightforward even though that's the least someone should do in a situation like that. I did feel conflicted as I felt like I wouldn't have known if I didn't message him. I got a message from an anonymous account the following day that he has a girlfriend back home who he cheated on. I didn't respond, although when it involves infidelity, that was when I decided to have a look at her profile myself. I also wonder if she may have subconsciously found out herself and wanted to get creative. The account sent screenshots of the exchange they had with the girl, and she said that she confronted him along with that particular post where they first learnt about their relationship. I noticed his followers and following was dropping so I suspected that this individual had gone through the trouble of messaging those women he met on the road individually.",0,1,1,0.67,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='10q0s7m')>,,/r/confessions/comments/10q0s7m/26f_almost_got_caught_in_the_middle_of_a/,,,False

I've got a lot of trauma around money and I felt like my prayers were being answered. We were intimate and affectionate towards each other even though it didn't occur to us in the moment that we may never see each other again. That spark quickly dwindled while he was on the road, especially once he returned to his home country. I admit it did kinda get to me especially when I saw he was following other girls on the road and updated his tinder profile.

I was fine with us not talking everyday as it was a sign for me to focus on other aspects of my life. I haven't heard from him in a while so I thought I'd be a friend and reach out. Turns out he was supposedly busy with work and had a ""new interest"". He gave me the option to be friends or end it. I restricted him as I didn't wanna be desperate by replying the moment I got the message. I left it for a couple of days by which time he already unfollowed and removed me.

664,yes,AnxiousAttachment,2023-01-25 07:40:26,East_Midnight2812,Any tips on moving from an anxious to a secure attachment style,"So recently I found myself taking a good look at my track record. I also took a quiz and learnt that my relationship traits align the most closely to an anxious attachment style. 

The men in my family are awful- emotionally uninvolved, unreliable, narcissitic, patriarchal, chauvinistic, misogynistic, I could go on. It's a generational curse that I know I should break yet history repeats itself in all shapes and forms. I've learnt the hard way that you can't help someone who doesn't realize they need help. My Dad s*xually a***** my Mom as well.

Ironically, I tend to gravitate towards who are essentially cut from the same cloth. I do have an ideal type with a bit of room for flexibility as far as height and physique goes. I admit I've internalized a lot of ostracizm from not being ""conventionally"" desirable growing up and being bullied for that. It all started when I was talking to guys on tumblr when I was around 15/16 outside of the country I live. It was where I met the first dude I got into a situationship with that was purely on looks. I also didn't have a very stable identity growing up which was how I ended up in a lot of chaotic situations with people. 

It all starts with the typical love bombing at the start and then looking for new supply afterwards. Some took longer than others to unveil their true colors. I would typically have it worse as once we got intimate I would be attached.

I've had a few encounters who weren't ""desirable"" and felt ""safer"" to be around. They seemed to have their heads screwed on properly, mentally stable, almost the opposite of what I've experienced based on my first impression. My guard was always up and I was simultaneously on an alert for any deal breakers which happened in due course. I could never carry myself with the same enthusiasm and charisma I had with those other dudes who just weren't healthy. A couple of them asked why I was so closed off- I told them I take a while to warm up although I'm sure they suspected there was more than that. I generally know when people aren't interested and experience it myself.

665,yes,tinderstories,2022-11-10 00:31:35,East_Midnight2812,I'm done with short ugly guys,"It was back in 2021 and tinder passport was still a thing. I set my location to *Vegas and was swiping like crazy. Basically enjoying the lil dopamine boosts that came with being matched. I swiped on some less ""attractive"" dudes and decided to make the first move. We exchanged socials and continued. He was responsive but would give me a heads up when he wasn't gonna have his phone with him because of the nature of his job. 

We video chatted and exchanged memes  although I didn't get butterflies talking to him. Just a dude who I vibe with- nothing more nothing less. He was more smitten by me than I was with him although he didn't seem to mind. Being a relatively open minded person, I decided to go at my own pace, put my foot down when I needed to and eventually grow onto him. The first month he wanted to send me flowers since he had developed feelings for me. I turned it down as it was too soon. Part of me was even more weirded out by the timing. He didn't push and left it as it was. 

Six months later he even asked me to be his girlfriend. I shared my reservations from past infidelity issues being in another LDR that had a big enough impact on the way I saw people since we had not met in person. He kept pressing me to think about it by saying that this is normal for people to be in LDRs w/o meeting IRL right away, after filling him on almost everything about my past history with men. I stood my ground and had a seemingly civilized conversation. After that we kept talking as usual and I wasn't once inclined to pull back.

I wasn't my most positive self the night before the VERY last video chat with him before I cut him off cold turkey. The following morning, I woke up to multiple missed calls, question marks over text and 😢 emojis. I got pretty irritated by the sight of that and didn't speak to him the whole day. 

I reluctantly decided to video chat that evening after ANOTHER stream of ""no talk? 😢"" and question marks. There's a fine line between attentiveness, annoyance and clinginess and he's the worst case of the latter two combined. *Martin told me that he got an erection while talking to me right after we ended the call. He tried to cushion the delivery with multiple 😅 and 🥺 emojis which honestly made me even more repulsed. As mentioned before I wasn't on the same page and didn't have those urges. Nor do I think any shallowness got the better of me. I told him how I felt and he tried to back paddle. To sum up his response he said that he gots urges from being attracted to me and to forget about it if I felt uncomfortable. I wasn't going to let this slide and decided to pull back a little. I also considered cutting him off but sat on my decision for a bit. Two days later he copy and pasted the same message and sent it to all my socials saying ""why are you acting distant????"". 

I was on Instagram one day and a couple of profiles that *Martin was following on my suggestions. One of them was private although she was completely naked, sitting down contorting her body while propping herself up with her arms pushing her chest up. There were heart emojis on her n*pples to bypass the censorship. The other chick had 90% ass pics, eyelash extentions that were made by some poor innocent tarantula that got killed for it, and an onlyfans. She was a self-proclaimed ""dancer"" which we all know is an euphanism for a stripper. 

I immediately took screenshots and confronted him. To sum up his response he said he doesn't use Instagram and would stop it along with following people all together if that's what I ""wanted"". I wasn't gonna settle for that non-apology and kept a distance for a few hours which then extended for almost half a day. He kept incessantly texting me on every medium we had each other on and even demanded my location. I went out with a friend for drinks that same night. We shared pictures taken on the night on our socials without a care in the world until the worst happened. *Martin incessantly DMed my friend *Leanne to get through to me. I was more pissed off on her behalf since this was something to be dealt between us to and not drag anyone else into this mess. 

His responses got more demeaning that I instantly knew that this was the final straw. As half expected the blame was thrown at me with his responses ""guess you're mad"" and ""what do you want me to say? I'm sorry"". On the day I was ready to cut him off ALL my socials, the last few messages were of him pleading me to talk and not end it with multiple 🥺 and 😢 emojis. 

Honestly he's ugly af, basically the type of guy who thinks the world owes him anything once an attractive woman gives him her time and day. Half a year later, I skimmed through his following on a burner account- he's following a bunch of women whose raunchy pics makes me want to throw up. All of them aren't even following him back nor is he even a blib in their existence. 

As someone in my mid twenties, I've seen people reach their prime sooner than others and let themselves go once their misinformed decisions catch up to them. I'm never overlooking someone's appearance ever again. Lesson learned. 

I hope that if I ever see *Martin in person that I'll be affectionate with whoever I'm seeing/dating etc so that he gets emotionally shot in the heart and punched in the stomach.",6,0,0,0.43,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='yr0f6j')>,,/r/tinderstories/comments/yr0f6j/im_done_with_short_ugly_guys/,,,False
666,yes,tinderstories,2022-11-09 06:11:13,East_Midnight2812,A tinder date that turned into a pregnancy scare.,"I met a *US marine on tinder who was stopping by for the weekend. *Derreck just arrived the night before so it was pretty spontaneous. He told me upfront that he wanted to take me out and was the most responsive out of all the other matches I had that day. He just had selfies so I wasn't sure what to expect based off that. 

He asked if I wanted to go back to his hotel room on tinder before we met up in person. I absentmindedly agreed even though I told myself I have the right to change my mind at anytime. 

We hugged once we saw each other and I felt physically protected. Turned out he had the type of physique that I naturally gravitate towards- tall and on the bigger side. Not completely ripped but it doesn't matter. I'm within the 5'7""-5'9"" range and slim thicc so it's biological. 

After meeting up for a drink, we went back to *Dereck's hotel and had s*x. There was a bit of f***play and fondling at first although it wasn't as long as it should have been. He gave the best ass slaps and put me in all sorts of positions I've never been in before. I tensed up as he's a big guy with a big package and libido to match. Him being on top pressing against my stomach put pressure on my bladder. I also had a giant starbucks before we met so I was doing everything in my power to not let any sort of flatulence kill the mood, me being haunted by this for life and *Derreck dealing with the aftermass of a tinder date going wrong. After we were done, he asked he if his godzilla sized p*nis in his exact words scared me. I've had s*x with guys who were mostly small and/or couldn't be f*cked to make it a pleasureable experience. 

Vibes were kinda dry the following day although I messaged him first to ask how he was. We had a cordial exchange despite him being at an event. He confessed to feeling really horny after the first time and wanted a quicky. I was in town and supposed to meet another tinder match who flaked. After waiting alone like an idiot with crowds and all that for a good half hour, I jumped into a cab to his hotel after I treated myself to a couple of drinks to take my mind off it. It was better in some ways although very rushed. This time I sounded like I was being tortured for dear life. Someone even knocked and *Dereck came to the door. They claimed to have gotten the wrong room although I sensed their suspicions in the air while hiding behind the partition. He walked me down and gave each other a very cordial hug once my taxi came. Not even a quick peck on the lips. He stayed in a luxury chain hotel and now I won't be able to see this particular branch the same way 😆 

Things took a turn for the worst the morning after the last quicky. I experienced intermittent nauseousness and bloating throughout the whole day. Part of it could have been a hangover from hell as I went out for two days of social drinks over the weekend for the first time in ages- my body couldn't handle the alcohol intake it did when I was in my early 20s. I was apprehensive and panic striken as it was something I've never experienced before. I knew not to gaslight myself and vigilantly watched for any unusual signs throughout the day. I eventually decided to order some birth control pills that I could only get my hands on once I had a Dr's online appointment. To throw into the mix of this madness, *Derreck unmatched. Before all that happened, I contemplated on messaging him first and eventually decided not to. He removed his bio and only kept one photo as he understandably wouldn't have been able to match and meet anyone on deployment. We didn't exchange any socials although I don't know if that would have stopped him from cutting me off completely. A part of me thinks that there was a whole lot of *marines that weekend and unbeknownst to me he thought I could have met up with his friend. 

I have proven to be naive in the past to the extent of putting myself in danger. This has got to be the most painfully silent battles I've fought internally. I'm willing to deal with any potentially drastic hormonal fluctuations over a positive pregnancy test anyday. The night before the doctors virtual appointment I was experiencing waves of guilt, discard, dehumanization and shame. It was the first time I took ages to sleep and switch off the negativity. 

I felt like history was repeating itself as I had unprotected sex the first time with a guy I met on tumblr in high school. Since we met in the morning, I instinctively got my hands on birth control and pregnancy tests on the way to a volunteer session. I had a bit of an excuse then but not this time round. 

I feel like I should have some birth control on hand incase of the one occasion where my arousal goes through the roof. Last night I put a finger up the 🐱 as I had this weird gaping feeling down there and turned out I wasn't as tight which I feel a bit unsettled about. Even though the times I've had sex were few and far inbetween I don't think it'll ever go back to what it was before. 

There's been some talk with my Mom about having co-ownership of both of our bank accounts incase of any unforseen circumstances since we only have each other. She's tech savvy and the internet has been an extension of her since its beginnings. The website of the bank we both use has a very user friendly UI and I'm dreading the thought of her eventually finding out about this from my transactions. She's the type of person who'll ask all the questions she needs to paint the full picture, even if we get into  a heated argument.

Most of what we bought was food I liked and I payed for a good chunck of it. (He gives me grocery money along with the rent to make it easier to pay for things).

Last week I was hungry and seen that he hadn't eaten the last of the ramen that I'd left for him and we hadn't gone to the store yet  so I decided that I'd make and eat that for my dinner, thinking I would just buy more whenever he decided he wanted that kind of ramen again, considering I found a store much closer to us thay sells that same ramen. Today after work, we came home and asks where the ramen we got from the store a while back was at and I told him I ate the last of it because it'd been nearly 2 months and he hadn't touched it and I didn't think he was going to eat it. He got upset and has decided not to eat anything. I tried offering other things we had in the kitchen or going to the store to buy the ramen or something else and he refused both options.

This week has been kind of crappy for him and he can't eat dairy at the moment because he's taking a smoking break and lactose makes him sick. We have other non dairy foods in the house.

I was talking to my bf on lunch and the topic of kids came up when I had watched a video of this toddler escaping their crib and turn to my bf and tell him that I would like to refrain from bedframes until our kid is like kindergarten age. He tells me that he wouldn't want that and that they could escape and get hurt, so I wanted to tell him my reasons. I say that if everything is put together right (i.e. baby proof the room, including the knobs to a certain point) they shouldn't get hurt and or even really leave the room.

688,yes,TrueOffMyChest,2022-06-23 14:58:59,SpicyRamen5193,My parents probably think I'm an unloving near failure of a kid,"I (19F) haven't said 'I love you' very often since about middle school and have a minimal relationship with my parents that I won't get too into here. I used to be an amazing student who would get A's and B's in school. I struggled mentally but I still made it. High school hit and my grades began to drop a bit. I wasn't entirely concerned but my parents were, moreso over my grades than why the grades fell; I think they assume I was lazy, which I won't deny, I was to a degree. Around junior year I met a guy (23M) online and we hit it off. Everything was fine up until mistakes were made and our relationship turned sour, which also had an impact on my mental health. I will dive more into that relationship with the guy more in another post that I'd like to write. My grades began to fall due to this toxic relationship and my parents were angry. I was dating an older guy online who still lived with his parents, my grades had tanked, and I did nothing other than what I was required to do (go to school and go to work). Then covid hit and everything just increasingly got worse. Some days I would eat nothing and do nothing. I would watch anime instead of work on school. I had no energy to really do anything. My parents tried multiple times and different ways to separate me from my now ex because they knew some of my struggle was because of him, but I found ways around that. Everything just got worse and worse and it really divided me and my parents. I hated that they hated my then bf and pulled myself away from them. Fast forward to January 2021, I have decided to go to therapy because I believed I was a problem to everyone. My then bf breaks up with me because he can't handle the massive depression and insecurities he's caused me. I in turn want to commit as I felt I had nothing else to live for, he and the toxic relationship we had was all that kept me going at that point. My parents slowly figure this out and try to support me, but they don't understand that therapy isn't going to fix me immediately. I couldn't handle all the regular stressors of life and I especially couldn't handle my parents constantly nitpicking my therapist and my school work when I just wanted to die. So I moved out for a month to my friend's house across the street. This really broke my mom because I didn't tell them all what happened leading up to this, as I wasn't ready and I was still extremely angry at what they said and did while I was in this relationship. I feel very bad that I left my mom feeling like this was their fault and I regret not telling them but I plan to. My friend was my shoulder to cry on during this period and really helped stand my ground while I was going through all of this. I slowly got better and was able to pull my grades up by my bootstraps just enough to graduate. Now, I'd talked to my parents about the plan after I graduated and I was told that I would have a place to stay until I could get back on my feet mentally and financially. They at least understood that I was not ok mentally, until they didn't. After I graduated in May and moved back in, they had told me that I had until July to figure out a place to live and a job to support it. I was dumbfounded, not only had they gone back on their word but I would not have the same luxury as my 3 siblings of being able to save money and learn good spending habits before going out on my own. I felt blindsided. Luckily they told me they'd give me my mom's old car for transport if I graduated and my dad ended up allowing me to move into one of his rental properties and be one of his tenants. Still, these were big steps for me to take after being extremely depressed for god knows how long.

About a year has passed and I'm doing ok mentally and I'm in a much healthier relationship with my current bf (22M) and we are living together. He's a smoker and sometimes I feel like my parents judge me for the type of people I end up falling for. We make just enough to make ends meet but neither of us will likely pursue higher education or, at least at the moment, make much more than what we are now, especially with inflation taking over. I am the least successful out of all their children and I don't know if I will ever make more than any of them.

TLDR: I got into a toxic relationship, got the big sad, grades tanked, parents offered help and then revoked it, but now I'm better in a healthier relationship with a smoker, but really only living paycheck to paycheck while my siblings are much more successful than me and I feel like my parents are disappointed in me because of all that.

P.S. Don't tell me that I'm still young and can change my life around, I've heard it too many times and with inflation, it might actually be impossible to do very much. I am also trying to make amends with my parents.",0,0,0,0.5,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='viyvyf')>,,/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/viyvyf/my_parents_probably_think_im_an_unloving_near/,,,False

All I want are possibilities to why I thought this way.

As a young child (elementary age), I would have intrusive thoughts of harming animals for fun, myself out of anger, or others just because I happened to be holding something dangerous. If my parents sent me to my room for sneaking extra screen time, I'd break down in anger and frustration and idealize hanging myself from my fan or in my closet. If I was in class with a pair of scissors, I would imagine what would happen if I stabbed my classmates with them. I've never done anything serious, the worst thing was probably neglect/violent torture of a fish and hamster respectively.

It went from those thoughts to suicidal and homicidal thoughts primarily in middle school. I got mad at my parents for taking my DS? I would think through a murder plan and visualize it but never went through with it. I constantly wanted to kms constantly and visualize just how much happier everyone would be or how better off everyone would be if i just never existed.

I have since become in control of these thoughts and my emotions, and I know many of these were caused by depression, anxiety, adoption trauma, and a bit of bullying. I'm just wondering if there was anything I could be missing from my past that could've contributed to what i thought and felt.

p.s. I took a great interest in gore videos and animal abuse videos in late elementary and middle school.

728,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-05-26 03:29:57,Scout1769,I Firmly believe I have ASD. Any advice for a guy just learning about the spectrum at 29?,"My entire life I’ve always been, different. Growing up, kids and even adults would see me in a very unique light but would always dismiss it as “silly little quirks” or “that’s just how he is”. I was diagnosed with ADHD around 1st grade and I took Adderall until 2012. I never really considered anything more but something was/has always been…off about me and  my social understanding never matched even the other individuals that had ADHD. 

Where do I start? I find it impossible to control the volume of my voice, I don’t know (still) when to talk in turn without accidentally interrupting. If someone explains something one way and I explain the exact same thing but from my vantage no one knows what I’m talking about. Loud sudden noises (like fireworks and gunfire give me anxiety). I have to do thing in a certain order and it makes me angry if things get out of whack. I seem to talk normal in my head and writing/typing but I struggle to talk to others and I am amazed if a conversation goes remotely well despite rehearsing it in my head over and over. Eye contact makes me uncomfortable. People think I’m being mean or rude when I feel like I’m completely neutral or even friendly. I repeat myself a lot, and even edited this post because I kept repeating myself. When confronted, yelled at, or even anxious or overwhelmed I have bad verbal shutdowns, where I just panic in my head but on the outside I’m just blankly staring or looking down. There is so much more. 

I recently found a paper from kindergarten regarding transitioning into first grade and the observations about me that the teacher and nurse at the school had made that year executed by the guidance counselor, nurse, and a doctor they had come in the school each year (this was 1999 in a little backwoods country school). It examined basic physical, linguistic, and cognitive functions at that age. I was 5-6 at the time. I had a hard time speaking and I remember that part, they had me in a 1 on 1 language class with the guidance counselor. At the bottom of the paper was additional notes that read:

“Speech Language -Diagnostic
We highly recommend special classes for **** 

Observations:
 **** shows high potential for PDD-NOS & ADHD. We advise you as the parent/guardian of **** that he sees his pediatrician before the new school year. 
*There is more to the note but there is an old stain that made some if it illegible.”

From my understanding PDD-NOS was an old diagnostic criteria for Autism before it was changed to ASD. (Please correct me if I’m wrong) 

My entire life my parents never told me, nor did they pursue it with the pediatrician or any of my doctors. I struggled all the way through school and barely graduated in normal classes when I should have been in special ed…it was brushed off as ADHD because my mom always did the talking at the doctors and I was only allowed to say what she coached me to say, and now I know why…I guess she just couldn’t accept the fact her son had a learning disability. 

*side note I grew up in a wealthy but abusive household as an adopted only child. 

I’m married now and still struggle everyday with the same things I always have but it is way different as an adult.
There is so much more to my story but too way much for Reddit, I’m also physically disabled as icing on the cake so I’ve thought about starting an instagram or a YouTube channel to help spread awareness but I don’t know if it would catch on. If anyone has any advice on getting an official diagnosis and how to better understand and cope with this new discovery please let me know.

We gave him my old iPhone X at the start of the year so he could join in with other kids at school. We also gave him a pair of really good ($100) pair of wireless headphones. We spent more on the headphones because they have good noise cancelling, which he uses a fair bit when he is overwhelmed. He also uses the phone a lot to listen to music when he is out of his comfort zone. Otherwise it’s used for typical teen stuff - social media, watching YouTube, chatting with friends, etc. Anyway, Max is not good with his possessions. He is always losing them and dropping them, treating them roughly etc. I think the word careless summarises it best. He has had to replace or pay for repairs on a few of his items in the last three years. He saves up his birthday/Christmas money from us and his grandparents but doesn’t have a regular job. We keep offering to give him pocket money if he will do some jobs around the house, but he refuses (he says ‘I’m too lazy’.) I won’t let him get a job outside the house until he starts doing some jobs at home, as my belief is that if he has enough time and energy to earn his own money, he has enough time and energy to help at home first. Anyway, in the last month, Max has lost his headphones at school somewhere (and they have now probably been taken by a less honest student), and this week he has dropped his phone and broken it. He doesn’t have enough money to replace/ repair them. Part of me feels that he has to learn responsibility for his items, and needs to not be bailed out when he is being careless (things we have told him repeatedly, like don’t walk down the street on your phone, not looking where you are going, but he does it anyway). But part of me recognises his neurodivergence is affecting his ability to be careful with his items. I am ADHD myself, so I often lose my phone/headphones/ wallet etc. And I accept that it is part of my brain and wouldn’t hesitate to replace my own items, even if it was a stupid mistake on my part. I forgive myself for my neurodiversity. How much should I do the same for Max, and how much should I be trying to teach him responsibility? Am I creating a spoilt teen if I pay for replacements, or am I placing unfair neurotypical expectations on a kid who is struggling with executive functioning?

756,yes,JapanTravel,2022-06-21 04:51:55,Kmama,Advice on itinerary options for two families with teens/tweens,"We are two families travelling with teens/tweens (8 of us in total) in April 2023. 
We will spend the first week in Tokyo, trying to squeeze in everyone's wish lists. Then we have two weeks to try to zip around and catch the highlights. Keeping in mind we are travelling with four teens/tweens.

Kyoto and Hiroshima (including Mayajima) are a must, we will leave about 5 days for Kyoto and 4 for Hiroshima.

Then we have approx 4 days left to choose between Osaka, Mt Fuji and stopping in Nagoya to see the new Ghibli Park.

* Is Mt Fuji worth the visit? I visited India 4 times before I saw the Taj Mahal, and while I loved the experience I don't think I was wrong skipping it for more interesting destinations the first three times. I'm wondering if Mt Fuji is like this, or if it is a Must Visit destination?
* Is there a way to squeeze in Ghibli Park without two nights in Nagoya? The park is a high priority for me and my two kids, but kind of indifferent for the other family. I would love to take my two, but feel like we're dragging 8 people off the path (and not in an exciting way) for 48 hrs just for one theme park.
* People say Osaka is the laid-back cool little sister of Tokyo. Is it a Must Visit? With 7 days already planned in Tokyo at the start (plus we fly out of Tokyo as well at the end) are we just repeating ourselves with an urban experience?
* Is there anything else we are crazy for skipping? It already feels like 3 weeks is not long enough for this trip!!!

I realise that everyone will have very different opinions about what is a ‘must visit’ in Japan. Totally cool with that. The more opinions the merrier!

*Side note - my teen is autistic and very excited about the trip, but he struggles with fast transitions, so we are trying to plan an itinerary that doesn’t move between destinations too rapidly and gives us time to explore each spot.",18,16,16,0.81,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='vh54j1')>,,/r/JapanTravel/comments/vh54j1/advice_on_itinerary_options_for_two_families_with/,,,False

I made a post in a chronically ill group about advice for staying hydrated as someone who hates water. 

I’m AuDHD and hydration has always been a struggle for me. I didn’t know it was strongly due to things like not getting hunger and thirst cues properly, things like executive dysfunction, other symptoms of AuDHD that just make care task so damn difficult to do. 

Most of the responses were great and I have tons of suggestions to consider. But one person started off their comment with “I hate to break it to you but part of being an adult is drinking water”. It felt patronizing, I have a lot of rejection feelings towards any kind of behavior people push as “normal”. Because even tasks that are necessary, just because need to do them even for my health, it doesn’t make it easy. 

They also started pushing the whole “sugar is bad” thing. And idk about anyone else, but as someone who got shoved into diet culture really young I struggle with disordered eating. And it’s important to pull away from this idea that some foods are good and some foods are bad. So I let them know this and asked them to just be more mindful, and I assumed they didn’t mean to be patronizing but it did come off that way. 

Things just escalated and it turned into them making fun of me for asking for advice but then not liking their advice. They said I was “bitching” because I wouldn’t drink water but complained about not being hydrated. They then compared me to their mother who complains to them about their weight, to which they tell her not to eat sticks of butter, and then they added their mom is always offended by this. 

They claimed to be AuDHD as well and said it didn’t stop them from “training” themselves to drink water. 

Tbh the whole situation made me cry. I’m scared to even post here that I might be antagonized by others. As someone who struggles to build connections, I just always assumed spaces like this were easier and people were always more compassionate because they can understand. This person triggered all the things I fear about my AuDHD which is that it’s not disabling, I’m just lazy and don’t want to do the work. And that I’m not willing to take help that’s offered, and that I over complicate things or I make excuses for why some things are hard. Idk. I just wanted to try venting about this, I’m not asking for advice. Just didn’t know if anyone had similar stories to commiserate over.",52,47,47,0.89,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13rxwap')>,,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/13rxwap/dealing_with_ableism_from_other_autistic_people/,,,False
806,yes,ChronicIllness,2023-05-25 20:07:09,GhostAmethyst,Tips for staying hydrated when you don’t like water?,"I struggle with AuDHD which affects my body signals for things like hunger, thirst, and even going to the bathroom. So there’s days where I can have like a single 8oz cup of something and I won’t realize until the end of the day. 

I also don’t like plain water. I find it to completely dry out my mouth, and there’s just nothing motivating about it that makes me want to drink it. If I do enjoy it, it’s ice cold water over ice. But it has to be filtered, I have terrible tasting tap water. 

I ask because I realize that my lack of hydration is probably affecting me in a lot of physical ways. Not that I think it will rid me of symptoms, but it’s possible some things I’m experiencing are exacerbated by not being hydrated enough. Mostly that I suspect I have POTS and I know fluids are really important. I mainly drink sports drinks, but sometimes I get tired of the sweetness and limited flavors I can find, but the salty taste is often very satisfying for me. I also can’t have too many carbonated beverages due to GERD. 

I also generally struggle to stretch my budget each month (for food stamps) to cover enough drinks. The last week or two weeks of the month I find myself feeling worse because I realize I’ve drank through most of what I’ve had and I can’t afford more. 

So I’m just wondering if anyone has any tips for keeping hydrated, or making drinks stretch to last.",63,26,26,0.91,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13rruko')>,,/r/ChronicIllness/comments/13rruko/tips_for_staying_hydrated_when_you_dont_like_water/,,,False
807,yes,ChronicIllness,2023-05-25 11:01:00,GhostAmethyst,Bad experiences with med prescribers?,"Curious if anyone else has had terrible run ins with psychiatrists, or their med providers, or anyone in charge of med changes?

I haven’t talked about this personally in a while, I think because it still hurts as I don’t understand why a professional would do this. But for a period of time my mental health was so bad I was cycling through really awful mental breakdowns. After a certain point I agreed with my therapist to give medications a try. So she recommended someone and I saw them pretty soon and we talked about things that were an immediate concern and what meds to try right away. 

I realize now, but never said anything then because I was trying to be like a “team player”, but it bothered me that it felt like I couldn’t express any difficulties I was having to this Dr because she would just want to throw meds at it. Like, I have a lot of combatting diagnoses, at the time we were only aware of mental health symptoms. But I felt it was reasonable some of the things I was experiencing and that they didn’t need meds. Plus I was getting every freaking side effect from every medication she prescribed. 

Fast forward, I got so tired after a year of all the side effects from meds that I decided I didn’t want to do mental health meds anymore. I was in a safer personal space and I had the ability to up my therapy and I wanted to put in more energy to that. When I told the Dr this I could tell she seemed put off. Almost offended. She still needed to see me to monitor being off meds and make sure I was okay. 

During all this I was receiving Visiting Nursing services along with my fiancé, because I also had other meds from my PCP/GP and I just, for my whole life my ADHD has always won the med fight and I’ve never been able to be consistent on meds. So a VN was a great solution, especially since my partner was already receiving the services. 

Well, this VN company was horrible, and apparently when I decided to go off mental health meds they wanted to cut me off services completely even though I had other meds to take. They wanted confirmation from my prescriber that she thought it would be beneficial for me to not have my services cut. The very next appointment I had with her I explained to her why it would negatively impact me to have my services cut, and she agreed and said she would vouch for me. 

Why, when I was already stressed and feeling helpless did she go behind my back and agree with them to cut my services? I had another follow up scheduled with her and I never showed, and she never reached out to me as she had in the past to make sure I was okay with our appointment time and such. Which makes me feel like she knew what she did was shitty, because she literally never reached out to me after that and we just never spoke again. 

Since I am disabled and unable to work, I’m stuck on my couch most days. So I actually have aligned my med taking with the times my dog has to go out to go potty, and this so far has been working for me, first time in my life. My partner also left those VN services and found a new place, new nurse, who is absolutely wonderful. Anyway, I wanted to vent in a space I feel like more people would understand.

808,yes,GriefSupport,2023-05-24 21:56:44,GhostAmethyst,When looking back means facing a loved ones difficult past.,"My grandmother passed away about 4/5 years ago now. My moms family is a bit of a complicated history, with each other, with us, with my grandmother. 

My mom and I talked today about my grandmothers past, and it makes me so angry for the way so many people I know personally, including family, have treated her. 

My grandmother grew up in Mexico and never learned to read or write. She was sent to a convent instead of a school to learn to cook and clean so she could be a “good wife”. They abused her there, and took advantage of her. My grandfather that she ended up with, he physically abused her and my mom and my uncles. His family also hit my grandmother, her own family treated her poorly. When she came here and my grandfather eventually passed, she couldn’t work. Eventually when she was able to collect social security, my mom turned to a woman in my grandmothers congregation to be her power of attorney. This woman ended up stealing so much of my grandmothers money and lying to her. My uncles would often come by and ask my grandmother to sign off blank checks (because she only learned to sign her name) and they also drained all of her money. 

My grandmother lived with us most of her life but the times that she didn’t is when everyone did these things. One time she went to live with “friends” from her congregation, and they ended up abusing her and treating her like a slave. My mom was constantly asked to leave it be and leave it in Gods hands. 

Once my mom had to make a huge move and we needed to open a storage for my grandmothers things. My uncles said they would take care of it. One of my uncles who was physically supposed to be in charge of the payments, gave the monthly payments to his girlfriends son to pay it off, and he never did. He pocketed the money and my grandmothers entire life got auctioned away. 

I’m so angry. My abuelita was the sweetest, most kind hearted and forgiving person you could meet. Her sons couldn’t even bother to visit her towards the end, and she never felt any different towards them. Never. She forgave everyone in her life who ever did wrong to her, without question. She took care of me and my brother through so much of my childhood and even a portion of my adulthood. To know her life was filled with so much pain and misfortune at the hands of awful miserable people. 

I’m not religious, but I am spiritual. I can only hope the universe hands out karma where appropriate. Because I would give everything to have her here still so I could have tried to make up for all the awful things she endured.",3,3,3,0.8,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13qz2r2')>,,/r/GriefSupport/comments/13qz2r2/when_looking_back_means_facing_a_loved_ones/,,,False
809,yes,mexicanfood,2023-05-24 19:07:15,GhostAmethyst,Question about types of Sopes.,"My family is very Americanized and I was never taught about my culture or any kind of history or to have any understanding of how varied Mexican cuisine is. I only know what dishes my mom always made, and that’s the only Mexican food I’ve ever known (and it’s not very vast). 

One thing I’ve always been curious on, is Sopes in my house was always lightly fried tortillas, covered in a type of salsa roja, topped with cheese and onion, rolled up and eaten just like that. Are these of a different name? Because when I try to research more on the dish, I can only find the Sopes made of the thick handmade tortillas topped with meats, lettuce, crema, etc. 

The only thing I know is my family was born in Mexico City, so is this just a regional difference or has my mom not been giving me the correct name of this dish 😂 Which I would fully believe because for years they made me believe that our version of tacos was what is actually taquitos or flautas. I never knew they were not actually regular tacos until I got older.

Edit** they are indeed Enchiladas, based on several descriptions and photos provided. I have a serious talk to have with my mother 😂 because I have NO clue how we got from Enchiladas to “Sopes”. She always insisted it was a regional thing but it’s clearly not lol. I may update later if I get an interesting response from her. Thank you for helping me finally get an answer after years of confusion.

Update: So this took a bit of a sad turn. My mom suspects some confusion likely came from the fact that my grandmother didn’t read or write, and was sent to a convent to learn to clean and cook. My grandmother was abused by many many family and close people throughout her life. My moms theory is that they said things to her they knew weren’t true because they knew my grandmother didn’t know better. My mom also grew up being told the enchiladas were Sopes and never questioned it. And they moved here when they were very very young so I’m not sure she was ever exposed to other peoples cooking to know to question the validity of the names. It opened up a very rough conversation but cathartic as my grandmother has not been with us for 4 years. Interesting the many ways good connects us.

814,yes,Dachshund,2023-04-14 21:24:53,GhostAmethyst,TW: Anticipatory Grief,"I just wanted somewhere to share where maybe others can understand. 

About 5 or so years ago my fiancé and I adopted this chunky little dapple mini. She was so skittish, she had a mouthful of bad teeth, you couldn’t leash her or really touch her too much. But she loved our other little mini the moment she saw him, and the shelter knew she would be okay. 

We named her Tali (short for Tali Z’orah, a video game character we love) and just watched her grow and change so amazingly. She was one of the most affectionate dogs we’d ever met. We used to joke she’d crawl into your skin if you’d let her. And she loooovveeed food. Didn’t know how to play with toys unfortunately, but being outside, being with us, and having a full belly was enough. Even after she had lose all her teeth, she was content. 

5 years isn’t long enough. They think she has a tumor somewhere in her head. We thought, we hoped she just had a really bad sinus infection. She already had some allergy problems and was just beginning to lose her eyesight like a year ago. And at a suspected age of 13 she still had SO much energy. A pain in the butt most days if I’m honest 😅 

Two months ago she started getting more intense allergy-like symptoms. Sneezing, head shaking, trouble breathing. Just more of what we normally dealt with. And then two weeks ago she started getting nose bleeds. Massive and terrifying nose bleeds. One eye was swelling, we had to hand feed her to try to minimize sneezing. A trip to the vet and they’re fairly certain it’s a tumor, and after this week so am I. 

She sleeps most of the day now. She’s pretty much lost all eyesight and we think she can’t hear well either if at all. It’s hard getting her to finish her food, and she won’t take water. She’s confused when she is awake. She walks in circles and gets “lost” in corners of our apartment. Her eye is bulging more and the other one is starting to swell. She struggles to keep them open now. It used to be one ear that bothered her and now it’s both. 

We can’t afford to test her to know for sure. And even if we did, things have happened so rapidly that even if we could afford it I don’t think it would be fair to put her through treatment. She’s on some meds to help other symptoms. We’ve been told we really just have to wait and see. 

I’ve never done this with a pet. I’m trying really hard to keep it together. My fiancé and I have had a really rough year. I don’t want to have to do this. 

*please no suggestions on treatment, I’m just here for support*

*Edit: In case anyone comes back to this, we did end up letting her go as of Tuesday afternoon 4/18/2023. She stopped wanting to eat her food, or could only eat a very small amount at a time. This interfered with her ability to take her meds which ended up leading to her feeling more pain and also it started the nose bleeds again. Day of was a big struggle, and we were disappointed thinking we couldn't get her to have a last meal, but she actually finished half a cheeseburger and some ice cream outside the vet before her appointment.

My fiancé and I are both disabled, mainly in huge part to our mental health. But these past couple months we’ve had some positive changes happening around our life and more to come. Mainly along the lines of finally being able to make a more accommodating apartment space that could potentially help us a whole lot with daily functioning. 

I know during the Winter people tend to feel depression symptoms going up. But I don’t know if it’s just that for me. Because every time I have things going on, I think about people that aren’t around in my life anymore and it just pushes me further into depression. 

My father walked out on me as a teen and I often think where he is in life and when I have things going on, what he would think of me. My grandmother passed away 4 years ago, before I had any semblance of stability and so I often wish I could share this life I’ve been building with her. I think about friends that just aren’t around. And more recently having to distance myself from the rest of my family, and so I think a lot about how I can’t share any of my life with them. For my own sanity, trust me, it’s best not to. 

I’m also neurodivergent and I struggle immensely with building relationships and making friends. So when I have a lot of changes happening, it quickly feels isolating and lonely because I genuinely don’t have anyone I can share it with. I’m part of a small community on Instagram, and a lot of my internet friends are always happy to hear what’s going on, but it’s more of passing updates. It’s never full conversations about my life or theirs. Not anymore. All the friends I used to have that used to know everything about my life, don’t want to be in my life anymore. 

Idk.

818,yes,GriefSupport,2023-01-03 07:59:17,GhostAmethyst,"It’s been about 4 years and it doesn’t hurt less, it just comes less frequently.","For the first couple years I couldn’t share a single memory of my grandmother without feeling like it would put me into a spiral. 

I struggle heavily with my mental health, to the point of being disabled. At the time she past I wasn’t seeing a therapist but once I did start seeing them I quickly understood that emotions were not a strong point of mine. 

It took me probably a whole year of therapy before I could even identify the core feelings of my grief. 

Without typing a novel, I have a lot of anger and frustration at the way my life has played out which essentially had me not having my shit together until well after she passed. I’m not religious. A bit spiritual, still figuring things out. For my life, I truly believe everything happens for a reason. And I guess that’s what makes me so mad. 

My life played out the way it did to where I’m finally where I am now. And I don’t know if I will ever wrap my head around how utterly unfair it feels that I can’t now share this part of my life with her. 

There are so many things I had wanted to do with her and I never had the time/money/stability to do them. Some times at certain moments of the year I just become so overwhelmingly aware of everything in my life I want to share with her. Or places I want to take her, things she’s always wanted to do. Maybe this is weighing on me more because over the years I’ve become very disconnected with the rest of my family.

I don’t really have a grasp on my beliefs of the afterlife. So there’s nothing comforting for me about thinking of her watching over me, or that if I speak aloud she can hear me. All I really have is to just sit here feeling everything, and it truly never hurts any less. I just don’t experience it as often.

822,yes,mentalhealth,2022-11-30 01:32:17,GhostAmethyst,Sometimes I just can’t fathom how people wake up every day when the world is so awful.,"I just want to preface this by saying I am in therapy, have been for a few years now. I’ve only really started to prioritize my mental health since I lost my job during initial pandemic. I’ve since realized I’m not fit for work, so I’ve truly dedicated my time to trying to understand myself and learn how to cope and learn what tools can be helpful for me. 

That being said, social issues are extremely important to me. I’m someone who holds a few marginalized labels, my fiancé even more so than me, and friends that I’ve made over the past few years also all come from marginalized communities. 

Most days I am just existing as best I can, doing what work I can in between therapy sessions. But sometimes I just wake up feeling an overwhelming amount of awareness of just how awful this country is. Racism, ableism, sexism/misogyny, transphobia, homophobia, Fatphobia etc the list literally goes on. Political issues that directly effect people I know. Myself being often affected by things that are going on. I’m lucky to be in a state that’s fairly progressive so there is no immediate danger, but it doesn’t make my heart hurt any less for those that are actively trying to flee their states for safety. 

Sometimes I wake up and it’s just too much. And I know there’s people out there who experience far more dangers than I do, and I just don’t understand how they find it in them to keep going. I feel it enough as is and it’s too much even on a good day. 

I’ve been feeling beat down lately. This is a huge part of it but it’s also just my own general mental health struggles. I find it so hard to keep going sometimes.

826,yes,dandruff,2022-11-04 21:22:59,GhostAmethyst,"Shaving head for the first time, how do I go about ridding the dandruff and caring for scalp?","I will give a little context for anyone who’s curious, if not you can skip down to the next paragraph! In the last couple years my dandruff and dry scalp has worsened immensely. I do struggle with my mental health, I am disabled, a lot has happened so no idea if there’s anything stress related. But about 8 months ago I noticed my hair falling out pretty bad. I struggle bad with depression so you can imagine hygiene is really tough. But I ditched all the typical store products that were not working for me and started buying products from Lush. Made small amounts of progress finally but it looked promising. Until I got hit with medical issues causing chronic pain for about 4 months and I could barely shower once a week. It just set me back immensely. I have a lot going on in trying to get on track with my health and figuring out a diagnosis for what happened, and my hair has started falling out worse again. I can’t take it anymore. It’s making my mental health worse and my hair in general has been difficult to deal with, on top of the typical symptoms of really bad dandruff and dry scalp.

So I’ve decided to just shave my head. Most likely just the one time, and I’ll let it grow here on out. My hair is super thick and it’s hard for me to get any sort of treatments down to my scalp, it just ends up all over my hair no matter how much I try. My hope is, in the time it’s exposed I can lessen how bad it is, in a way that’s more manageable. I understand I probably won’t be able to get rid of it completely and that’s okay, I just need to not leave layers of flakes behind every time I shake my head or move it. I’m tired of how itchy it is, and how much it hurts. I’m tired of no matter how much I try to moisturize or do oil treatments or anything, it just doesn’t feel like I’m able to do enough at any one time. 

I’ve never shaved my head before though, and I have no idea what kind of scalp care is necessary. On top of trying to get rid of the thick layer of dandruff that has accumulated. I do have a scalp balm treatment I got from Lush that I plan on starting with. But is there anything else I need to know about general care, and any advice on breaking through the dandruff?

What I wasn’t expecting though is that in that time I was going to create more problems for myself later. I’ve always struggled on and off with dry scalp and dandruff. I’ve changed my shampoo and shampooing routine more times than I can count. It didn’t occur to me that not showering often enough for an extended period was going to cause extremely stubborn build up on my scalp. 

At this point it’s led to my hair falling out. And the worst part is it’s BARELY motivating me to wash it more frequently. I’ve switched to more natural products and have bought this specific scalp scrubber, and also have been doing oil treatments. I think I’d be seeing quicker progress if I could stick to being consistent with it. I even cut off all my hair to make things easier.

I worry some of these might be difficult for this reason, especially the last one, as i’ve read a lot of posts in these communities warning not to disclose to employers their autism. so just looking for advice and your thoughts and experiences in the matter :) thank you!",8,2,2,0.67,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13p4bk9')>,,/r/AutismInWomen/comments/13p4bk9/what_are_some_work_accommodations_you_have_asked/,,,False
843,yes,vancouver,2023-05-20 20:27:00,comexalone,Does anyone know if apartment buildings are legally required to provide a compost bin?,"I moved into an apartment building recently and they had a bin for compost for the couple of weeks and it’s been gone now for about a month, so now we just haven a big dumpster for garbage and two bins for recycling. It is a building that is managed by a company, no strata or anything. I know vancouver is a pretty green city so i’m just wondering are they obligated to provide somewhere for my compost or do I have to drive it somewhere? Thanks!

edit: i’ve contacted the city and they’ve let me know it is something to be reported to them or to the waste management company the building uses!thanks to everyone who provided actual answers and sorry to the people who this post bothered! thought i would ask my fellow vancouverites for guidance!",23,27,27,0.78,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13n77m3')>,,/r/vancouver/comments/13n77m3/does_anyone_know_if_apartment_buildings_are/,,,False
844,yes,neurodiversity,2023-04-28 16:46:57,comexalone,Could someone please help me understand how ADHD and Autism interact when co-occurring?,"I find the venn diagrams that come up on google images a bit over-simplistic and then reading big medical documents a bit overwhelming. Basically what i am understanding is that they have a lot of overlap, and then it seems like the big difference is (according to the venn diagrams) how you handle your daily life and routines. For example one difference being that people with adhd will seek novel experiences and people with autism will crave routine and have anxiety about novel experiences. How does this work if one has both? Also are there any social symptoms that occur in adhd other than rejection sensitivity dysphoria? Looking for anecdotal responses and also if anyone could provide a good reference for me it’s much appreciated!

My first guess it that i should  “imagine” the energy moving up, or focusing my attention on/thinking about how my neck feels. or could it mean to stretch those areas?

Here’s my poem

It’s been twenty two years
Long enough to know I’m weird 
Can’t seem to figure out why I’m here
Just want to fit in, blend in, and be like all of them

But every time I open up my mouth, I always seem to choose the wrong words
It’s either un humorous, rude and awkward 
I try to put on a face, smile and seem interested 
But it comes off as everything but the opposite 

Can’t even engage, always taking things the wrong way
Can’t get the tone and facial expressions in the right context 

In between needing people and having space
But getting overwhelmed with pretending and everything in my way
Sounds, lights and people make me want to run away

I’m 22 and diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. I have a really hard time expressing my feelings. The symptoms I lost below, I haven’t been able to explain it during my past therapy sessions. I’m planning on writing these down and giving it to my psychiatrist in my next visit. I desperately feel alone and want to know if anyone experiences these issues. 
__

In the middle of a conversation I will just zone out. I get quiet and feel a lost of energy and just want to be alone and notice I start speaking very quietly basically like whispering. I don’t know why this happens

I seem to always make things about myself in conversations it’s the only way I know how to relate but my friends have noticed and they say it’s quite annoying 


I take a lot of things literal and don’t know when someone is serious or joking 

Everyone says my humor isn’t funny and quite confusing, I guess the way I see things are very different to others.

I find it so hard to do simple things. My room can never stay organized. First, it takes me ages to bring myself to clean and then a few days later it’s suddenly messy again and it’s just an ongoing cycle. The problem is I see the mess and I really want to clean up but I can’t bring myself to do it. And when I finally do it , it makes me feel so exhausted. L

I can be very decisive and impulsive. My friends have mentioned a lot how I say things without thinking and sometimes it’s blunt and quite rude. 

I also forget what I had just said like a minute before moving on to another topic. 

I have trouble recognizing people’s facial expressions and tones. Sometimes I can’t tell whether people are happy or upset with me. And people always say it’s hard to interact with me because the things I say they never know if I’m joking or serious because my facial expressions and tone are out of sync.


I go through so many phases of hyper focusing on things and it’s something I can’t stop thinking about until I wind up losing interest. And I ramble on about it and talk about it as much as I can with friends and family. It’s quite embarrassing but I can’t help myself.

When I get excited I flap my hands and jump up and down. I know it looks childish so I try not to. 

When I’m stressed I need to fidget with my fidget toys but they don’t seem to help much. The way I can explain it is that I feel like I have electricity running through me and there’s no way to let it out. I feel irritable a lot of the time because I don’t know how to explain how it feels inside my body and brain. 



Sometimes I randomly feel like I need to cry  

Big crowds overwhelm me, not because I’m scared of people it just feels like too much going on around me with noise,  lights and people. 

I like to plan things ahead of time. I don’t like when plans are changed.

I get attached to people so easily like a child and I hate it so much

It’s very hard for me to finish any assignment up until the last minute. No matter if I enjoy it or don’t the only thing that pushes me is until the last few minutes it’s due.

I go from one extreme to the other. For example I can be very excited to extremely disappointed. If I get critiqued on something I go and do the complete opposite I don’t know how to be balanced. 

I find it hard to follow instructions with more than one step involved, unless clearly laid out in written form. I require everyone to be very clear with me, otherwise I won't feel able to complete a task. I know this will only get worst once I get a job if I can even get one

Edit:
My psychiatrist read the list and asked me a few questions and then brought in my mom. Ofc my mom doesn’t understand how I feel and just said I seem fine to her. My psychiatrist just wrote me another prescription of the same dosage and medication and said to try and plan my day and do two tasks to help me get started and to train my brain. My chest physically hurts and I feel like this was the last straw.

Sometimes I randomly feel like I need to cry  

Big crowds overwhelm me, not because I’m scared of people it just feels like too much going on around me with noise,  lights and people. 

I like to plan things ahead of time. I don’t like when plans are changed.

I get attached to people so easily like a child and I hate it so much

It’s very hard for me to finish any assignment up until the last minute. No matter if I enjoy it or don’t the only thing that pushes me is until the last few minutes it’s due.

I go from one extreme to the other. For example I can be very excited to extremely disappointed. If I get critiqued on something I go and do the complete opposite I don’t know how to be balanced. 

I find it hard to follow instructions with more than one step involved, unless clearly laid out in written form. I require everyone to be very clear with me, otherwise I won't feel able to complete a task. I know this will only get worst once I get a job if I can even get one

I’m 22 and diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. I have a really hard time expressing my feelings. The symptoms I lost below, I haven’t been able to explain it during my past therapy sessions. I’m planning on writing these down and giving it to my psychiatrist in my next visit. I desperately feel alone and want to know if anyone experiences these issues. 
__

In the middle of a conversation I will just zone out. I get quiet and feel a lost of energy and just want to be alone and notice I start speaking very quietly basically like whispering. I don’t know why this happens

I seem to always make things about myself in conversations it’s the only way I know how to relate but my friends have noticed and they say it’s quite annoying 


I take a lot of things literal and don’t know when someone is serious or joking 

Everyone says my humor isn’t funny and quite confusing, I guess the way I see things are very different to others.

I find it so hard to do simple things. My room can never stay organized. First, it takes me ages to bring myself to clean and then a few days later it’s suddenly messy again and it’s just an ongoing cycle. The problem is I see the mess and I really want to clean up but I can’t bring myself to do it. And when I finally do it , it makes me feel so exhausted. L

I can be very decisive and impulsive. My friends have mentioned a lot how I say things without thinking and sometimes it’s blunt and quite rude. 

I also forget what I had just said like a minute before moving on to another topic. 

I have trouble recognizing people’s facial expressions and tones. Sometimes I can’t tell whether people are happy or upset with me. And people always say it’s hard to interact with me because the things I say they never know if I’m joking or serious because my facial expressions and tone are out of sync.


I go through so many phases of hyper focusing on things and it’s something I can’t stop thinking about until I wind up losing interest. And I ramble on about it and talk about it as much as I can with friends and family. It’s quite embarrassing but I can’t help myself.

When I get excited I flap my hands and jump up and down. I know it looks childish so I try not to. 

When I’m stressed I need to fidget with my fidget toys but they don’t seem to help much.

I take a lot of things literal and don’t know when someone is serious or joking 

Everyone says my humor isn’t funny and quite confusing, I guess the way I see things are very different to others.

I find it so hard to do simple things. My room can never stay organized. First, it takes me ages to bring myself to clean and then a few days later it’s suddenly messy again and it’s just an ongoing cycle. The problem is I see the mess and I really want to clean up but I can’t bring myself to do it. And when I finally do it , it makes me feel so exhausted. L

I can be very decisive and impulsive. My friends have mentioned a lot how I say things without thinking and sometimes it’s blunt and quite rude. 

I also forget what I had just said like a minute before moving on to another topic. 

I have trouble recognizing people’s facial expressions and tones. Sometimes I can’t tell whether people are happy or upset with me. And people always say it’s hard to interact with me because the things I say they never know if I’m joking or serious because my facial expressions and tone are out of sync.


I go through so many phases of hyper focusing on things and it’s something I can’t stop thinking about until I wind up losing interest. And I ramble on about it and talk about it as much as I can with friends and family. It’s quite embarrassing but I can’t help myself.

When I get excited I flap my hands and jump up and down. I know it looks childish so I try not to. 

When I’m stressed I need to fidget with my fidget toys but they don’t seem to help much. The way I can explain it is that I feel like I have electricity running through me and there’s no way to let it out. I feel irritable a lot of the time because I don’t know how to explain how it feels inside my body and brain. 



Sometimes I randomly feel like I need to cry  

Big crowds overwhelm me, not because I’m scared of people it just feels like too much going on around me with noise,  lights and people. 

I like to plan things ahead of time. I don’t like when plans are changed.

I get attached to people so easily like a child and I hate it so much

It’s very hard for me to finish any assignment up until the last minute. No matter if I enjoy it or don’t the only thing that pushes me is until the last few minutes it’s due.

I go from one extreme to the other. For example I can be very excited to extremely disappointed. If I get critiqued on something I go and do the complete opposite I don’t know how to be balanced. 

I find it hard to follow instructions with more than one step involved, unless clearly laid out in written form. I require everyone to be very clear with me, otherwise I won't feel able to complete a task. I know this will only get worst once I get a job if I can even get one

It’s very hard for me to finish any assignment up until the last minute. No matter if I enjoy it or don’t the only thing that pushes me is until the last few minutes it’s due.

I go from one extreme to the other. For example I can be very excited to extremely disappointed. If I get critiqued on something I go and do the complete opposite I don’t know how to be balanced. 

I find it hard to follow instructions with more than one step involved, unless clearly laid out in written form. I require everyone to be very clear with me, otherwise I won't feel able to complete a task. I know this will only get worst once I get a job if I can even get one

I’m 22 and diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. I have a really hard time expressing my feelings. The symptoms I lost below, I haven’t been able to explain it during my past therapy sessions. I’m planning on writing these down and giving it to my psychiatrist in my next visit. I desperately feel alone and want to know if anyone experiences these issues. 
__

In the middle of a conversation I will just zone out. I get quiet and feel a lost of energy and just want to be alone and notice I start speaking very quietly basically like whispering. I don’t know why this happens

I seem to always make things about myself in conversations it’s the only way I know how to relate but my friends have noticed and they say it’s quite annoying 


I take a lot of things literal and don’t know when someone is serious or joking 

Everyone says my humor isn’t funny and quite confusing, I guess the way I see things are very different to others.

I find it so hard to do simple things. My room can never stay organized. First, it takes me ages to bring myself to clean and then a few days later it’s suddenly messy again and it’s just an ongoing cycle. The problem is I see the mess and I really want to clean up but I can’t bring myself to do it. And when I finally do it , it makes me feel so exhausted. L

I can be very decisive and impulsive. My friends have mentioned a lot how I say things without thinking and sometimes it’s blunt and quite rude. 

I also forget what I had just said like a minute before moving on to another topic. 

I have trouble recognizing people’s facial expressions and tones. Sometimes I can’t tell whether people are happy or upset with me. And people always say it’s hard to interact with me because the things I say they never know if I’m joking or serious because my facial expressions and tone are out of sync.


I go through so many phases of hyper focusing on things and it’s something I can’t stop thinking about until I wind up losing interest. And I ramble on about it and talk about it as much as I can with friends and family. It’s quite embarrassing but I can’t help myself.

When I get excited I flap my hands and jump up and down. I know it looks childish so I try not to. 

When I’m stressed I need to fidget with my fidget toys but they don’t seem to help much. The way I can explain it is that I feel like I have electricity running through me and there’s no way to let it out. I feel irritable a lot of the time because I don’t know how to explain how it feels inside my body and brain. 



Sometimes I randomly feel like I need to cry  

Big crowds overwhelm me, not because I’m scared of people it just feels like too much going on around me with noise,  lights and people.

I feel irritable a lot of the time because I don’t know how to explain how it feels inside my body and brain. 



Sometimes I randomly feel like I need to cry  

Big crowds overwhelm me, not because I’m scared of people it just feels like too much going on around me with noise,  lights and people. 

I like to plan things ahead of time. I don’t like when plans are changed.

I get attached to people so easily like a child and I hate it so much

It’s very hard for me to finish any assignment up until the last minute. No matter if I enjoy it or don’t the only thing that pushes me is until the last few minutes it’s due.

I go from one extreme to the other. For example I can be very excited to extremely disappointed. If I get critiqued on something I go and do the complete opposite I don’t know how to be balanced. 

I find it hard to follow instructions with more than one step involved, unless clearly laid out in written form. I require everyone to be very clear with me, otherwise I won't feel able to complete a task.

I go through so many phases of hyper focusing on things and it’s something I can’t stop thinking about until I wind up losing interest. And I ramble on about it and talk about it as much as I can with friends and family. It’s quite embarrassing but I can’t help myself.

I mostly worry about this ‘cuz I tend to grin when I get nervous and sometimes laugh randomly because I thought of something funny, so I worry that people will think I’m amused at like, a funeral, or something.

I also worried I wouldn’t seem excited/happy enough at my older sibling’s wedding, but I think I ultimately was appropriately emotional? 

I didn’t worry about this as much until after I got diagnosed because the doctor who diagnosed me described me as having a ‘flat affect’. Around the same time, I started filming myself in cosplay for TikToks and I realized I have to extremely exaggerate expressions for it to look like I’m emoting. So essentially, my face doesn’t always express the emotions I think I am expressing (explains why people always think I’m angry when I’m not smiling, I guess) (before this, I didn’t film myself much, and I have a blank expression in most of my selfies). 

So I’m just a little curious if anyone else here feels like this sometimes?",37,121,121,0.99,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13rtmtd')>,,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/13rtmtd/does_anyone_else_ever_worry_they_wont_express_the/,,,False
952,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-05-20 23:41:52,doomed-kelpie,I Feel Like a lot of People are Scaring Me Now that I’m Diagnosed,"So, I went most of my life not knowing I was autistic and not really understanding what autism even was until high school. However, I got ‘officially’ diagnosed about a year ago. 

And I feel like, ever since, all I see online is stuff telling me I shouldn’t have done that. Every time I interact with autistic spaces, half of what I see is people going on and on about 600 reasons why it’s bad to get an official diagnosis and how I’m going to get discriminated against and stuff like that. I also see a lot of stuff about how it won’t help to get a diagnosis anyway because there aren’t a lot of benefits to it once you’re out of school and don’t need a 504. Part of what really scares is me is stuff like people saying that having a diagnosis is going to stop me from getting gender-affirming care or from going to other countries and things like that. 

And it’s like. I did have an awareness that there can be downsides to getting a formal diagnosis before I got diagnosed, but I feel like I personally needed to. Aside from feeling like I was ‘faking’ all the time, I also feel like I do need a diagnosis for people to take it seriously. I even had a therapist who refused to listen when I told her I thought I was autistic and treated me very badly because of her belief that she just needed to treat me as though I have ‘severe anxiety’. This would include turning her camera off and ignoring me if I had trouble talking for too long and forcing me to watch a video of someone getting surgery while they were awake and making me watch the whole thing again if I moved (I was also being treated for a needle phobia). 

Along with this, I have a lot of severe phobias relating to medical care, particularly anything with needles. Me being autistic is pretty relevant to this because my reactions in a medical setting can be downright dangerous. I will scream, fight, try to escape, shut down, and/or avoid getting medical care I need altogether. Before getting diagnosed, my parents would just tell them about my needle phobia and doctors would underestimate it and think I would just have a little anxiety, so they wouldn’t be prepared and things would go badly. Now that I have a diagnosis on paper, doctors seem to understand a little better, even if I get kinda infantilized sometimes. When I needed an MRI, and also when I went to the ER, the doctors easily agreed to give me Valium. Nurses are a little nicer and will listen (for the most part) when they’re told how to keep me calm. The hospital and doctor’s office don’t argue when my parents need to stay with me. I feel like having the diagnosis in my chart really helps make things go a little smoother. 

When I was younger, I could kinda get away with avoiding the doctor more ‘cuz I was mostly healthy physically, but for the last few years, I’ve had a lot of health problems (including cancer that luckily didn’t need chemo but still sucked and had medical consequences). I can’t avoid getting medical care anymore because I now have life-long health conditions as well as some health problems that will hopefully resolve eventually. Which forces me to go into very stressful situations at the doctor all the time. I wasn’t diagnosed yet when I had cancer, and I needed it removed during the height of the pandemic, and my parents had to argue to be able to stay with me because of COVID restrictions. I was also held down when I freaked out about a finger prick because the nurse wouldn’t give me a minute to calm down. The dentist wouldn’t even let my mom come with me at all when I had to go. But I need my parents to be there both for comfort and because I tend to shut down and no longer understand what’s happening or be able to respond to questions. Without them, I just agree to whatever people say to me, no matter what it is. I’ve signed papers without understanding what I’m signing because I’ve been too scared to process them. 

It really just feels easier to have everyone on the same page and to have accommodations to keep me calm. I feel like I need a formal diagnosis to get medical care without being traumatized. 

But now all I see is people telling me how I’m stupid for getting diagnosed and stupid for putting it in my medical file because people say my rights are going to be taken away. But I feel like I didn’t really have a choice. What was I supposed to do, get held down and sedated by surprised doctors whenever I have a medical problem? Get traumatized even more until I refuse to go anymore and end up dying from something preventable? I’ve needed help and accommodations and just wasn’t getting them before, and I was not getting medical care I needed. I avoided getting a surgery I needed for five years because I was too scared. 

I’d rather be treated like a baby than be held down, and I’d rather tell the doctor I’m autistic than catch someone off guard while they’re putting needles in my body. I don’t want to lose rights like people keep saying I will, but I feel like most discrimination I’ve faced is the same as before even I knew I was autistic. I just didn’t know why people reacted to me a certain way before. And I can’t do anything about legal threats to my rights because my medical care is a more immediate need than a threat. 

So I don’t know. I’m just getting the impression that a lot of other autistic people think it’s dumb to get formally diagnosed but I feel like I didn’t have much choice anymore. And I’m just tired of constantly being scared that I’ve made some kind of huge mistake when I just want to get medical care.

EDIT: I’m reassured by the responses to this post. Sometimes I just need a little reminder that people don’t all have the same opinions as other people I happen to interact with online. I was just getting really worried about some things I’ve been hearing. 
(Also, to clarify, I do think self-diagnosis is valid, just as I think some people need a diagnosis. People have different needs, I was just starting to feel like the choices I made based on my own needs were bad because of how certain people have been talking and scaring me)",41,59,59,0.95,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13ncs57')>,,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/13ncs57/i_feel_like_a_lot_of_people_are_scaring_me_now/,,,False

1053,yes,ASDcareers,2023-05-26 10:58:23,kerghan41,Leveraging special interests to create a technical blog. This can make a good amount of income if you stick with it.,"Years back I had a special interest in refrigerants and refrigeration. Don't ask me why, but I can tell you anything and everything about it. I had the idea to start cataloguing every type of refrigerant, their chemical composition, pressures for superheat and subcool, among many other things. This slowly turned into other topics in the same niche.

The site was made with WordPress and cost about $10-$15.00 a month to host and operate. Very cheap investment. It took about six months to a year for it to start making money.

At its peak I made $65,000 a year in profit from the site. This was through affiliate marketing, commissions, advertising, and market reports. 

I had success with this as I stuck with it and had an obsessive interest about the topic. It involved writing 1, 2, or 5 articles every week.

This may be a good income approach for others on the spectrum. I'm working on three other sites now that are bringing in extra revenue. You could to.

I work for a company that has hundreds of thousands of products. Each one has individual sales, costs, minimum order quantities, lead times from order to arrival, weights, etc. Each one may also have multiple vendors to buy from and you have to make determination based on a set of established rules.

Planning the inventory for a larger distribution company is a skill and there are quite a few forecasting models and software out there. Some are as basic as if you have three hits in twelve months the products are automatically brought in where others have an extremely strict set of criteria that can vary wildly based on the category of product that is being reviewed.

This job is similar to Pricing but instead of reviewing price points you are viewing inventory demand, sales orders, quantities, and lead times. The goal is to have JUST enough inventory on hand to answer demand but not too much or too little.

This job, depending on the company you work for will be either using complex forecasting software or it could be just basic Excel work.",3,3,3,0.8,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13rspli')>,,/r/ASDcareers/comments/13rspli/inventory_forecasting_or_inventory_planning/,,,False
1059,yes,ASDcareers,2023-05-25 20:29:41,kerghan41,Software Business Analyst Technical & Non-Technical,"I spent some years working as a software business analyst. This was for a company that had their own homegrown ERP system. They had over a dozen full time developers on staff and could make changes as desired but these changes had to be gathered, documented, and mapped out. This is where the Business Analyst comes in.

The job was something like this:

* Director of Sales wants the system to do XYZ.
* Director of Sales contacts me and we have a brief chat.
* We then have a deeper dive meeting to understand fully what he needs. I may have a mock-up or process flow created using Visio.
* He either approves my requirements or tells me I'm completely wrong and we go back to drawing board.
* If approved I then translate the requirements as clearly as I can so that our IT Project Manger or Developer can understand them and begin work.
* If questions arise during the work, which should be rare, the developer can reach out to me. The more concise your requirements though the less questions there will be.
* When the change is completed the Developer will put it in a development environment for you to test. In some cases there may be a Software Quality Assurance team member that tests as well.
* If there are failures it is sent back to the Developer. 
* If it passes then it is deployed the following week and you can go tell the business that change XYZ is complete. 
* If the change is complex then you may need to walk them through it or create an instruction manual on how it works.

I did this job for years and I had a good time. Some of the business stakeholders can be extremely stupid and not understand that you can't change XYZ because of ABC but you have to be patient with them and explain the best you can why or why not you can't do something.

1060,yes,ASDcareers,2023-05-25 20:22:54,kerghan41,Pricing Analyst & Pricing Manager Jobs,"Throughout my twenty year career I spent about four years as either a Pricing Analyst or a Pricing Manager. I thoroughly enjoyed both jobs. It was an office setting and also a remote setting during Covid years.

The jobs can vary depending on what company you look for but in most cases it involves heavy work with data manipulation. Tools used can be Excel, various BI tools, and the business' ERP system.

Most of your time is playing with numbers and datasets. Depending on the size of the company you may have other Pricing Analysts you work with or it may just be you. The Pricing Managers have to deal with other departments/people more but there is still a lot of data and logic work.

A few years back I was placed in charge to revamp the entire company's pricing structure. Starting from scratch. This involved learning the ins and outs of the Infor ERP system and what it could and could not do. Once I had the capabilities understood I could then determine what our historical pricing system had worked. The final part was improving the pricing logic but also having as little impact on existing customers as possible.

There was a lot of trial and error. Impact models ran in Excel and eventually I was able to get us within 1.50% of historical prices using new more adaptable logic with the Infor system.

During this project I barely spoke to anyone. It was all work done while listening to music and intense focusing. This is why I think it is a great career for those of us with ASD.",3,1,1,0.67,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13rs91y')>,,/r/ASDcareers/comments/13rs91y/pricing_analyst_pricing_manager_jobs/,,,False
1061,yes,ASDcareers,2023-05-25 15:51:23,kerghan41,"My path to $200,000 a year as someone with ASD1. If you like data and numbers it may be for you.","Hello everyone. Earlier this year, on my 36th birthday, I was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder Level 1. I had slipped under the radar so to speak as I had always performed very well in school. I never bothered with college. Instead I graduated high school early to start working. 

For a few years out of high school I worked at a drug store chain doing odd jobs and eventually moved to Assistant Manager. It was NOT the job for me. Too many customer interactions and at the end of the day I'd end up burned out. It was not sustainable. During this time I was also working with inventory forecasting software and when I was twenty a family friend said they were looking for an inventory planner at a medium sized distribution company. (Keeping details vague).

I interviewed for the job... awkwardly, but I somehow still moved on to see more details and eventually got a job offer. This was back in 2007 and the pay was about $28,000. More or less about the same I was making now but with this job I could sit in front of a desk all day and play with numbers. Changing forecasts, planning bulk purchase orders, etc. 

I took the job without hesitation. Life was immediately better. There were only three to four people I had to talk to. Otherwise it was putting headphones in all day and playing with numbers. Reviewing if forecast for this location mad sense or not. If not, tweaking the planning parameters. 

I stayed at this company for ten years. Over those years I taught myself Excel beginning to advanced, VBA, SQL, and even some basic RPG programming. With each year that passed I became more advanced in my skillset and they kept promoting me. At the end of my tenure I was managing all of the pricing logic, the accounting logic, KPIs/dashboards, software requirement gathering, and so many other areas. 

The job was a lot of fun and still had quite a few challenges. The downside was the pay never really came. Over my ten years there I went from $28,000 to $54,000. I was SOOOO comfortable but a former co worker of mien finally convinced me to leave and try a different company out. It was the best decision I ever made.

I went over to a similar company but within the IT department. This time I was a Software Business Analyst. The job was basically sitting one on one with stakeholders in the business, identifying WHAT they want the system to do, documenting it, and then translating my notes over to a developer friendly requirements document. I would then work with the developer to make sure they understood the change request. This was very precise work and I only had to talk with the same five to six people again. It also helped that a lot of it was done over the phone or in one on one closed offices/conference rooms.

I was at this role for 2.5 years and my pay ended at $88,000. I had a lot of fun with this as were working on a completely custom ERP system and e-commerce system. When we would make a change it had to be thoroughly thought out and documented to ensure there were no downstream effects. There was also a lot of software testing and troubleshooting to work through. 

The friend who got me over to this company left after two years. I stayed another 6 months and then he reached out to me saying he has another Business Analyst opportunity. This time it was creating and planning an e-commerce site from scratch with a tight deadline. A fun challenge to say the least. Lots of documentation, process flows, working with developers from Sweden and India. The pay when I started $105,000. 

We launched the site right before the deadline. Before launching I had to manage a 3PL warehouse, hire technical sales people, and get everything organized, planned, and ready. It was a challenge and I didn't like the people aspects of it. The planning and documentation was the fun part.

After the launch of this business I was also tapped to redo all of the pricing logic that the company was using. During this time I got a raise. This was during Covid so I was working remote as well. Pricing is A LOT of fun if you like data and numbers.

A few years later I was contacted by another company out of the blue. They were trying to recruit me to run their e-commerce stores. I was very happy with my current employer so I played hard ball with negotiation. I gave them a stupid salary number thinking they wouldn't accept it. Well... they did.

I am now a senior director managing e-commerce, business intelligence, sales processes. I work remote full time. Very little travel. I have a team of about 5 people. A few analysts, content writers, and advertising people. We've grown sixty percent each year I've been here. 

My biggest strengths are:

* Organization
* Data manipulation and analysis

1062,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-05-24 12:09:39,kerghan41,Numbers are very comforting.,"Numbers have always grounded and centered me. I'm not some mathematical genius either, very far from it. But, when stressed, or trying to calm or center myself I find that I either count in multiples of X or I count by prime numbers in my head. 

For example, randomly start counting by 7s and won't stop until I'm well into hundreds if not thousands. I do this a lot and depending on my goal I'll do easier multiples or harder multiples. For example if I'm trying to distract my mind I'll focus on prime numbers but if I'm just looking to be comforted I'll count by 3s.

This is a bit personal, but during sex some people think about baseball or other things to make it last longer. Me? I count multiples or prime numbers silently to myself.

I emphasize with his disability. I'm diagnosed with ASD1. I love computers and electronics but the handicaps that Chuck has remind me of myself. Hardly leaving the house. When he does leave the house there is great strain. Not being able to connect with people. His divorce and my divorce seemed similar.

1113,yes,aspergers,2023-01-19 15:20:41,kerghan41,My ideal retirement...,"I plan on buying 10-30 acres in southern Missouri northern Arkansas. The land out there is very cheap and I've explored the area many times before.

It is so peaceful. As a boy I vacationed there. We stayed in a secluded log cabin next to a creek. We could hear the water flowing at all times. It was spring time. Everything was wet. Moss was growing everywhere. I picked this time to read LOTR for the first time and ever since then I always associate 'The Shire' with the Ozarks. 

The land I'll buy will either have a large pond/lake or a river/creek running through it on 10-30 acres. (You can get this for $100,000 or so.) After that I'll get a steel building home built, or a manufactured home, right next to the water.

My days will be spent listening to nature, watching the water, and working on my writing. I don't get to write much anymore with my current job but in the past I've written novels as well as technical blogs. Writing is so freeing. It is just you and your projects.

I'm still about 15 years away from this dream but it is what keeps me going.

1120,yes,AutismTranslated,2022-12-07 15:13:52,kerghan41,I'm seeing a specialist soon for the first time. I've been putting together a list of what I believe are my symptoms. Thoughts?,"Some background, I am a 36 year old male. I've never seen a therapist, counselor, or anything. I'm hoping to get diagnosed or at least a professional's opinion. I don't need assistance or anything like that... but I've always felt different and would LOVE to know why.


* Eye Contact - Have always had trouble making eye contact... with anyone. Even my closest family members. I can force myself to do it with people close to me (All 6 of them), but that's it. Eye contact with a stranger is extremely difficult. 
* Posture - Have been told that I stand awkwardly. Always stand in an 'L' shape with my feet. Made a post about this the other day.
* Motor Skills - Had very poor coordination as a kid. Has gotten slightly better as an adult, but still subpar. Also have extreme trouble trying to mimic movements such as dancing or exercise routines. I was picked last every time in gym. 
* Outsider - Have always felt like an outsider my entire life. Every once and a while I would have one, maybe two, friends who were large extroverts. I would attach myself to them and be introduced to a few other people. This allowed me to have a small grouping of friends in school. Since adulthood however my list of friends has shrunk to one. 
* Bullying - Throughout school the bullying was intense. Physically attacked, spit on, punched, kicked, etc. It was because of this that I grew obsessed with body building. (Gained 70 pounds in a year and a half) 
* Speech/Hearing - I had multiple ear infections and surgeries as a child. I was in speech therapy from kindergarten to sixth grade where I decided to quit against their recommendations. (It was singling me out for bullying even more.) I am very well read but today I still don't know how to pronounce a lot of words so I just avoid them at all costs. Along with that I have the hardest time hearing ANYTHING if there is a lot of noise going on. Everything just blends together into one loud roar. I can't make out any sounds or anything that people are saying. Because of this I try to avoid those areas as much as possible. If I am at a work function with a large group of people I usually don't say anything and just sit in the back as far away from the noise as I can. I also tell people that I'm deaf in one ear as it makes them speak louder and clearer and I can then begin to hear them above the roar.
* Special Interests - My interests have changed over the years. In childhood it was video games, reading, and drawing. I would create very complex custom scenario maps in RTS games. I would build elaborate towns with Legos or Lincoln Logs. I've always been fascinated with horror and was reading King books in 5th grade. I've been obsessed with fitness and weights since I was teenager and keep up on it today. Today though I would say my special interest is my career. I've spent almost twenty years in the same industry specializing in business intelligence, sales operations, and digital landscape. I don't believe there is anyone else in the industry who has my experience/knowledge. Because of this I am paid VERY well. (Over $200k). Also, not the most relevant, but my nickname at work is 'Rain Man.' I love building complex formulas in Excel, VBA, or SQL. 
* Special Interests (2) - There was a time a few years back where I was obsessed with writing novels. It's practically all I did. I wrote 5 novels and multiple short stories in the span of 12 months.
* Special Interests (3) - I documented every possible detail I could on the various types of refrigerants used throughout the world. I went back in time, modern day, and future. I created a blog for this and exceeded over 1 million written words and 500 published articles. The site today is referenced in Wikipedia and in US Senate legislation. The site brought in a revenue of over $1 million dollars. I sold it last year due to a divorce.
* Special Interests (4) - I've been playing the same video game for almost twenty years now. (DOTA). It's mostly all that I play. I watch the same shows and movies over and over again and listen to the same songs on repeat every day.
* Divorce - My wife of 14 years left me because I had no passion, no empathy, and was cold and emotionless. This is what led me on the path of thinking that I have autism.
* Stimming - I never really noticed stereotypical stimming in my part. None of the hand flapping but I do obsessively bounce my leg/knees especially when I am in unfamiliar territory. I also pace quickly back and forth in unfamiliar places. Along with that I am constantly clearing my throat or making other 'throat' noises. No idea why I do this and don't know if this counts as stimming. 
* Scripts - To get as far as I have in my career I have developed social scripts that I used every day when engaging with co-workers. I have honed these over the 20 years in my career where they are almost automatic... but I have to remember not to say my reply too fast or else I'm looked at as strange. 
* Scripts (2) - I had ALWAYS struggled making small talk and getting to know people. I read in a book years back to use the 'FORD' acronym to get to know people. First ask about their family. While they are talking look for areas that you can identify that are similar to yours or that you can relate to. Expand conversation from there. If family doesn't work then move to Occupation. What line of work? Can you begin a conversation off of it? If not occupation then try Recreation. Same approach. Lastly, 'Dreams' is the last option. I honestly haven't had this fail on me yet. Talking about the weather always ends up in a dead end so I try to avoid it.",9,5,5,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='zf3jkj')>,,/r/AutismTranslated/comments/zf3jkj/im_seeing_a_specialist_soon_for_the_first_time/,,,False

1127,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-05-25 20:20:13,LotteTheHippo,I didn't mess up big time but still feel horrible,"Summary to get you up to speed:
I (20f) study nursing. I'm in my 3rd year (out of four) and we got the news today that our whole year will go from 3 to 2 classes. This meant that they mixed all the groups. Most friend groups were kept together and some were split (for example mine, we got split 2-2, when our teacher (who was involved in this) has subtly tried to split us up for 2 years now, we are good students fyi).

This made everyone fairly upset, because we will now have classes of 26 and 27 people, instead of 3 with 17/18. We got very different news 2 weeks ago (that our while class would have the senior year together after working towards it for 3 years together).

I am the class representative, and decided that next to the messy and high emotion debate there will be tomorrow, we should send an objective and respectful email stating what it has done to us.

Now this is where I messed up. Some of our current classmates currently do an internship abroad. I should have included them more in the process before sending it. 
I learned later that they stand very differently in this than us (they are more emotionally detached and more accepting of this outcome).
We had the idea that maybe 2 girls (abroad) would want to change with 2 of my friends. This way everyone would be reunited with their friends. We wrote it down and I included that as a solution in de mail, when the girls abroad hadn't agreed to that yet. I have apologised to them both multiple times and send another mail stating that the names named shouldn't have happened, because not everyone had said yes to this yet. 
The girls did say they didn't blame me, but next time to communicate to them first and that they hope this doesn't have any consequences. That made me feel alright but horrible.

Later I got more feedback that some others from abroad found it to emotional and had some comments about wording and points made. We called and everyone explained their side (them not finding this very nice towards the new potential classmates and me saying we purely wanted to express emotion in this and tell what it did to us about what and how it happened). They sounded okay with it, and I did apologise multiple times again that I should have included them more.

I am crying rn, because I should have waited longer to send it, even though a different teacher said it was nicely written and my whole class said to send it.

Everyone forgave me or said it was okay, but I'm still very disappointed in myself.
I'm so tired these days (I'm also overstimulated from having so much going on and really want to do everything right)

1133,yes,GayChristians,2021-06-17 17:05:46,LotteTheHippo,Translation of the/my interview about sexuality and God,"  

**My sexuality led to a conflict between God and me**  

Lotte (18) discovered a year and a half ago that her sexuality is different from what she was used to in her hetero-surroundings. That’s because she discovered she’s attracted to men and women. From that moment on a conflict started with God. “I bargained and asked if I couldn’t just like men.”

“A year and a half ago I dreamed that I was married to a woman. I thought: ‘Me with a woman? That’s not possible.’ I was attracted to men so I couldn’t be a lesbian. Still the dreams kept on coming back. I asked myself if this had a meaning. Around the same time my sister showed me a series with two men who were in a relationship. This is why I started researching the LGBTQ+ community on the internet. That’s where I found the term ‘bisexual’. I never heard of it, but it was exactly how I felt. I felt understood.”

**Hetero-culture**  
“I liked knowing where I belonged, but I still pushed my feelings away. How could I be Christian and bisexual? I prayed a lot during this time and asked God to change me. I didn’t want to be like this. This is also because I was used to something different: my surroundings are dominated by hetero-culture. Also nobody talked about this topic. There is a taboo around the LGBTQ+ community.”

**Conflict**  
“My sexuality led to a conflict between God and me. I bargained with Him an asked if I couldn’t just like men. One night I admitted my sexuality to God. I told Him and hoped that He accepted me. This is just who I am. It felt like God gave me a warm, loving hug. The pressure fell off my shoulders and it was okay. I knew it was alright.”

**“People who called themselves Christians, told me I would go to hell”**

“Slowly I started accepting myself again. First on the internet, because this seemed safe and anonymous. There I sometimes told that I was bisexual AND Christian. This ended in many negative reactions. I was insulted for a long time. People who called themselves Christians, told me I would go to hell. I had to convert myself, otherwise it wouldn’t end well. This was very hard for me to read. That time has damaged my believes. If I can’t be who I am, I didn’t want to be a part of this religion”

**Warzone**  
“The LGBTQ+ community and Christians are usually opposed. It felt like a war, where I was in the middle of the battlefield. Still I always remembered the hug God gave me. This was something for me to hold on to. I believe God accepts my sexuality. He especially wants us to love our neighbours. As long as two people love each other, that’s fine I believe. Sometimes I still have – because of my bisexuality – hardships with my religion, but I still choose to believe. It gives me something to hold on to in life. I know there’s always someone who stands by me. Someone to talk to, whom I can tell everything. Also it’s nice to think that after life after death doesn’t stop, but that there’s a heaven.”

**Out of the closet**  
“At this point I feel good about my faith in combination with being bi. I’m out with most people in my direct family. Also with classmates. Everyone reacted very positive. However I do feel alone: I know almost no one in my surroundings that’s also in the LGBTQ+ community. Still it gives me strength that I know God accepts me. He loves me for who I am.”",1,28,28,0.95,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='o225hd')>,,/r/GayChristians/comments/o225hd/translation_of_themy_interview_about_sexuality/,,,False

Now we were gonna be done. We got the call from the doctor that the only thing left was the damage from the radiation therapy, and that she was cured. A week later doctors from a different hospital didn't trust the scans completely. Today we heard that there is still some cancerous tissue left. Next week Friday the will operate again, because this is the only option (other than doing nothing). This will mean that she'll loose a part of her ability to speak/find the words.

This might be disturbing for some people, so I gués this is a disclaimer-is? There is a tl;dr at the end

When I was around 10/11 I had to put something away (or something, I don't remember those details, it's been 8 years). There was a classmate that followed me somehow. We were in an empty classroom, in the back where some computers were (all of this I really remember). I was in a corner and he said the only way I would get out, was if I kissed him. Idk if it was my autism or anything, but I couldn't think of the option of pushing him/screaming or anything else. So I kissed him (so I can't really blame him) and then walked away really quickly. I still think about almost daily, and especially during kissing someone else..

How my mom knows, is I've told heer last year (2020). That's because I just needed to, because I started thinking about it a LOT around that time. It was also the time my mom really wanted me and my sisters to get boyfriends, so maybe that did something? Idk... À least she said I just needed to get over it. Maybe anyone got any tips on that?

(the next year we would go for a 3 day school outing (or whatever it's called) and out of the blue the same dude just laid on top of me. I pushed him off (of the higher bunkbed) so he fell on the ground. All the other kids were like wtf? So I also can't really have anyone lay down on top of me...

First.. is there some kind of etiquette around communicating the taking of Ei sick benefits to ones employer?  do people just generally give the notice on the last day they are available to work and let their employer figure it out or do they try to communicate this is advance?

I am struggling through significant professional and personal burnout right now and dealing with serious mental and physical health challenges as a result. Professional burnout is related to previous overwork, constantly changing workloads and job description, ongoing toxic work environment, poor and borderline harassment management style, intense lack of professionalism etc.

I already have a signed medical cert from a doctor but I havent handed it to my manager yet. I am concerned that my employer might retaliate and try to terminate me while I am away. I dont truly want to stay in this job but I am afraid of losing it because I am unsure what else might be available right now due to the pandemic.. not to mention how much harder finding new work will be while burnt out.. that thought is overwhelming. I know I need to take this rest but I am afraid it could hurt me in a way I am not yet seeing and guess I just wanted to know if there is anything I should be aware of.

I do have a decent relationship with one manager who has been supportive through this and hope to keep them as references for the future, but I am afraid to tell them for fear that upper management would find out and try to terminate me before taking EI sick benefits.

I don't see my partner much through the week and have been researching autism and audhd a lot lately (formally dx adhd, highly suspect autistic). We just had an intense 1.5 hour conversation about autism, adhd and the two together and he has long suspected he is both as well.  It was so meaningful, rewarding and intense to finally have some time to share everything I've been learning (its become a special interest) and to hear his thoughts/experience. I forced a stopping point only to realize 5 minutes later that I had blown WAY past my limits energy wise. I sat down totally quiet and put my head in my hands for the visual relief and deep pressure. He brought me my noise cancelling headphones and eyemask. I didn't even realize - but he was right. I needed to go lie down with headphones and an eyemask on because I'm overwhelmed and everything (even light) was too loud. I feel much better since doing that, though still tired.

Is overstimulating yourself when you are audhd a common experience? This happens a lot to me and for much less meaningful things (but just as interesting/engaging). I think the fact that this conversation is about ""Big Things"" and I'm already tired made this one worse. Its triggered a shutdown. Sometimes after things like this I need quiet for the rest of the day, or need to totally reset with a long nap. Sometimes even the next day I am still wiped and am very nonverbal/limited in movement. Just find I have to really rest afterward.

Now quite far down the ""am I also autistic?"" rabbit hole (answer seems to be yes). I did not think I could be autistic until I started Vyvanse and SO much became apparent to me.

I'm exploring this in therapy right now with an autistic therapist, but I was wondering, do or have any of you ever experienced any of the following while on stimulant medication:

1. Less desire to be social
2. Less ability to jump in/contribute to conversations/know what to say but also more need to consciously script  (no adhd conversation pathways randomly popping up in head)
3. Masking being harder/more onerous (when off stimulants I am more hyperexpressive; on stimulants I have a flatter affect)
4. Stronger sensory experiences (environment is louder, richer and the things that stand out/cause discomfort are louder)
5. More sensory overwhelm and potentially more shutdowns as a result
6. Notice more issues with eye contact (more discomfort, more aversion - slight or significant)

 Lately my brain is so stuck on the idea of being one or the other, not both; or in making arguments for/against autism in particular. Not sure if stimulants have made my underlying autism more obvious or if they generally have the effect of making people feel less social/emotive, etc and I am reading too much into it.",27,68,68,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13ma87l')>,,/r/AutisticWithADHD/comments/13ma87l/audhders_seeming_more_autistic_on_stimulants/,,,False
1160,yes,AuDHDWomen,2023-05-19 22:09:28,cks2016,AuDHDers; do these experiences make sense to you?,"Hey all! I am dx ADHD, highly suspect I'm AuDHD + am off my adhd meds today (wow, brain go BRR).  I'm having some significant reflections on what I believe to be the intersection of autism or autistic traits and adhd (at least for me) and wanted to get your feedback.

I have been on stimulants consistently for about 6 weeks now and have been slowly unmasking my autistic traits/self for two months. I am finding that:

\- **On stimulants, sensory issues are MUCH more apparent.** Everything in my environment is *louder or richer,* for better or worse, and I notice/fixate more what stands out/isn't right/doesn't fit/is too much (which causes me more discomfort). I feel more present, aware and tuned into my environment (less bouncing around or shooting off in a rocket to outer space) but also more drawn to quiet calm spaces and less able to distract myself from what is bothering me. This has led to more frequent shutdowns and sensory overwhelm. Not sure if this is a sort of feedback loop (able to focus on them more so they amplify) or a sort of an unveiling of what is there underneath all the adhd noise, or both..

\- **On stimulants, I find have less desire to socialize so much and masking feels more onerous.** It is harder to jump in/start conversation/know what to say next and it all requires more effort. People are a huge special interest for me but meds make me feel like I'd rather be more passive/indirect/intellectual about it or focus on a few chosen people rather than impulsively striking up conversation a lot with strangers (which I sometimes like to do unmedicated). That's too tiring now! I feel like unmedicated adhd made this easier due to natural curiosity + impulsivity + more ability to improvise in the moment based on all the natural thoughts/possible conversation pathways popping up in my head. I did also script, but it was a much faster/loose process. Without improvising as much, I rely on scripting more and it is more logically driven as well as a more challenging process overall - I get stuck for ideas on what to say or do next. Maybe this is just because I have been relying on adhd to help me with that for so long, I'm not sure any other way? I also have a flatter affect on stimulants and don't want to smile as much.

\- **I infodump just as much and am equally as socially awkward on/off meds, it just looks a little different.** I feel like my adhd 'energeticness' (wild gesticulating, fast speech, hyperexpressiveness, hyperactivity etc) in the past has distracted people from my social oddness  or seems to help ""explain away""/disguise it? Like people assume I wouldn't be as strange if I could just slow down?

\- **My stimming style seems somewhat different** though I find this hard to articulate just yet. I have felt urges to stim more calmly and repetitively; slow rocking, deep rhythmic humming, slower rhythmic stroking/touching objects. Still unmasking and recovering stims as well so this may not be related to having my adhd managed but it seems probably connected.

**- Having ADHD in the mix has made imposter syndrome (re: autism) worse for me. T**he two together often feel paradoxical at times and my brain feels like they must therefore logically cancel each other out (black and white thinking). It also gets hung up on the idea that I must be be one or the other, not both - building arguments for/against either category. Yet I relate significantly most of all to AuDHD experiences.

**Does anyone relate?**

&#x200B;

Sometimes I wonder if adhd is in some way a neurodevelopmental response/coping style that can stems out of elevated autistic traits/autism. Hard to say as for me I don't think I am pure adhd and can compare to that.

Did adhd camouflage or help compensate for some of the challenges you experience/associate with being autistic (social, sensory)? Did it delay your discovery of your autistic self? What is your experience of being AuDHD - medicated or unmedicated?

Formally dx earlier this year w/ ADHD and pretty sure I am now comfortable self-diagnosing as autistic - though struggling with imposter syndrome still a little. I am high masking, hyperempathetic (empathic) and, previous to learning what autism really was, I identified very strongly with HSP (the highly sensitive person construct).

I am wondering if anyone shares experiences similar to mine. I am deeply sensitive at times and can be really in tune with the sensory ""rhythms"" of my environment. I feel like this is my default state when I am regulated, rested and free from demands (masking). By this I mean that I tend to notice when things like colour, sound, motion and touch come together in harmonious and/or repetitive ways. Sometimes when this sensory information comes together in a powerful, harmonious way, what results for me is a deeply emotional, moving sense of beauty and an unspoken connectedness to, what for me feels like, the heartbeat of the sensory world.. 

I also feel a strong *physical* reaction during these moments; usually my body drinks in a *deeeep* breath reflexively.. and I get deep chills (goosebumps) up/down my arms, legs and spine, I will start to tear up and often I feel a huge urge to stim - to rock or sway back and forth in harmony with that rhythm. Sometimes it happens when a voice will match and resonate with the rising sound of an instrument. Today I had a moment when I was listening to music; a crow flew in tandem alongside my bus for three blocks, riding on the wind directly across from me, looping and diving somehow perfectly with the swelling and falling of the music I was listening to. The song was one that started soft but built in tender intensity and I had just been reflecting on the cumulative grief I feel from having masked increasingly throughout my life; how cut off it has made me feel from my own nature and the world around me, how harmful it was that the knowledge of my way of being was denied to me because I was different and because I was too busy being so harshly, actively molded to inhabit some other self. A neurotypical one. What endured for me was a feeling of somehow some part of me persevering through all this.. all the difficult experiences. I felt like the crow/natural world was acknowledging this somehow (personification?).

For reference, I also see images/shapes or figures in clouds, bathroom tiles and other ambiguous sensory material often, though this often not a moving emotional experience. I also sometimes struggle to notice and name my feelings because I often feel overwhelmed by sensory or masking demands and often have coped by numbing/disassociating from my real feelings. I am also just as easily agitated by disharmonies in my environment (too much or heavily contrasting sound/colour/motion etc), repetitions becoming interrupted (patterns ending, things in motion stopping) and by things that 'stick out' or overpower others, whether that be loud out of the blue sounds or intense colours or say too much traffic. In some ways I am sensory seeking, other ways sensory avoiding.. I often need sensory things to be in the 'goldilocks zone', whatever that might be at that moment.

There is a lot of debate around the construct of HSP, whether it is code for autism without the stigma attached or whether it can occur in addition to autism. I probably fall in the first category but it makes me wonder about the experiences of other autists. I am not sure if these experiences are tied to my being high in openness to experience/spiritual by nature, HSP, the sensory/repetition aspects of autism, ADHD ""Big Feelings"", ND alexithymia (we are cut off from our feelings and suddenly, in moments like these, realize what we are feeling because it is sometimes being mirrored back to in a way we have not yet recognized?) or all of the above..

I feel like within order, structure, pattern recognition and repetition (things we naturally gravitate to as autists) there lies a lot of inherent *harmony,* which often itself underlies experiences of beauty. i.e. as in symmetry, the golden ratio, etc. Because of this, I feel like many autists might share these similar experiences.

It makes me think of a video I came across early on in my discovery journey by nonspeaker Mel Baggs' called ""In My Language""; she talks about how autism to her is about being in a constant conversation with her environment.. that resonated with me deeply, though my experience in the world is very different to Mels. And though there may or may not be controvery around Mel (I have read mixed things).

ANYWAY! Does anyone relate to this or have similar experiences? Do you have your own understanding about what gives rise to these kinds of experiences for you?

In our audhd house we love Bluey. Was also thinking about how much I LOVED magic school bus as a kid.. and realized how perfect the format of the show is for the audhd brain: they do the same basic thing every episode - hang out in class, wonder out loud about some natural phenomenon, then take a fanrastical, mega immersive feld trip to explore it. Theres a formula and structure punctuated by an exciting adventure!

I realize film and tv programming is like this generally as a whole in the sense that we tend to have a predictable structure from film/tv conventions with interesting conflict, setting, special effects etc mixed in for that dopamine-boosting awe and wonder.. but man some childrens shows just really scratch that audhd itch. perfect blended order and chaos in a neat and short (not too long) package!

I think I also liked Big Comfy Couch (shoutout to canada) for similar reasons.. the mc is a very sort of adhd/audhd character.. makes a big mess (literally/metaphorically) and then by the end of the episode quickly and painlessly tidies it all up. The mess/chaos and the tidyness/order (as well as relatable character) just tickle my brain.

1166,yes,ADHD,2023-03-30 02:48:05,cks2016,ADHD Diagnosis/Treatment Unveiling Autism or Autistic Traits?,"Hi everyone,

Forgive me if this is a little meandering. I am struggling to process everything.

I am in my early 30s and for the last few months I have been going through the process of learning about/understanding my adhd and received a formal diagnosis. I've been seeing a counsellor that specializes in adhd prior to this on a weekly basis  to openly question and make sense of my life experiences, process my knew understanding of adhd and how it has impacted me, and to process some of the new unknowns or OTHER questions this also brings up..

The most recent turn in this journey has me questioning whether or not I may be on the spectrum in some way..  When I was screened for spectrum traits during my adhd assessment, the screen was positive (suggesting further investigation needed). At the time I brushed it off but now, especially after starting stimulant medication, I am seeing what changes and what doesn't change with the support of medication.. and I find myself considering my underlying autistic traits.. 

I know there is often a lot of overlap/comorbidity between ASD and ADHD and this is not uncommon, but it took me so long to see/validate/understand ADHD.. and in my ignorance (having associated asd with the stereotypical 'male' phenotype) I really did not (and still in many ways do not) understand just *how much* *autistic experience varies* from person to person, and how it presents differently particularly women and in individuals with other 'conditions'. I'm wondering, did any of you experience this similar new picture coming into focus about autism or your autistic traits after receiving your adhd diagnosis or treatment? If you went through a period of questioning, what helped you to understand your experience? Were there certain resources or tools you used to help you better understand yourself? Did you end up getting assessed?

I realize my autistic traits look different as a woman (vs man) and also as a woman with adhd.. it is very hard to understand. I feel like if I am autistic, or have autistic traits.. they lean more borderline/mild maybe and my adhd may be the larger influence. But I am not sure, because I was blind to my adhd for so long - I think in a lot of ways I am still ignorant to my own autistic traits. I am trying to find more information about.. (please forgive me, these are the labels I've found) mild/high functioning/level 1/borderline/subclinical autism and the 'broader autistic phenotype'.. It is so hard to find info about the first-hand experiences of individuals who fall in this category.

If anyone could take some time to share a bit about their journey, particularly if your autism was more camouflaged to you, I'd be so so grateful.

I am 31f, trauma survivor and lifelong adhder who is in therapy and in the process of getting diagnosed. I have endured and survived a lot in life, including the difficulties that come with undiagnosed/untreated adhd. So much of my life has been lived according to neurotypical narrative/expectations/standards that I am struggling to envision/relearn as an adult how I can be authentically myself and claim space/show up in the world just as I am.. without shame, without explanation and without apology. I'm sire receiving my formal diagnosis will help, but I've developed SUCH a strong muscle/ability for self policing (proactively/compulsively) and it is hard to undo.. I know it will take time, and compassion for myself, but I hoped to hear your experiences of what helped you to live more authentically as someone with adhd. How did you change how you interacted with your world? How did you learn to stop policing yourself so much? Were there any key words, phrases, analogies, images that you found that impacted you a lot and made it easier to do? or were there any that you used to help you stay mindful of this while you worked on it?

1169,yes,ADHD,2022-11-24 20:29:19,cks2016,Craving stimuli even when overloaded?,"Hi everyone, I am 31f and in the process of receiving a diagnosis for ADHD. All my life I have struggled with executive dysfunction and this has led to episodes of depression and a lot of internalized shame/chronic anxiety. My family shows strong ADHD symptomology as well - restlessness, driven by a motor, language/testing difficulties, disorganization, emotional dysregulation, impulsive behaviour, forgetfulness, etc.

I realize I had done so much work to he aware of and nonmedically moderate the worst of my ADHD symptoms but so much of that went out the window during the pandemic. So much upheaval has happened in my life. My symptomology is particularly bad right now - I think exacerbated by chronic stress and lack of structure in my current work/personal situation and the fact that I was put on an SSRI for depression a few months ago.

I am noticing that my brain is JUMPING around like mad from one track to the next, always with a question or thought and such a strong urge to investigate more fully. I have issues with sensory overload but am finding where I could normally use tools I developed to limit my stimulation seeking, now I cannot - even when overloaded. I will feel fatigued, my brain tired, craving a reprieve from stimuli and like a migraine is about to come on if I don't but I still can't stop myself from getting up to do things or bouncing around on my phone, opening up new tabs, googling new things. I don't even fully TAKE IN what I'm reading/watching or otherwise 'investigating' before jumping down the next rabbit hole with the first adjacent thought that pops up.

Is this part of ADHD? Do any of you struggle with stimulation seeking even past your own physical limits? I know even in terms of physical restlessness I alsp struggle to stop. I keep moving and doing things even despite chronic pain in my hips from a musculoskeletal injury because I think of things that must be done or that I want to go get/check out, etc and its impacted by health so much.

I also find it hard to find a time/place to remove myself from stimulation.. work is chaos, personal life is in limbo, my home is so disorganized and we have construction going on daily next door. I used to self moderate by quiet time in a room or walks in nature. Hard to do lately.

1170,yes,vancouver,2022-11-09 17:36:17,cks2016,Recommendation - Counsellor Specializing in ADHD/ASD (Autism),"Hi everyone, this is difficult to word as it's been a trying time lately and I am quite burnt out on multiple fronts, so please bear with me. I'm looking for a compassionate professional with a strong understanding of ADHD/ASD to speak to about some aspects of my relationship with my longtime partner.

My partner and I both live with ADHD and he is also on the spectrum. Our relationship is sometimes very challenging - as longterm partnerships often are. He is a wonderful person and I love him dearly. Because of this, I'm working hard to better understand his nuances and support him, and support myself while we navigate challenges together. I have learned so much through our four years of partnership and know he has as well. I've seen him grow in incredible ways that have challenged (and positively changed) my understanding of autism. However there is more still that I need help processing and I would like to do that work; for me, for him and for us. It has been difficult sometimes to create a pause and a place for gaining perspective, especially through all the external change and challenges of the pandemic and the added stress that has placed on us.

I'm looking to find a professional with a kind demeanour and strong, nuanced understanding of folks on the spectrum/living with ADHD.. perhaps either first or secondhand experience.. i.e. who themselves live with ASD/ADHD or who maybe have a dear friend or family member with ASD.. or who specializes in working with individuals/families living with ADHD/ASD. I have self educated a great deal many different accessible resources and have seen a professional for personal support however they lacked a level of knowledge/experience in this area and found it difficult to speak to our experiences. I was grateful still for the awareness of the impact these challenges have had on me and for their support in growing my ability to engage in effective self care, yet I still find myself needing to explore my partnership's realities and complexities more in depth with someone who has a greater deal of familiarity. I'd like to gain more clarity and objectivity on our life as it is together.

Does anyone have any recommendations for a counsellor in the vancouver area who has been a tremendous help to them in this regard? I have unfortunately found it difficult to find any accepting new clients and I am finding it hard to continue searching.

1188,yes,AutismInWomen,2023-04-14 17:10:22,AdorableAcres,Burn Out - So Many Questions,"2 years ago I experienced what I am now coming to realize was possibly autistic burnout mixed with a whole lot of cptsd. I have labeled it as a mental breakdown. My therapists and psychiatrists saw it as complete and utter overwhelm from trauma.   The treatment has been blessed venlafaxine, nightmare medication, (and after learning about adhd) adderall plus SO MUCH trauma therapy. It began as 2 hour sessions twice a week for about 8 months, moved to weekly sessions then bi-weekly sessions. Clearly it helped. But....I will never be done with unpacking the trauma, it seems. At this rate I could be unpacking trauma once a week for all eternity. I am ready to not just exist, but to live life again.

 Except I can't. 

 It's not agoraphobia - I'm not afraid  if I leave my house. I just don't want to. It  inevitably ends with some sort of triggered response to some stimuli. The idea of ""exposure therapy"" does more harm than good.  

It's not depression - I can get out of bed and engage (trust me, I know what depression is)

It's not panic attacks - it's overwhelm. 

So...my question is this:

**What happens after burn out?** Any research I attempt to do on burn out is frustratingly vague and the ""years to recover from"" platitude doesn't entail WTF one would experience during these years. Currently what I'm experiencing feels like an existential crisis. My past identity is gone and I'm fine (glad, even) with that - but what am I supposed to expect, to focus on, to work on, to imagine?  NT therapy's focus is to get through the trauma. To get back to what you were doing. I realize that's not a reality for me. I'm not going to revamp my resume and rejoin the workforce. I'm not going to be a PTA mom volunteering at my kids school. I'm not going to be June Cleaver with a perfect household (thank god, that was EXHAUSTING and not worth it). 

 Yet anything I can find on autistic burnout simply states it sucks, takes years to recover from, and...........?

I have an obscure google website with 25+ themes together like this and character details, etc,  but mainly use it as a way to organize all of the information. As the collection has grown,  I feel like these could benefit from being shared. So here's the first one I'm sharing. If you have a theme you'd like, feel free to reach out. 

Note: I do not speak Japanese. I use translation apps and my best judgement, so I am not claiming any of these to be correctly translated. Please (please please) don't roast me for being wildly wrong about the translation. Feel free to add the correct translation in a comment.

1220,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-05-25 18:10:15,amrjs,Had a meltdown in public for the first time in a while,"And knowing what it was helped. 

Yesterday I had barely slept and was the warmest day of the year so far, I chose the wrong clothes (too high neck and the cotton top was a bit too thick). The bus was too warm. Here I was already on thin ice. 

Got to uni and this alarm kept going off. We tried to have a seminar outside but it was loud, so we went inside again. I didn’t feel comfortable stimming too much and my nerves were fraught…

Bought lunch and the machine messed up my order… twice. But eventually I got it right. Picked a book up at the library and then went to look for a book for my dad because his birthday is next week. There I got the call I was dreading, but knew was coming, that I didn’t get a job I really wanted (they wanted me but someone else had more experience)…

The straw that broke the camel’s back was that I hadn’t gotten my summer schedule for my job despite them telling me I should’ve gotten it last week. Not getting this job made me severely anxious about not getting the schedule. You know how it is… they said something and it wasn’t happening, and and the uncertainty just had me in bits. 

I was crying so much and I couldn’t stop. Everything felt out of control and I was panicking. There had been too much noise and there were too many people. But because I knew what was behind it, that I was having a meltdown, I put on my sunglasses and put videos on with subjects that calm me, and I immediately went home. 

I couldn’t communicate, but I could get home and rest. By the time I came home I had my schedule… but it upsets me so much when someone says that I should get something within a specific week and it doesn’t happen that week. I’d rather get a vague timeline than that (I think) 

Knowing what it was helped so much to be able to tackle it.

1255,yes,MarkNarrations,2022-09-19 12:58:15,amrjs,wholesome story: a package that took months to arrive,"This took place 21-22 years ago in June/July. My family would travel every summer to England to visit my grandmother and dad's family who still lived there, for a while we would stay a week with my grandmother and would spend a week doing a roadtrip and spending time somewhere else in the UK. That summer we traveled up to Scotland and stayed somewhere in the northernmost Scotland (Inverness perhaps?), I was only 7 or 8 so I can't remember where exactly. 

As we traveled around we went somewhere touristy and I got a tartan patterned journal that I immediately wrote down my name and address in, just in case and because I wanted to practice. I also decided to write in in English, because we were in the UK, duh. This turned out to be a very good thing for the rest of the story... however, I did a pretty poor job of it...

We visited a lovely shop where we purchased a couple of thing, and left a couple of things behind. One thing was my journal, another thing was my older sister's pair of shoes (that she had been wearing!), and some other things we had bought there. Good thing to note: we were undiagnosed ADHD back then, so forgetting things everywhere was a bit of me and my sister's memo. We were, of course, sad these things were lost, but couldn't go back and get them for various reasons. We wrote it off as lost, like many things were when we were younger...

So we went back to Sweden, forgot about all of this... and then around October we got a big package delivered to us. We had no idea what it was about, except that the address was close to illegible, and it was from Scotland. When we opened it we found everything we had accidentally left behind!

The lovely store owners in Scotland had decided to send a pretty expensive package to Sweden, only my poorly written attempt at English and our home address had the package bouncing arount Switzerland (!!!) for months, before ending up in Sweden for a while until it finally ended up in the right hands (the stamps etc. were fun to read). So we got the things we bought, and forgot, and the things we lost (and forgot) back to us. 

It still makes me smile thinking about because they didn't have to send the stuff, and the post-offices that didn't give up and write the address off as a loss, and that they actually figured out where it was meant to go! So many people had to have taken the time to get it to us. Love it!

1259,yes,MarkNarrations,2021-07-30 15:47:31,amrjs,Rented out my apartment to someone who didn't flush the toilet... ever?,"So this happened a few years ago, back in 2018, but I still get frustrated thinking about it.

I lived in a student apartment but had just then finished my last course and was unemployed. Because the apartment was really expensive I decided to rent it out during the end of the lease period. I had rented it out previous years when I'd gone home to my parents to work for the summer, and it had worked out pretty well. It wasn't something I really liked doing, but I didn't have much of a choice.

After a while I decided to rent the apartment to a girl who was around 19, and about that time I got a job. 

All was, seemingly, going well... until I had to head over there for an evening to let an inspector into the apartment (pre-move out inspection). The apartment was messy, but I'm not the most tidy person so I didn't mind that. But, she had gone away for a few days and left poop sitting in the toilet. She hadn't flushed. So I had to clean up her poop before the inspector got there. Ew number one.

I texted her that it's important to flush the toilet, especially if you're going away. 

Anyway, my landlord contacted me and said that someone was interested in moving into the apartment at an earlier date, April 1st if I recall correctly, rather than the May 2nd that was previously decided on. I had told the girl this previously, and we had a contract that stated that I could give 1 month's notice if I had to have her leave the apartment earlier. She wasn't happy, but I understood because the housing market is terrible, and I was one of the few people who was renting at a fair price (I only asked for a little extra as apartment was fully furnished with my things).

This is when I try to arrange a meeting with her to have a key hand-over. I realize something sketchy is up, because I say that we can meet on the Friday, but she explains she can't. Okay, I worked late on thursday... so wednesday? We go back and forth, she tells me she's got the whole monday off and that works best for her, and again, I'm working late that day so I couldn't, but told her she could drop the keys off in the mailbox and we'll figure it out from there. I'm bracing myself for the worst.....

And, sure enough. She probably hadn't flushed her poop in weeks, somehow sugar had gotten stuck to the counters in the kicthens, the cabinets were sticky and oily, there was a layer of dust so thick that she couldn't have vaccuumed even once. I'd left cleaning supplies, including a vaccuum, for her to use. Nope. Again, giving her the benefit of the doubt, I shoot her a text feigning confusion saying ""are you coming back to clean?"" Of course, she was not. I didn't expect it to be super clean, but with the poop, the sugar, the residue on cabinets (and in the bathroom??) it was all too much. I told her I would be keeping the security deposit because I would have to spend a lot more time cleaning (I had to enlist my family to get it done in time) and couldn't take time off work to move bc I was so new at the job. 

She got so upset with me, saying she'd saved that money for xyz. Well... should've hired someone to clean then, not tried to avoid me so much that you didn't take that monday you had off to clean, etc. I just cannot imagine leaving your poop behind and think that that's okay. She tried to threaten me that she was going to get her money back, etc. but... it WAS in the contract that if she didn't leave it clean she'd lose her deposit. 

NEVER renting out again.

EDIT: I needed to move out as early as possible because I wouldn't have gotten any help moving if I kept the May1st move-out date, and that was the lastest possible move out date",5,2,2,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='oun5pm')>,,/r/MarkNarrations/comments/oun5pm/rented_out_my_apartment_to_someone_who_didnt/,,,False
1260,yes,EntitledPeople,2021-05-14 00:44:28,amrjs,A guy takes advantage of my twin with TBI by stealing a lot of money from her,"Trying to keep this a bit anonymous, but we'll see how this goes. 

This features my Twin, her Entitled Friend, and my whole angry family.

Back when my twin and I (28F) were 8 my twin got a brain tumor, and that plus the treatment after it, resulted in what is essentially a TBI. She's very trusting of people, she's got the maturity of a ~14 y/o, and it's impacted her congitive abilities (eg. IQ etc.). In our early 20s she started taking classes with other girls who had brain injuries of different kinds, because due to her brain damage she did not technically finish middle school. This school also had other classes for people who did not have this type of injury, and where able-bodied in all senses of the word, but just interested in a particular class this school offered.

At this school my sister made friends with a guy. I heard about him from time to time, though I did not like him because he was pushing her boundaries in ways that made her uncomfortable, but she was unable to set those boundaries for herself. One time after school they were hanging out, and she was taking money out of her account and he somehow was able to see her bank balance. Due to her disability she'd recieved compensation from her insurance, as well as a small amount of money each month that my parents helped her save for future expenses (she lived at home and we wanted to build a solid base for her in the future, because she's never expected to work a full-time job). What does an entitled person do? Ask for money.

This guy starts pulling a sob story, about being behind on rent and bills etc. And he ask to borrow money. A lot of it. I'm not going to say the amount but it was more than the average month's rent in this city. My sister told me that she felt off about it, and didn't want to, but because she's one of the kindest people you've met, and because she didn't know she could say no, or how to say it, she gave him the money. 

After, she texted me and I could feel the sadness and shame she felt for doing it. When she told me she'd given him a lot of money, I expected 1/3rd of what she gave him. It's been about 8 years and this still breaks my heart. I told her that she had to tell our mom, and she had to get the money back. Our mom was furious, because this entitled ""friend"" knew that my sister had a TBI, that she was unable to say no, and that she couldn't see why she should say no when he asked... and he asked her for that reason. 

My parents immediately contacted this guy to set up a payment plan, and threathened to go to the police if he did not pay. He did pay back a small sum of what he owed (I think it was 1/10th), and then we never heard from him again. We never went to the police, I think because we knew that we didn't actually have a case. She gave him the money, even though he manipulated a person he knew was vulnerable, and unfortunately there's no law that protects against that. 

Since then my twin has gotten better at asking questions, and has never lent money to a friend again. She's occasionally been stiffed on a movie ticket because she paid in advance and they never paid back, but that's nothing in comparison. She also knows we have her back. Since then she's studied hard in school, and actually has a job, now which is amazing! She's made it through a lot, and there's more than this one guy who's tried to use her cognitive disability against her, but this one really really took the cake and ran with it. 

I hope he's out there feeling guilty about taking money off of a disabled person. He better sit with that guilt for his whole life.",7,32,32,0.98,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='nbw6s4')>,,/r/EntitledPeople/comments/nbw6s4/a_guy_takes_advantage_of_my_twin_with_tbi_by/,,,False

In the mean time, I’ve found myself overanalyzing everything I do and think.

For whatever reason, whether I’m starting to unmask, notice my tendencies more, or I’m internalizing symptoms and signs of Autism, it seems like literally everything I do lines up with either common Autistic experiences or symptoms. The more I think on it, the more it feels like everything about me is caused by something, instead of just being who I am. My interests are stereotypical, I’m more aware of how oddly I move, I can’t stop overthinking my thought processes. Even in therapy, I’m more and more aware of how many of my problems can be explained by me being Autistic. I thought it would be a relief to have an explanation, but instead it’s brought up so much self doubt and insecurity that I can’t help but study everything I do.

Does anyone else get stuck in this loop? Is this typical for people who have just found out they’re neurodivergent?

Your signs and displays should never become the job of others to clean up.

I’m 24, AFAB, 5’5” and 230lbs. No physical prior conditions, but I’m diagnosed with Depression, Anxiety, and ADHD. I’m taking the Lamictal as a mood stabilizer for my Depression.

For medications, I’m currently on 10mg methylphenidate IR, 27mg methylphenidate ER, and my doctor is working with me to swap me from 20mg Fluoxetine to 20mg of Lamictal. I also take a combined birth control pill (Blisovi/Tarina FE 1/20). 

From my psych, I was told that the interaction between the bc and Lamictal would be minimal. From my doctor at Planned Parenthood, I was told that Lamictal can interfere with bc and make it less effective, and that I should use backup protection. From my pharmacist, I was told that my bc would be unaffected, but that I should take my Lamictal a few hours after my bc, because the estrogen would cause me to metabolize the Lamictal more quickly and I wouldn’t get the full effects. 

I’ve tried to look around online, but everything I read has a different conclusion about the interaction.

Both her and my therapist believe I’m on the spectrum (which is so validating, a part of me was scared I absorbed too much TikTok bs and was gaslighting myself into thinking I’m autistic), and it’s gotten me thinking more into things I’ve always attributed to my anxiety. 

I’ve always had (what I’ve been calling) panic attacks. More severe than my anxiety attacks, but they’ve never quite fit the description I hear of panic attacks. I don’t feel like I’m having a heart attack, I can breathe, I can always pinpoint exactly what and when set me off. It just…doesn’t line up with what everyone else’s panic attacks sound like. 

Instead of being a hardcore anxiety attack with more physical symptoms, I completely change as a person. I stomp around, I make odd sounds, I twitch and flick my head, I tend to yell and scream and get extremely frustrated, I can’t help but claw at my face and arms. If someone touches me, I’ll freak out. I’ve thrown things, I’ve flipped furniture, and it all only ends when I get to curl into a ball somewhere dark and quiet to decompress.

I’ve always been obsessed with weird names because of some of my family members, and this sub reminds me of them constantly, so I had to share. 

Everything boils down to my Great Aunt losing her mind after the death of her first husband. Supposedly, she watched him get killed by the mob, but I…kinda think she made that up when she lost it. Anyways, my Great Aunt legally changed her name to Meta Earthling. Somehow, despite being convinced that Bigfoot is an alien and saying that she’s friends with him, as well as how she’s been abducted by aliens several times, she went on to remarry and have a few kids. 

These poor, poor girls were doomed. They were named by a woman who, one Halloween, dressed as an alien with full chicken wings in her hair (the whole family had farms) and did acid because marijuana made her cough too hard. They never had a chance. So, the world was blessed with Vesta Light, Nova Lotus, and Reality. 

I complained a lot as a kid about never finding keychains with my name on them, but learning about my Great Cousins shut me up real good. 

I’ve never met my mom’s cousins, but have tried to look them up, and all of them changed their names after Meta died. Frankly, I can’t blame them. (EDIT: they didn’t change their names I just suck at google and couldn’t find them lol) Sometimes, I catch myself thinking that Reality sounds metal as hell, but I could never curse a kid with that name. 

So, does anyone else have incredible names in their families? Is it why you’re so amused by the names people come up with here?

I already have Odyssey and Origins in my sights, and have been looking into the older games. The newer AC games seem to be more open world than the early games, and the older games seem to be a lot more linear and focused on stealth, from what I’ve read. Don’t get me wrong, I love the stealth kills in the game, but I love having the option to just go crazy with my axe. 

I’ve seen mixed reviews for Valhalla from diehard AC fans, everything from saying it’s the best after Black Flag, to saying it’s one of the worst. From what I’ve read, it looks like Valhalla, Odyssey, and Origins are laid out in a different style than the originals, with more of an rpg, open-world focus. That’s usually the style of game I adore, so I’m a little skeptical about the og games. I want to get the full AC experience, but I also quit Dishonored because I suck at stealth. 

So, instead of relying on gaming journalists and dodging spoilers, I thought I would ask here. 

Experienced AC fans, how does Valhalla compare to the other games when it comes to gameplay? Are the first games open-world, or linear? Are you free to cause mayhem however you’d like, or are the missions more stealth centered?

My family owns a tea business with multiple brick and mortar locations. We have a ton of glass in the stores, everything from vintage tea cups, to tea pots, to mugs. Luckily, it’s super rare that anything gets broken, and everyone jumps to apologize and pay when something breaks. I’d say that I’ve had to deal with- maybe -three broken items, in the five years I’ve been full time in the shops. 

Recently, one of our locations had a woman and her daughter (confirmed for 21+, not a kid) come in. While they were there, the daughter picked up a ceramic mug with a ceramic lid, the lid fell on the ground, and it broke. She was mortified, and did pay for the broken product. She is not who I care about. 

The problem is her mom. Her mom, who has now gone into the location, noticed that there is no “You break it, you buy it” sign, or any signs that warn customers that glass breaks when dropped. The daughter doesn’t care, the mom is foaming at the mouth, though. She has decided to insist that, since we didn’t have any signage up, we set her daughter up to scam her out of $20 and she is threatening to sue. (I think she’s mentioned emotional damages)

I have found absolutely nothing that indicates that she’d be able to do such a thing, and want to laugh in her face, but I’m being told to cater to her every whim and to try to persuade her to not sue us. She’s blowing smoke, especially since she’s not the one who dropped and paid for the item, right? We’re an LLC, if it matters.

ETA: Thanks for the replies, everyone! I figured that she was just talking to try to ruffle my feathers, but wanted to make sure I wasn’t missing some obscure law where she’d drag us in court.

I have dealt with serious anxiety and mild depression since I was a child. I have been diagnosed with ADHD-c mostly off of extremely inconsistent school performance when I was a kid: if I found something interesting I could learn it easily and retain all the facts forever, but if something didn’t interest me I couldn’t  (and still struggle to) focus, I daydream constantly and looked for something that would interest or stimulate me. This involved destructivity and hyperactivity that would annoy my parents and teachers. I also had impulse control issues that nearly got me arrested several times that have gotten better but I still struggle to use any sort of social media appropriately. This all sounds like run of the mill ADHD, and ADHD meds help somewhat. 

But I have also always felt very uncomfortable in social situations, like I just don’t know how to act appropriately. My default were either over the top behavior that others found annoying (I learned to control that as an adult) or shutdown (in a corner by myself/fleeing). I can fake being normal for an hour or two but I hate it. So as an adult I don’t really socialize at all if I don’t have to and I really have no friends outside of my immediate family. I have 3 interests I am extremely obsessive about and I can’t imagine not being able to pursue them. I have a job that fits one of my interests and I am pretty good at it, but I try to find excuses to avoid socializing with
my coworkers. They are good people but it just feels awkward and stressful for me. 
I am also married with three kids, and my youngest and I are extremely similar. She was a really challenging child behaviorally since birth (just like I was) so we started seeing therapists and eventually a psychologist and at age 8 she was diagnosed with ASD without intellectual or language impairment. She is now 13 and the similarities between us are only more apparent now (with the main difference is she no longer has any violent outbursts that I continued to have until age 20).

My wife and other children are now convinced I have ASD either in addition to or instead of ADHD-C, and I suspect they are correct. 
My question for you all is do you think this is something worth pursuing with a psychiatrist? I realize it would be better for my family if I was less obsessed with my routine, and I do wish I had friends. I feel like I know how to make friends but what I have to do to make friends-hanging out, making small talk, planning things isn’t worth it. Basically the idea of changing the way I am and who I am at this point in my life is scary and I am resistant to it.

Growing up my language skills where borderline low and they refused my accommodations outside of speech therapy and OT I had no communication devices given.

 I went from talking a bit, to shut down entirely by the time I was a teenager I wasn't socializing and my language had not changed. I only recently started putting together the real story not some blurred memory of everything once my teacher in my adulthood gave me my old papers and we discussed the problems. 

Now I'm an adult (29) with poor education [They failed this to shocking] and lived my entire life up until recently not knowing why I could speak but was still struggling to get my words out and why I sometimes use the wrong words. Why I take so long to make a sentence that I want to make without messing it up. On the surface you probably wouldn't notice anything but once getting to know me you do. 
I type perfectly fine though, and my speech seems fine to but I can tell somethings wrong.  

I always could In my old pappers it stated i had a expressive language disorder. Today you'd call it a developmental language disorder. I knew I had taken speech but I never knew of the disorder that I had nobody told me I tried to write a post on this before but wasn't very clear with the problems but I was also very angry I'm calmer now but not happy.

Now that I know the problem I'm asking for help. I want to know as an adult if there is anything I can do because I'm sick and tired of being behind everyone else's speed when taking and I'm sick and tired of being stuck using the wrong words and being misunderstood. 

But I don't know what to do because i'm rural so there's almost nothing out here and what is out here is ABA. [Which no thanks they've done enough damage] I also have no idea who takes adults because most everyone here takes kids and ontop of this I do not drive or have support. But I'm frustrated and I'm tired of being frustrated. 

I know some people are probably going to be like well. What's the problem you can type?

1305,yes,DataHoarder,2022-02-13 22:16:08,reeper150,I found an indescribably important HDD that was thought to be lost forever!!!,"For background, when I graduated highschool in 2011 my father bought me a 1.5 TB HDD as a graduation gift. He put many movies on it for me to watch while I was away at college. He recently passed away. 

Between 2011 and 2016 I put everything of importance on that HDD. I majored in music performance in college and all of my performances, lessons, masterclasses, and practice sessions were recorded to a video camera and put on the drive. When I took time off from school and moved to Paris, I took over 10,000 photos that were all on the drive. I hoard rare Beatles recordings, and over 6,000 unique recordings of the Beatles playing were on the drive. I briefly worked as a flash game developer and sold my games to make a living. The games were all my own coding and artwork, and they were on the drive. Precious videos and photos of friends and family were on the drive. My favorite stand up comedy show, which has been out of print for over a decade was on the drive. And all of this just scratches the surface of what all was on that drive. 

6 years ago when I moved from my townhouse back to my family home due to health issues, the drive went missing. I was devastated beyond words. None of the data had ever been backed up due to both financial and logistical obstacles, and an ""It will never happen to me."" mentality. My grandmother had helped me pack up all of my stuff and clean my townhouse when I moved out. And I had also been letting my troubled younger brother live with me as well. As my grandmother couldn't identify a PC component to save her life and my brother stole and sold everything he laid his eyes on, I always figured that either she had thrown it away or he had stolen it. I have spent years bitterly obsessing over what happened to the drive and lamenting how I had lost so much of my life. 

Yesterday I had to take everything out of my storage unit because the floor was not installed properly and it had fallen in. Everything had to be pulled out, so that the company could replace the floor. It was a 7 hour endeavor to get everything pulled out and sorted. While sorting I found a green fabric bag that was tied shut. Out of curiosity I opened it. It had a brown paper bag folded inside of it. And I immediately assumed it was some decoration like a statue, and very nearly threw it in a box, but curiosity got the better of me and I opened the brown bag. As expected there was bubble wrap wrapped around something inside. As I pulled the bubble wrap off, I saw something unexpected though. It was an antistatic bag lined with foam. My stepdad was standing over my shoulder waiting to see what it was, and my mom was sitting a few feet away watching curiously as well. I peeled the bag back to see some kind of ports and my stepdad said what is it, to which I replied, ""Oh it's just an old video card."" Then I pulled it out of the bag and said ""No. It's a hard drive...... Wait! IT'S A HARD DRIVE!!! IS IT!?.... IT IS! IT'S THE HARD DRIVE I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR FOR YEARS!"" I jumped up and down like a little kid and almost started crying. Suffice to say that it spun up, everything was on it, nothing was corrupted, and it is all backed up to my 28 TB RAID that is currently syncing it all to my backup server. This is one of the happiest days I've had in a very long time.",121,1480,1480,0.98,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='srul5x')>,,/r/DataHoarder/comments/srul5x/i_found_an_indescribably_important_hdd_that_was/,,,False

$300 - $450 USD

Are you open to refurbs/used?

No

How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?

Main priority is performance in the sense that it can run 24/7 to host a small server and needs to be capable of handling a modest Windows 10 virtual machine. I have a tablet so I don't need a 2-in-1, and wouldn't use a touch screen at all either. Battery life and build quality do not matter at all.

How important is weight and thinness to you?

Not at all.

Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.

N/A

Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.

No.

If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?

N/A

Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?

Ethernet Port. At least 2 USB-A 3.0 or higer. 8 Gigabytes of ram minimum. Intel processor (i3 minimum)

Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.

For the sake of simplicity I will try to only provide relevant information. I pay for 500 Megabit/sec internet service. I have an ethernet cable that runs from my router to a network switch.

None of these devices have Wi-Fi enabled at all. The two faster devices are both cutting edge desktop PCs with brand new high-end parts. The slowest is an older laptop, which makes a bit of sense, but not 400 Mb/s difference sense. I am trying to get all 3 devices to that 450 Mb/s speed that the fastest desktop PC is getting. The ethernet cables are all identical except the faster PC has a longer cable because it is farther away from the switch. Aside from this length difference, the cables are exactly the same. They are all monoprice CAT7 patch cables. I am at a loss as to what could be causing this issue. I tried switching the network switch ports of the 150 Mb/s machine and the 450 Mb/s machine but the speeds stayed the same, so the ports have nothing to do with it. Can an ISP throttle a specific device on my network? I am at a loss and use these devices for work and need them running faster than they are. Any advice is appreciated. I am at a complete loss.

\-Overreact in many situations

\- Hate small talk

\-Fidgety

\-Rehearses social interactions in my head

\-Few friends

\-Hate phone calls

\-Very logic oriented thinking

\-I react well under pressure and changing circumstances

I should have seen it coming, but I’m still gobsmacked by the news.  Who would have expected him to take the leap so soon?

His spokesman today says he will renounce his Norwegian citizenship sometime next week and has already been approved for US citizenship under the Extraordinary Individual clause.

Magnus is close friends with New Yorker and YouTuber, Levy Rozman (Gothamchess) which he said was a huge part in him going through with it and why he chose New York as his home.  Also New York overtook Moscow’s title this year as the most competitive chess city in the World, which almost certainly factors in to Carlsen’s choice.

In Norway Magnus was a big fish in a small pond; it was just a matter of time before he needed to spread his wings.  Not to mention the US is home to many greats like Bobby Fischer, and contemporaries like Hikaru Nakamura and Fabiano Caruana, you can’t blame him for desperately wanting to represent Team USA.

There seems to be a strong human instinct to believe in a higher power, and I think aliens are quickly becoming a proxy for this in a society with declining religiosity.  I’ve seen people become outright hostile with me just for saying we don’t know if aliens exist.  They call me arrogant and naive for questioning the authorities.  Carl Sagan and Neal deGrasse etc invested their whole life to this work so of course they are going to exaggerate their certainty.

1405,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-05-25 17:16:12,Independent-Alps7271,Isolation feels easier,"
I’m NB afab and 28. I realized I was on the spectrum a few years ago but am only now starting to accept it. It’s so lonely. I know no other autistic ppl. I know that could potentially help but I’m so exhausted and depressed. Sorry it’s a long one, there’s a tldr below. 

It’s not that I can’t find joy in some interactions it’s that I have to wade through so much anxiety and confusion to hit upon enjoyment. It makes interacting feel scary and not worth it. I live alone and don’t work and leave the house on average once  a week (this has gotten more inconsistent) for groceries and to do laundry at my moms. My sister also lives there. I have no adult friends besides them and a new one (my first one that’s not family) I’ve been solely texting because in person is too hard. Even with her I told her I had to take a break due to issues with isolation. 

I really love my mother and sister. I don’t know what I would do without them and their support. I like my new friend, she’s so kind and funny! But interactions always feel…well bad. 

I’m able to unmask at times with all of them but I usually end up feeling ashamed and confused about even being a person? Like hearing my voice can be nails on a chalkboard but I compulsively keep speaking and seeking reassurance (I also have OCD) then just spiral. I always cry around them and get ‘existential’ as they may say. I’m just so depressed and confused about myself and life it’s all I can focus on. I think of it as an unstoppable overflowing. It has to come out and I’m powerless to stop it. I feel like I’m too much and not enough constantly. I feel like nobody knows me and my pain. I just want to fix it maybe but obviously talking doesn’t help. Makes it worse honestly but I can’t stop. 

I feel Infantilized often. Even though I know it’s not intentional and there’s no Ill will behind it, obviously it still hurts. As if I’m just a little baby who just doesn’t get how to be a person yet. But I feel I’ve never known. 

With my new friend I struggle to feel I’m enjoying our friendship even though I know I like her and the things we talk about. My body just feels so tense when speaking with them and after interactions I pick them apart endlessly worrying I did something wrong. I always think I did something wrong and ppl just won’t tell me. Reading between the lines is exhausting. I’m struggling not to break it off out of fear and exhaustion. 

TLDR: It feels easier to isolate. I’m incredibly in my head all the time when alone and it’s hell but it feels like a “hell you know” type of thing. It’s preferable to the strain of interaction. 

I feel like I never know what is expected of me!! I’m simply tolerated. I feel like I’m in a damn play and don’t know my lines. I know I’m loved but I don’t feel loved. That I’m a black hole and it just gets lost in me. I feel like nothing. Nobody. 

I don’t know what I’m posting this for except desperation and a potential for advice. I feel so lost and lonely. If anyone has similar experiences please share.

If I like you i don't care what are in your pants, I'm only interested in you as a human being and depending on your own preferences and your equipment we will do diferent things. On the other hand, if I had understand correctly some people only feel atracted sexually to someone when their gender are align with an specific kind of private parts.

Only talking about physycal preferences, we know that you can't choose what atracts you and what not, if you don't feel sexually atracted to redheads or people with green eyes that can't be help it. That can be tremendously superficial and shallow but not morrally incorrect, the same way that a lesbian girl can't suddenly being atracted to men. We know  that a  person's genitals do not determine their gender, we all can agree with that so therefore my question.

It’s taking a toll on our relationship.","My (39M) partner of 3 years is suspected to be autistic by our couples therapist that he hasn’t gone to in about a year but I still see. He shows many characteristics the biggest ones being a very negative reaction to intense emotions (especially mine) to the point that he literally physically runs away from me, and hypersensitive to any real or perceived criticism. ANY … it’s impossible to have a conversation with him about anything negative even when I try as hard as I can to use all the communication tools I’ve learned in therapy. He usually blows up and if the topic is specifically triggering he becomes verbally abusive. 

I (34F) am diagnosed ADHD and have my own triggers and issues, especially with rejection sensitivity which is the icing on the cake since he is minimally affectionate and while most days I know he loves me, it’s very difficult to actually see it. 

Anyway, I’ve spoken to him several times about my concerns for him as well as for what it’s doing to us as a couple and he’s just not having it. He refuses to go to a psychiatrist or even back to therapy with me. When we first went to therapy it was going well until it started bringing up feelings for him he just could NOT handle. 

We’re both Latinos which adds another layer of stigma to mental health which plays a huge part in his reluctance, since any kind of neurodivergence is seen as “crazy” and “lack of motivation” that can easily be fixed with faith and determination so that doesn’t help the situation at all. Not to mention it makes it nearly impossible for him to understand MY issues and MY meltdowns at all. I recognize he doesn’t have the tools yet to understand or manage it but it’s really hurting me. 

I know that inevitably if this doesn’t get any better I will need to walk away, but I would really like to find a solution. He was my best friend and has been my ideal partner in every way and I just don’t know how to move forward from here. I know if he doesn’t want to help himself there’s not much I can do and that it’s not my responsibility to do so, but I would really like to find a way.

1423,yes,lostgeneration,2022-10-18 15:38:53,cyborgmonkey-,Update to dental work in Mexico.,"Brief update to my prior post. For those who asked, yes I came to Tijuana. I will post more details on the dental office as I get further along.

Yesterday I flew in to San Diego. A car service drove me to the dentist, then for a ct scan, then back to the dentists, then to my room. My biggest complaint is just that it was a long day and I feel lonely by myself down here. I have major social anxiety so this is way way way outside my comfort zone but the dentists and staff have been so understanding and welcoming.

Yesterday they took molds for the new dentures. Sure enough they found bone fragments that gentle dental had failed to remove. They also took before photos and will take after ones so I will post those at that time and started preparing the dentures and adjusting for size and fit. I got to pick out my tooth color and length, and I believe they are adjusting for a more pronounced underbite than I used to have. I was so tired from traveling and heat and anxiety that I was really depresses when I finally got to the motel. A long nights sleep was much needed.

The entire staff and drivers are all great and even though I can't wait for the comforts of home I know already that this was the right call. A rough few days to end years of suffering.

Thanks all for your support! It's especially helpful right now. My wife would have come with me but because we live in the US we would lose income and child care for the week which we cannot afford.

Luckily I believe I am in good hands and further believe that this was the right call. It is more and more apparent how the US dentists are a joke who just draw the process out to pad their bottom line.

I am going to get glasses while I am here and maybe even have them lock at a few other issues too since health care is so much more accessible here.",16,80,80,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='y7afef')>,,/r/lostgeneration/comments/y7afef/update_to_dental_work_in_mexico/,,,False
1424,yes,lostgeneration,2022-10-13 22:00:49,cyborgmonkey-,I just scheduled dental work in Mexico. I have feelings.,"My family has bad teeth. My boomer dad didn't want money ""wasted"" on medical bills for me. I got fed a constant diet of sodas and didn't learn the importance of caring for them. So about 5 years ago I noticed major cavities and pain developing. The dentists have been so expensive. They want to fix this bit or that bit while they all continue to rot away and the pain gets worse now matter how many times I've said to just pull them all!!! 

They also want to treat me like a junkie and refuse me pain medicine for the pain they could fix by actually pulling the teeth like I said to do years ago.

Even when I got my lower teeth pulled the dental assistant was actively hostile. Slamming things around, heavy sigh when I accepted the dentists offer of nitrous. Then the asshole turned it on max and ignored me asking for a reduction until I ripped the thing off.

Every doctor says pain meds are someone else's problem AND that they can't fix anything without a million damn appointments.

I was up last night in pain. Crying. Hating dentists and doctors and US ""healthcare."" What a fucking joke.

I'm desperate and even though I live in the richest country on the world no one will actually help now. 

I called a dentist on Mexico. I'm going to spend 8 days alone in a foreign country while undergoing procedures and a can't fucking wait just to be out of pain.

Not only that, but the whole trip, including airfare, hotel, teeth pulling, and new dentures, will be cheaper than JUST the teeth pull in America. It is going to get me out of pain faster and save me thousands.

Thank god we don't have universal healthcare where we might have to wait to see a doctors or pay more. Edit: Sarcasm.

My country does literally nothing in the interest of helping or protecting me or my family So no I'm not proud to be American. I'm fucking embarrassed and pissed.

Edit. I can't keep up with the responses but am reading them. Thank you all! And yes I am being sarcastic about universal healthcare.

1442,yes,pnsd,2022-02-21 01:38:31,cyborgmonkey-,Why can't I believe I have cptsd and ptsd?,"Hey folks. My first post here. Need some help. My mom was covert narc. My dad was a sadistic one. His abuse was easy to see. My mom played a victim/hero and gaslit me on so many things while playing this hero for ""protecting"" me from him. There were also 3 older kids from his side and 7 from hers. They got plenty messed up too. Unfortunately too much to be healthy for me to be around now. They use similar manipulations and I've never had any moments of real connection with any of them. With exception of 1 brother when I was young. No ill will to him but we aren't in touch. Dads kids resented me cause I didn't get beat. Hers resented me for getting attention from her. Also the closest was 7 years older lived with his mom mostly (sadly she was awful too). Sorry this is so long. There's just so much.

So I'm the golden child, baby, resented, alone, and my job is pretty much to absorb her limitless need for attention. Meanwhile I am basically invisible and I know it is not right but my reasoning like partitions itself off. At nearly 40 went NC with ALL but the brother. Best holidays with my wife and kids, not stress, but sadness though. Therapy, meds, emdr. Previously I've been in therapy for 3 years with 2 IOP trips and permanent marks left from self injury. Doing better.

But...

I can't say I have ptsd. I have recurring dreams going back 2 years. Constant emotional flashbacks. I had body dysmorphia from her. Medical neglect. So so many examples to prove it. But nothing scares me more than being like he. What if I'm the delusional one? What if I'm totally self unaware? I also hang up on others like my brother who had it worse (probably?) How can I complain when so many have had so much worse? 

I just want to get past, move on, stop hitting panic any time I start to sleep because I will ""be back there."" And stop triggering all day. I don't even feel like I deserve to cry about it.

I know this is intended to promote fairness but it only makes everything worse. While my daughter was young and I was eager to secure stable employment I worked in an agency as a temporary employee.

That’s just the state cost though. Then there are the employees being rejected needlessly to satisfy their quotas.

That ends up $60 plus 25%, or $75 per hour!!! Three people, three working days of eight hours each and you have that times 24, or $1800 for an interview where they have no intent on considering anyone else.


That’s just the state cost though. Then there are the employees being rejected needlessly to satisfy their quotas. Those people spend time and money going to interviews, they get their hopes up, and then they get them dashed over and over. That bears a psychological burden and a complete mistrust of the employer.",0,12,12,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='s381jl')>,,/r/recruitinghell/comments/s381jl/mandatory_minimum_interviews/,,,False
1450,yes,raisedbynarcissists,2022-01-13 19:28:40,cyborgmonkey-,Boring nightmares and flashbacks?,"I’ve been diagnosed with CPTSD by a couple of different therapists and doctors. Both of my parents were extreme narcissists. My mom was covert, so her abuse was more subtle, and my dad was just an asshole and proud of it. It’s been years of therapy and medications. I finally went fully NC not just with them but also with my equally damaged siblings. I had been their black sheep target of abuse for years. 


For about a year or two now I have been having these strange recurring nightmares. It started with insomnia, then these extremely vivid dreams that would be erased from my memory almost immediately.  But after more than a year of them I’ve gotten enough snippets to know that they are dream recreations of various stages of my youth and young adulthood. The dreams themselves are all innocuous like getting groceries or something mundane, but there is always this sense of despair. I know that there are some that are scary or intense somehow because they wake me up when I try to fall asleep but I can’t recall anything of them whatsoever. I realized that I spend half the day dreading having to sleep again.


On top of that I have little split second flashback memories with the same despair emotion all day long. These memories can be of dreams, or real memories, but they always just suck emotionally no matter how bland the memories are.


I’ve been undergoing EMDR therapy so I assume that is stirring stuff up. I really wish I could find a way to get an understanding of these dreams and move on. I want to enjoy my life now instead of being stuck in the past that I hated.

1456,yes,raisedbynarcissists,2021-11-24 16:47:20,cyborgmonkey-,I went no contact. I feel so much better.,"It was about the third time she brought up my 8!!!! year old son’s weight, always because she was trying to “help” since “other” people could be mean. I already had to overcome body dysmorphia myself. That alone had me ready to cut contact. Then in the same conversation she said “I’ve never been critical” and I laughed out loud. She acted offended. I started calling out things she had done including the bs comments about my son’s weight, just like she had done with me. I had previously started compiling a list of various mean comments and things they had done to me. With her it was covert so it took me until now, nearly 40, to see the extent of the damage. I went to the list and just started listing stuff off to her. I kid you not it was like the scene in the movie where the shapeshifter is dying and shifting through all the forms it took. She went to tactic after tactic after tactic just getting more and more desperate when I didn’t take the bait. 

At last I said “Don’t expect a call.” Hung up. Blocked her number. Then I sent a text to my narcissist dad and told him he had never once acted like an actual loving father and that I was blocking him too.

That was it. I felt free, like I could breathe, but I also felt guilt, particularly toward her, because that had always been her favorite hook to use. I would wonder if she was upset, but I would also think that she is probably absolutely giddy inside from the drama she can milk out of it with her friends. Then I’d think of the damage she would do to my son given the chance and I would get angry and more determined. Even if I felt some guilt I had no choice when it came to defending him.

My wife was very supportive right from the get go. She never liked them and hated how they acted to me and although she saw the abuse she knew I was too stubborn if pushed and she patiently waited for me to see it. God bless her for that! I have a friend from when I was young who saw the abuse first hand and was supportive. My in-laws have been kind and loving and make sure I know I am part of their family. I also have a great therapist, mental health nurse practitioner (I just call her a psychiatrist because she is actually better).

I’m fortunate to have all that. I wish everyone did. They and the list helped me in moments of doubt, and I’ve continued to add to it.

It has been several weeks or a month since I went no contact. The first few days I felt like I could breathe for the first time ever. I did struggle with guilt as I mentioned. I also struggled with sadness and grief. I had finally let go of expecting them to ever change. I had to grieve for that loss of hope.

Now however, I am starting to feel much better. My wife sees it too and tells me I look healthier, stand straighter, express my needs constructively, and just generally have more confidence and more willingness to be myself. My compulsive spending even went down.

I literally look up more. Walking out of the local store I’d be looking at the car or the ground. Now I walk out and I see the mountains and misty clouds and sky.

It was a drastic step but it was the right one. Society constantly tells us that we can’t do that. That we have to put up with it. We don’t. I hope those of you who read this and need to take that step will find the strength and support to pull through it. For those who have done it and still struggle I hope you find relief.

I wrote this post in hopes that it could bring hope to those of you facing this decision. I’m not saying it is always the right call, but if you need to make it you should not beat yourself up.

All through childhood. They would yell and scream, my mom would come tell me all about how mean my dad would have been to me. Then she would lean on me for emotional support.

On the other hand if I expressed anger or sadness it was always immediately dismissed as unimportant.

My wife is soooo glad they are gone, but sad for what I'm going through,

Despite what I logically know emotionally I'm not there. I question and doubt myself. But then  always come back to the countless nasty things they've done and said.

They're divorced now. He is off playing as though he did nothing wrong, and she has still been trying to lean on me for all her emotional needs. She gave me body dysmorphia and was aready trying to be ""helpful"" because she was ""concerned"" about my 8 year old sons weight.

While I've been on disability and in and out of IOP she still wants to tell me every sad detail of every person she knows and every illness they have and how sad it makes her.

Regarding my dads abuse when they divorced, she said ""I was abused for 30 years.""

I replied ""Yeah me too.""

And then she said ""Well at least your young and still have lots if your life left.""

Total dismissivness of the pain they caused me. 

She also gaslights and considers herself a saint so she can't understand why I could possibly be mad at her. It's so frustrating questioning my sanity when i know for a fact I'm not crazy and other people saw and said the same things about her.

So in trying to tame the guilt I think over these things and get angry. Then I just feel both.

“You're just like your father!”

“You’re just like your mother!”

These were never good comparisons.

If one half was bad, and the other half was bad, did that mean I was just bad? 

I remember being pulled from bed at night, after the usual yelling, and taken with my mother to her friends house. “Are you going to get a divorce?” I don’t know how old I was, but I knew what it meant.

“No sweetie, it was just a bad fight.” I felt such disappointment.

“I wish you would.” 

Then she was away, detailing all the drama to her friend. I could hear them talking, light coming in from the hall.  Her friend collected porcelain clowns. There were shelves lining the walls. Dozens of creepy clowns, a strange bed, more fighting but no hope for an end. It was the bright moon that comforted me.

Ten older siblings. Three from his prior marriage, and seven from hers. His were regularly beaten, hers were neglected or used for her emotional support. Most were already adults and scattered to the wind. There are none that I trust.

I remember being alone in the woods. Him and a truck, his usual scowl. We picked up my brother from a camp. They fought about me. There were only two seatbelts, so that meant I was loved better. I don’t blame my brother. He was a kid. 

When he ran, he was chased down and beaten, then dragged back to the truck where he asked “What about my bloody nose?”

“Use your sock.” 

These are my very first memories. My introduction to the world. 

Of my siblings, the seven on her side were the oldest, then the three on his, and then me, between the two of them. My previously mentioned brother was the closest in age. He spent some time with us, and some with his mother. I was somehow the youngest, and yet also an only child, with siblings who felt more like aunts and uncles.

He couldn’t beat me like he could his prior kids, but he did beat them in front of me. I’m sure they felt resentment. With her kids it was the fact that we had money and they had been poor. Either way I was the lucky “golden” child, left alone to watch it all fall apart, to be clung to by one and despised by the other, to be a nephew or brother whenever it was convenient, to be treated like a child and held accountable like a man, to nurture her wounds while enduring his since the time I could talk.

He was drunk and angry. They would yell and slam doors. There would always be disagreements about me. Then she would come and cry and tell me all the mean things he would have said and bask in the glory of protecting me from him.  All while I was comforting her.

I cry every day and desperately want to self harm.","I had a breakdown a few years ago when I was evacuated from my home due to a wildfire, while I got a call and told I lost a promotion to much newer employee who had quit and only been back two months. I don't remember the actual start of the self harming, but I was somewhere in that time. I think right after the call. It went on for months. Went to my boss for help, they forced me off work while I went through intensive and dialectical behavioral therapy. I returned to work, had a few issues, had to med change, went through intensive again, then I came back again. I started to stabilize, right as COVID hit.

I've hung in there. Haven't self harmed or been terribly depressed. Hadn't really wanted to. Still have been bored with the job though, which is part of the problem.

Now as winter sets in my boss, who I liked, is temporarily replaced with the guy who got the promotion at the start of it all. Added to that the guy replacing him is young and super new. He knows so much less than me about the job it is infuriating.

Supposedly this if for three months. I'm worried the boss I like will leave permanently. I can't work for these people like this. I am too bitter and angry and mad at myself. I have more experience, I have a degree. I'm not denying I've had issues but I was also jerked around a lot. I've never been promoted and my degree is just a big waste of money. I'm approaching forty and it has just made me angry. I told myself I didn't care anymore but seeing this kid be my ""senior"" just kills me.

I know I should be grateful to just have a job and be essential. And I am. But that's also part of the problem. I'm in a small town and need expensive meds. This is pretty much my only employment option.

So I'm trapped in this emotionally painful situation where I feel this awful combination of anger and sadness that makes me desperately want to self harm.

The honest to god only reason I am not doing it right now is because I cannot think of a way to hide it from my wife. I know that's a good thing but I am in so much emotional pain. I don't know any way to let it out. I cry every day on my way to work, or at work. I'm angry all the time. I can't even talk to my boss I liked who understood me, at least somewhat, because she isn't around and her replacement is the trigger.

My breakdown was too public. Now I'm doomed to be the office crazy guy who wasted money for a degree that would never matter. And I can't even get away from that.

I'm just so tired of feeling worthless and insignificant. Like a failure and a loser. Twenty years and a degree and I can't do something a young twenty year old can. What does that say about me?

My 12 year old son told me the other day that he is trans and would like to become female.

I just want to make sure he is 100% there before he starts any physical transition.

I encouraged him to join a group on here. My wife and I want to get him a few sessions with a therapist so he can talk to an unbiased professional.

1483,yes,work,2020-10-01 07:23:17,cyborgmonkey-,"Racist, Homophobic, and Islamophobic (relatively new) coworker is making me hate work.","I'm pretty much completely new to reddit so sorry if I do things wrong. I just have to find somewhere to let this out.

I work in law enforcement, but I'm not a police officer or sheriffs deputy. Nothing so glamorous. I am a weighmaster. I am one of the guys who sits in the little shacks on the side of the freeway and writes tickets to truck drivers if their truck is overweight or something like that. I don't carry a weapon and my interactions are all civil. The worst I can do to someone is write them a ticket or put them out of service for a short while (which can only be done for very specific reasons like a suspended license for example, I can't just decide to do it).

So anyways, I am a straight white agnostic male. I have no problem with anyone's race, religion, or sexual orientation. My job doesn't require a degree but I have one. I was majoring in religion and philosophy but had to change to business when I changed schools. I still took many classes on world religions. American truck drivers come from all over the world, so I find it interesting to meet the many types of people. 

Unfortunately, many of my coworkers harbor prejudices. I've always managed to side step talk of politics or religion. I've worked here for 8 years, so I'm third in line in terms of seniority but because of a fairly public breakdown a few years back I'm destined to not ever be promoted.

So I have no authority over my coworkers, but sometimes I help train them. 

This girl has been here for a little over a year. She already kind of drives me crazy because she is just constantly interrupting me with questions, many of which she should know the answers to by now, and others that aren't even work related (like for advice on her husbands unemployment claim because I used to work at the employment department.) Sometimes she calls me over and over, like 5 times in 45 minutes. Making it frustrating when I'm trying to do my job. And sometimes, she wants to talk about things like politics.

She want's to complain to me about her son being taught a tiny bit about Islam in a history class. 

She told me she doesn't mind my more feminine looking lesbian coworker, but used an offensive term to describe one with shorter hair, who actually happens to be straight.

She doesn't like it when people have accents and says things like ""it's nice when they speak English for a change""

Social distancing? No way! This girl is so close it would make me uncomfortable under normal circumstances.

Today I was helping train her and I saw how she acts with someone who is white, versus someone of color. She was just tearing in to this poor Indian gentleman who had simply made an honest enough mistake.

I finally had enough and interrupted her to answer the man's questions since she wasn't answering them and was just, I don't know, getting off on her power I guess.

Afterwards she told me ""You're too nice.""

I responded, ""That's because it works.""

I know how this goes. If I go to management they just kill the messenger. I am actually considering trying to change my shift just to get away from her.

(I literally just had to go dry heave over the toilet just from writing this out) My anxiety is off the charts and her bigotry isn't even pointed at me.",10,8,8,0.9,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='j33z0s')>,,/r/work/comments/j33z0s/racist_homophobic_and_islamophobic_relatively_new/,,,False

We saw a light coming from far out on the sea near the horizon. In just a few seconds it was at the shore and flew up (out of the water?) and continued above the land at the same speed until it disappeared behind a building. My wife and I both saw it. It was wavering up and down slightly almost as though it was a light on a dogs collar but it was moving way to fast. The only logical explanation I can think is maybe it was a drone photographing the resort at night.

Some other weird light things with me. 3 times as a young adult I awoke in the morning to see a streak of light fly at me impacting my forehead (3rd eye?) and physically knocking me over.

Around the time of the beach incident I witnessed a massive meteor burn up on entry and light up the whole night sky. 

In the last week I've seen a shooting star and 3 star like objects moving but to fast for a shooting star and too slow for a satellite. 2 were moving perpendicular to each other. One changed speed and direction. (High altitude aircraft maybe?)

I don't get people, I try but I don't understand how they're minds work and used to try to fit in but never did. I had some trauma in my early 20s that made me stop trying and since then I have lived alone with very little social communication. I find people scary I will avoid them irl because I'm scared of offending them and it turning confrontational, in that instance I will either lock up like my operating system crashed or just loose the ability to think straight making me talk loud/erratic.


I started painting models a couple of years ago and felt I did a ok job for a beginner but had nobody (friends or family) to ask if I was being bias over my own work, so I joined reddit. I posted my work and the response I had was overwhelming, I had never had positive reinforcement like that from anyone but my own mother, I literally cried with joy (it still makes me overwhelmed to think of it).

It was through my new found hobby and the kind people of reddit I eventually started to open up to people, I was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder in my early 30s and joined so I joined a reddit sub for social anxiety. It was in that sub someone surgested I may have undiagnosed Autism and suggested I took some online test.

I took those test and scored very high on them suggesting a high possibility I have some form of Autism. Since I did them (a couple of months ago) I have spent every day obsessing over what Autism is and reading/watching/listening to any information I can get.

I come to the point where I need to go see a doctor and ask for a referral to a specialist but I don't want to waste the time of a already overwelmed NHS. What if I'm not Autistic and I am just the broken thing I have accepted myself to be. I should imagen the assessment process is expensive and I don't want to waste resources on me that could help somebody in more need.

I'm sorry if I offended anyone with anything I said in this post, that was not my intention so please forgive me if I did. I have never been good at social communication. If I did offend anyone for any reason please feel free to let me know what I did wrong and how I could possibly improve myself and my understanding.

I told my parents yesterday.

I told my sister, and she congratulated me on the diagnosis. But she’s usually the only person that I can actually talk to about stuff and vice versa.

1. Do mandalorians often work as mercenaries? 
2. How would they actually build the Death Star? It’s the size of a small planet itself right?
3. How come these droids never told anybody what they already knew? Technically, Luke did ask who leia was. (I mean the C-3PO and r2 ones)
4. If leia was a political dignitary how come she couldn’t call for help when the troopers showed up in the beginning? And how are they supposed to get away with blowing up a planet?
5. If they blew up Alderan planet, how do they ever read the plans?

I’ve always been very ‘sensitive’ and it’s been an issue for others. I’m mostly good at glossing over for other people’s sake. I can have a couple good weeks in a row especially during the warmer/brighter months of the year. But then something unimportant happens and the emotional meltdown is horrible for me. 

I honestly hate it so much. It makes me insanely jealous of ’even keeled me’ or happy me’ from the week before. It’s like living with a really good roommate and then suddenly having to move in with an awful new neighbor. And because I can’t force them (my intense emotional reactions and negative feelings) to move out, I have to live with them in my head.  Also because I do so much work to minimize the burden on other people, I end up internalizing a lot of it. 

I hate feeling so out of control and having to hide it because (insert here: coworkers, family, friends, etc.) would be inconvenienced by a visible/audible meltdown. But I think it would actually be so much easier for me to process and let go of if I could just let it be instead of suffering in silence.

I started to gently lick his shaft but then he rammed it all the way down my throat! I gagged and tried to breathe around him but he said he needed to fuck me good before he left for work so that I would feel him all day long. 🤤

I tried real hard to lick his balls while he fucked my face to get him ready for my pussy like he wanted me to. At that point I didn’t need it since I was already dripping wet.

I don’t think he meant to do it so hard but once he felt how wet I was, he spread my legs further and told me I needed to get fucked like a slut. So he did. I just needed to cum so bad. He tells me all the time that he likes my pussy because it’s deep and tight, that way he can bottom out inside me.

He pounded me so deep that I thought I couldn’t take it anymore. But then he grabbed my throat and squeezed, telling me he was fucking me how I needed to be fucked. That made me cum so hard. 🫢I think I passed out when he decided to cum on my face, because when I woke up he was already playing video games. I’m sore but I feel amazing. 

Before he left I kissed his cock and balls and told them to have a great day.

He told me to assume the position so I started sucking him off. In the last few months I’ve become like obsessed with deepthroating him. He started describing a scenario where other couples watched us and fucked their brains out while he fucked me and it was incredibly hot. 

We had sex again after I got him hard while he talked about how I would be filled with dildos and plugs while he fucked my face.

He feels like I don’t take responsibility. But if there’s no list for me to complete, I can’t do the things. I am not helpful enough. 

I remember to bathe my daughter because she needs to be bathed every other day, I remember to feed her because it’s every 3hours or she cries.

Destroyers as the picket-specialized ship class, focus on shields too, stack evasion as much as you can

Friggates as torpeders and borderline suicide-ships. Focus on whatever is cheapest for armor, and evasion

Corvettes as... brawlers, i think..? Medium ranged weapons, cheap armor, focus on evasion

If i have X battleships, i try to have X cruisers, 2X destroyers, X friggates and X corvettes.

My reasoning is that battleships still do the thick of the damage, but needs an escort against small torpeders, so the destroyers protect them from missiles, and the cruisers kill enemy torpeders.

I’ve always preferred just to be comfortable rather than stylish. I suffer from extreme discomfort with tight, restrictive clothing, and constantly being hot and sweaty.

My impression is that many people are almost offended when you don’t dress a certain way for a particular occasion. Work and formal events in particular.

With regard to work, the last few years has been great because I can work from home and wear anything I want. Shorts, T-shirts, shoes optional, (naked from the waist down if I really feel like it…). I still get the job done and I’m perfectly comfortable and at ease. I don’t have to constantly re-tuck my shirt, feel restricted by belts and tight shoes, etc.

But why is it that when I have to work from the office I’m expected to spend an hour ironing my clothes, wear a tucked in collared shirt, dressy shoes, … to do the exact same thing that I do at home? And everyone just goes along with this unnecessary formality without questioning it. Do NTs actually not mind this?

Where I live, the climate is constantly very hot and humid, but that doesn’t stop people insisting on wearing suits to formal events, work functions and the like. Suits are designed for cold (European) weather, not harsh subtropical climates. Again, it’s completely illogical but almost everyone just goes along with it.

Formal events are a nightmare for me.

It was only in the last year that I started to seriously consider the possibility that I might be on the autism spectrum, so recently I sought out a clinical psychologist who made a formal diagnosis.

After a lot of reflection, there is no doubt that the social anxiety I have always experienced is a direct result of being autistic and all the challenges that go with that (struggling to socialise, form and maintain friendships, being socially awkward, etc.)

I’m wondering if anyone has been in this situation before? Now that I have an explanation/validation for the way that I feel, I am less inclined to see the need to treat the social anxiety and instead just embrace that autistic part of my brain. In other words, care less about trying to fit in and live an overly sociable life, which previously I thought I had to. Therefore, I’m considering gradually tapering the Lexapro to zero and see how it goes.

I have been getting help with social anxiety over the last year, but recently have begun to think that the anxiety is something secondary, and that the underlying cause of it is possibly being on the spectrum. My parents investigated this when I was very young, around 4-5 years old, but the outcome was either inconclusive or did not come up with any diagnosis.

At this point, I’m basically 50/50 on the possibility that I have high functioning autism. My GP agreed that there is a possibility I would be on the mild end of the spectrum, and supported my decision to get formally assessed.

However I have some concerns about getting diagnosed as an adult. The older I have become, the more well adapted I have become to all the complexities of forming relationships, success at work, etc. and being self aware enough of my autistic traits that I am able to mask this to ‘fit in’. I wonder just how sensitive/adaptive the testing is to this? I fear that I would struggle to really display or communicate to the psychologist the true struggles that I have faced my whole life, because of the success that I have had in masking a lot of these traits. At the same time, I would really value an objective professional opinion and I do not want to ‘persuade’ them either way.

I have been dealing with social anxiety for several years now, beginning in childhood but becoming very pronounced around age 19 when I started university, which was a big change from the safe, familiar environment of school. I was always avoidant of social situations, especially in large groups, loud environments or with new people. I would need to constantly prepare myself before social situations by ‘rehearsing’ scenarios beforehand, and using alcohol and other substances such as phenibut to take the edge off. I pushed through nonetheless, and tried to ‘fake it’ for a long time, and still managed to have a fairly normal social life and career. But recently it became harder to deal with, including feeling the physical effects of anxiety such as GI issues, hands shaking, difficulty keeping eye contact, etc. I went to my GP who recommended I see a psychologist and begin with Lexapro.

Benefits

So far the effects have been subtle but noticeable in some ways. Overall I feel calmer and my mood has improved somewhat. My mind is less frenzied. Thoughts that previously would have kept my mind racing now seem to subside within a few minutes and no longer keep me up at night or immediately occupying my mind first thing in the morning. I recently went to a NYE function with a new group of people, and not only did I feel much more comfortable but I was more talkative than usual, despite not drinking much. I feel like I can just go at my own pace without worrying about what might happen in the future. My noisy neighbours kept me awake the other night, which would have previously made me stew and feel irritable. But I calmly went next door the following day and asked them to keep it down. Previously this sort of encounter would have made my heart race and I would have been prone to getting flustered and upset and probably coming across as aggressive.

Side Effects

First week: nausea, dizziness, insomnia, sudden reduction in sensation ‘down there’ but still normal libido. Overall feeling out of it.
Second week: Better overall, with no nausea or dizziness. Much more fatigue, but sleeping well. Libido has probably reduced somewhat. Some lack of motivation about work and going to the gym. Ironically, anxiety was probably one of my bigger motivators when it came to work, so I will need to try to push myself a bit more in future.
Overall, pretty easy to deal with so far.

I’m feeling optimistic about the whole thing. Hopefully it continues to improve in the next several weeks. Thanks everyone!",0,6,6,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='rx0z9l')>,,/r/lexapro/comments/rx0z9l/my_experience_so_far_2_weeks_on_10_mg/,,,False

I still live in same town as it was only place I could really get but we do not bump into each other which is great. Although today, thankfully it wasn't my ex though, but his mum. I was waiting to get on bus, headphones on and trying hard to focus on what I had to do and not freak out (I'm a terrible traveller at best of time) then someone smacks me on the arm. I kind of freeze cause someone just touched me and I am not okay with someone touching me, but I eventually turned round to her. I have no recollection of what she said, I just know my face was horrified and I have no idea if I managed to get a word out to her. I think she was just saying it had been a long time since she saw me or something along those lines but in what sense did I give vibe I wanted anyone talking to me.

My schedule is eat breakfast watch something for a bit and then take a nap. I’m not currently working so I do have the time, but I want to be more productive. I’m currently being testing for autoimmune diseases and I currently know I have autism (which can cause sleepiness) and fibromyalgia, (which also can) but I feel like I shouldn’t be THIS tired. As the days and months go on I feel like the tiredness just gets worse too. Ive even had days where I’ve slept over 14 hours. I’ve tried fighting the tiredness and I just end up yawning for sometimes hours before I just give up and lay down. I can be in bed all day doing nothing and still need a multiple hour nap. The weird thing is for me is this tiredness last from morning to late afternoon then the rest of the day I’m usually wide awake and have lots of energy. The only way this doesn’t happen is if I’m out doing something extremely engaging, which I can’t do every single day due to life and just pain somedays. I’ve been put on multiple medications for sleep currently I’m on hydroxyzine which does help me sleep at night, but doesn’t get rid of the day tiredness I get. I just want to be productive and get a few things done, but I literally can NOT stay awake.

I am making a post here because I think this is an important issues and so ppl are aware and will unfollow this account. 

@FloofNoodles aka @FriendlyQuest you most definitely have seen. They are most known for the ferret dancing with Pikachu. (idk how to spell it) They recently came under fire for starving their ferret that has insulinoma to death. They were aware of their ferrets sickness and let them, and their other ferrets starve for 2 days. Their reasoning for this is “because they couldn’t get their food” and using their mental health as an excuse. This in itself is very bad, but they proceeded to make a tiktok with the deceased ferret for what? Clout? I can understand not having money in the moment but this person has over 15 million followers! If you take a minute to look at the account you can tell he makes enough to buy their food. They have also received over 1 thousand dollars from others for this issue, and apparently did not not use the money to save this poor ferrets life. They have also been seen giving non species appropriate foods to their ferrets, such as asparagus, strawberries, pizza, and giving bad ferret care advice. If the abuse this person shows to their ferrets isn’t enough, there has been evidence of child grooming. There has been leaked DM’s between this individual and literal children talking  inappropriately. He is harassing ANYONE who talks badly about them, and is trying to play the victim in this situation, I strongly advice unfollowing this account.

But I think the federal discount rate will need to rise to match the 8.3% inflation rate most recently reported in August 2022.

In 1975, when inflation reached a local maximum of 12%, the Fed raised the interest rate to 8% in an attempt to kill inflation, and while inflation did drop temporarily, this interest rate proved to be insufficient to kill it, as inflation hit a new peak of 14% in 1980. It required the Fed raising rates temporarily to a matching 14% to finally send inflation back down to normal rates.

This pattern of central banks needing to raise interest rates above the rate inflation to kill the inflation holds true for other countries, such as Germany and France around the same time periods.

In the period after 1980 until 2007, the federal discount rate was held above or approximately equal to inflation to suppress inflation and keep it around 2%.

The August inflation rate in the US was 8.3%. Shouldn’t the fed need to raise rates to around 8% to kill the new inflation?

I know some sites are arguing the inflation is transitory and doesn’t need central bank action to fix, but inflation has been high since mid-2021, how long does inflation have to persist before it’s not transitory?",15,8,8,0.78,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='xjhb3x')>,,/r/changemyview/comments/xjhb3x/cmv_the_fed_will_need_to_raise_the_federal/,,,False

#Parameters:

- Tows 6x10 cargo trailer that weighs average 1800 to 3500lbs max.
- Ideally fuel efficient, but cheap purchase price can substitute.
- <$10,000 budget.
- <170,000 miles for reliability’s sake.
- No trucks because weather where I live is very rainy, tools would get wet in bed.

#Good examples: 

- 2007 Toyota Sienna. Good fuel mileage, reliable, watertight, can fit 4x8 pieces of drywall, tows 3500lbs (all 2004-2007 have tow package, 2007 has bigger engine). Average 19 mpg. Needs oil cooler pipe replaced to avoid catastrophic engine failure but otherwise very reliable. Current first choice. But good ones are about $9,000 and I’d like to spend less if I can.

- 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee. 4.0l engine is reliable. Gas mileage slightly worse 17mpg but cheaper purchase price, $6-7000. Tows more than sienna. Less cargo space. Fits other criteria.

- 2003 Chevy Blazer. Similar to grand cherokee.

#Bad examples:

- Ford Transit 150 would be super ideal but is way too expensive.

- Ford Transit Connect doesn’t tow enough and expensive

- 2003 Dodge Durango cheap but not very reliable and low mpg.

- F-150 or other truck won’t work because open bed=wet tools=bad

- 2007 Honda odyssey. Generally good but most don’t come with tow package.

- 2006 Toyota highland hybrid. Great mpg. Reasonable price.

First, there have been four recent changes in my life that have caused a lack of quality socialization.  First, I grew up as a reasonably moderate protestant, but have become more atheist over time, to the point where I would now classify myself as a near gnostics atheist. This has removed socialization through church, and a few close relationships. Second, I am completing the last semester of my senior year in a computer science online college. Not only is it the most difficulty I have ever had with school in my life, but you also don't really make very close friends with your classmates in online colleges. Third, I have just recently left home, which removes the automatic socialization through family. I still have some family nearby, but they're somewhat different idealistically (as far as I know). Fourth, I just got a part time job with a landscaping company, which requires that I get up before 6:00 on three days of the week. This requires great discipline on my part, which I have done okay with so far, but it definitely doesn't make it easier. All four changes have wreaked havok on my social life. 

Second, I have been incredible unsure of what I want out of life. 

I will give a selection of what appear to be major goals that people have in life. One seems to be religious fulfillment. Another is to become parents, and do a good job at it. Another is to work very hard and make lots of money. Yet others look to become famous through their work. Some work just to get by and live on the weekends.

Among these goals, I really am not sure which I want to pursue. A loss of religion has removed that avenue. Having a wife and kids seems nice, but a bit difficult to reach, as I haven't even been out on a date. It's not that I'm unattractive, it's just that I've always been quiet, and haven't really thought to actually ask a girl out, since the ones that I was attracted to didn't seem to show any particular interest. Or maybe I was just bad at seeing it. As far as money and fame, I'm kind of split. Will working myself heavily in the name of professional fulfillment make me happy? On the other side, will working a much smaller amount, with less money and fame, but a lot more time will make happy? I don't know.

So, I'm stumbling around trying to keep myself healthy, am unsure of what will make me happy, feel moderately powerless to achieve things that I think of and don't know where to find kindred spirits to relate with on a deeper level.

I don't want to bore you guys with the details, as you probably went through or are going through the same things. Things like depression, irregular sleep/eating schedules, skipping class and avoiding people. Anyways.

I'm back home and I just recently had an interesting conversation with my father about a conversation he had with a very successful (and really cool) doctor/inventor we know. My dad mows his lawn and stuff, and our families have come close be because it has been a good relationship both ways.

They recently had a conversation about life and the future. In that conversation somehow the topic of me dropping out came up. The doctor was concerned for me (personally, I think it's because he went through similar things as a college student). So my dad told him about what I was going through and how I had gone in for counseling. The doctor at this point became rather upset and said, with a strange amount of force compared to how quiet the doctor normally is, ""They didn't give him any damn drugs did they?""

The doctor went on to explain how he thinks that depression is an emotion like any other (although perhaps more extreme than some others) and that it should be an indicator of when I should be making changes in my life. He thought it is not something to be medicated.

My special interests are psychology and religion, so naturally I'm very interested in the many places where the two meet. I've recently stumbled across this idea that a large part of what motivates people to participate in religious group activity and attaches them so strongly to their particular tradition is this seeking after and enjoyment of collective effervescence (a phenomenon where individuals in groups can begin to feel and act as a group rather than individuals). I've read that people seek after this experience instinctively to develop and strengthen social bonds. This has been posited as a possible explanation for group religious experiences of connectedness with a god or gods, the holy spirit, etc. It also is thought to be part of why people in modern times enjoy group activities such as sporting events and concerts, which have shared mechanics and psychological effects with religious group activities.

The kicker is, I hate this feeling! I've experienced collective effervescence and it felt like my brain was hijacked by a stranger. I also don't care for concerts or sporting events, but I always assumed it was because of the overwhelming stimuli. Now I wonder if it also is due to my avoidance of this phenomenon. Also, despite religion being a special interest, I am not religious. I've tried to participate in multiple religions and join multiple religious groups due to my high interest in religion, but none of them ever fit for me. I'm curious if this is an autism thing, but I can't find any data online, anecdotal or otherwise, about autistic or even other neurodivergent opinions/experiences related to collective effervescence.

I heard about OSR and at first was excited to dive in, only to realize what OSR means by old school and what comes to mind when I think old school are totally different.

I grew up on D&D 3.5 and crunchy CRPGs from the 90s and early 2000s. Old school to me conjured memories of character driven, dice roll heavy, sandboxes with a heavy dose of dungeons ala Might and Magic, Morrowind, Fallout, etc.  I know I am talking a lot about video games when referencing table tops, but my D&D groups growing up were heavily influenced by them. Knights of the Old Republic was basically my D&D primer and how I modeled my early campaigns.  


I realized after reading the old school primer and looking through the rules for AD&D and OSE that when it comes to TTRPGs, old school means almost the opposite of what I grew up with. Things are more rules lite with heavy emphasis on role playing rather than dice rolls, and player skill rather than character skill. This may be a contentious thing to say, but OSR games seem more similar to D&D 5e than they are to D&D 3.5.  


What I'm getting at here is what do we call this style of game I grew up with and want to play more of? If I were to eventually design my own TTRPG in this vein, what would I call it if not old school? 2000s crunch? I haven't really heard a term for it.  


I wasn't around in the 70s & 80s when the games OSR is based on were popular and haven't actually played one myself so I may be ignorant in some of what I've said. I am honestly having a hard time understanding all of these different types of play and how to communicate to others in the community the type of game I run so any help here would be appreciated.  


tl;dr What do we call 90s/early 2000s TTRPGs if not old school or OSR? Can crunchy dice roll heavy games be considered OSR?

1860,yes,gurps,2023-01-24 16:19:36,FlamingPhoenix24,Running GURPS for total RPG newbies,"I am wanting to run a light and fun high fantasy one shot for a couple of good friends. One has played D&D once with no other TTRPG experience, and the other has never played a TTRPG, but both are familiar with common fantasy tropes from books and movies. Originally, I was going to run it in D&D 5e, but I've grown tired of that system for various reasons beyond even the recent debacle with WotC and would much prefer to pay GURPS. My friends are open to this, but don't really know the difference. I don't want to overwhelm them with crunch and turn them off from TTRPGs altogether, but the way I run GURPS seems simple and intuitive enough for them. I just can't look at it with clean eyes after playing and running various TTRPGs for over a decade.

I will provide them with simple templates for races and a list of basic careers and skills used in this world. I am not using encumbrance and any other such complex rules I've homebrewed simplified variants of. What do yall think? Is a very simplified GURPS ideal for newbies, or should I just suck it up and run 5e for them?

EDIT

Just for clarity, I did ask my players about having me make pre-generated characters for them based on a concept they wanted to play, but they said they didn't like that idea. Building a character was an exciting part of the game for them that they wanted to do themselves. I was making custom race templates anyway to help flavor my homebrew setting, so I figured it may help them, but use of them would be optional, of course. I don't really want to do class/career templates because the way they are done in the example from the basic set pretty much builds the character for you, but I thought of making class/career talents. It's an idea I'm still thinking over and haven't put pen to paper on, so any suggestions on this would be appreciated as well.",23,39,39,0.97,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='10k9705')>,,/r/gurps/comments/10k9705/running_gurps_for_total_rpg_newbies/,,,False

It is high fantasy set in the mythic period (distant past relative to my previous campaign in 5e) of my custom setting (Thauma). Since it is in GURPS which has a lot of old school flavor I like (I grew up on CRPGs older than me) and it is set in a more classic period in game, I wanted to give it some old school flavor. For instance, I'm making the class/race templates now and I'm giving the dwarves the magic resistance advantage, which also keeps them from casting magic, while elves will have the opposite advantage which makes them stronger casters but also weak to magic (that advantage name escapes me at the moment). I like the idea of having larger advantages with related negative trade offs, but I can't think of more of these at the moment.

Do you all have any suggestions for more old school flavor? It could be the concept above or different ones. It could have to do with races/classes but also other things. My main inspirations are early Elder Scrolls, Might and Magic 2&3, and The Hobbit/LotR for reference. Any suggestions for unique (especially beast) races and monsters would be welcome!

I am hoping to play my first game soon, and I'm thinking about introducing it to my current 5e players once I have a firm grasp on the basic rules (starting with GURPS lite). I am wondering about the dungeon fantasy book. How does it stack up to D&D? I've heard that D&D does fantasy better, but GURPS does it well along with anything else you could throw at it, but does anyone here prefer GURPS for high fantasy? If so, why exactly?

Additionally, is it recommended I get dungeon fantasy, or would it be best to just get the basic set since I also want to run games in many different settings? My main draw for dungeon fantasy is the included race/class templates, so please let me know if the basic set has templates or guidelines for making templates for my players. I feel GURPS will be a much easier sell if I can hand my players a race/class template of their choosing and let them finish from there rather than building their concept from scratch.

EDIT

After reading some replies and giving it some thought, I've decided not to get dungeon fantasy or otherwise try to recreate the D&D experience with GURPS. I enjoy doing lots of prep, making an original setting, creating monsters, etc. So I'll likely opt for the basic set once the time comes to upgrade from GURPS Lite. If anyone happens to know where I can find the basic spellcasting rules online for free, I would be grateful. I would love to have access to at least some spellcasting before getting the basic set if possible.

(I called them “squeezies” as a kid) I realized I’ve been suppressing them allot without consciously realizing how much effort was going into it… I’m able to make them barely noticeable unless there is someone else in the room with tics, but I’m wondering if suppressing them is healthy? Today I stopped suppressing my tics and I’ve felt noticeably less anxious and I haven’t been clinching my jaw and grinding my teeth at all, which I’ve been doing allot lately. That makes me think the teeth grinding and muscle tightness was related to tic suppressing. So I’m thinking although it is less socially acceptable, it seems like a good idea to just let myself tic more. Also could this be a good reason to seek a diagnosis and look into treatment options?

I'm worried i might actually be scaring him because he runs away as if he's the prey and sometimes he will not get out of that mode when playtime is over and keeps pouncing me and ""clicking"" (what i call a short hiss, it sounds like when a human makes the tsk tsk tsk sound).

The same way that premarital and extra-marital sex is forbidden for everyone, so yes even heterosexuals feel the struggle of this.  But for heteros it is temporary.   
But it is forbidden for the LGBT to get married. So God expects the LGBT to suppress themselves for the rest of their lives.. To live a life completely alone while their friends get married.

Why does God decide that a Muslim trans person can feel trans, be born that way but never express their inner sense of self like everyone else? The repercussions of this are often suicide.. which is also Haram... but what else can they do? Pray to a God who forces a sin upon them from birth?

One of my favorites is 90 Day Fiancé and all of its spin-offs, so naturally, when Match Me Abroad came out on TLC, I hit play.

Only a few episodes are out so far of this show, so I can’t say how it ends up or how much worse it may get, but I’m calling it out now. This is harmful and hateful.

I keep my LinkedIn updated - more as a way to keep track of everything for myself, less for other people. 

I am very happy where I work now and have nothing set to give off the sign that I am looking for anything new- but understand that doesn’t deter recruiters. 

I was reached out to by a recruiter (team lead) about a month ago on LinkedIn that had actually typed up a message (I get the copy/paste, not-real-opportunities messages all the time, this one was real) to me. I had never interacted with a recruiter before. 

We exchanged a few messages. They explained vague details about a position they thought I’d be a good fit for, provided a job description, asked me to send my resume if interested, and asked to schedule a phone call to “learn more about me.” 

I scheduled a call with them. We had our call a few days later- spent about 40 minutes discussing the role, my background/education/experience, the salary band, etc. He sent me an email basically for me to agree I wouldn’t go apply to this position without going through him and I agreed. He told me he sent off my application. He didn’t give me a timeline or “what to expect.”

Then nothing- for a week. 

I emailed him to make sure I didn’t miss anything - and he said they would “ping” the company again that day, but that they just hadn’t heard back from them yet. 

Then nothing. 

I ended up deciding that this “opportunity” was not something I was interested in (multiple GlassDoor reviews for the place mentioned everyone crying on a regular basis at work because of how awful management was) and decided to just see if I ever heard back without continuing to initiate. 

Eventually, about 3 weeks after applying, with no follow up phone call, email, timeline, interview, etc., I got an email back from the recruiter saying the company “went in a different direction” and that he’d love to “work with me in the future.”

I had told this recruiter that I had never worked with a recruiter before from the get go. He knew he was not only making a first impression for himself and his own organization, but also for the entire field of recruiting as well. And I have to say, this was quite embarrassing for him and his organization- at least in my opinion. 

Has anyone else experienced really weird, even unsolicited “time wasting” like this? The real qualm I have was the lack of communication, I guess.

It gets made, picked up, and then is on its way for 15 minutes longer then projected, so we reach out and the dasher is uncontactable. We reach out to DoorDash and they say they’ll have to reassign it- it will have to be remade and re-picked up. We were super hungry, but ok. 

It gets made again, picked up, and then on its way. It is delivered! Or so we thought… was supposed to be two bags, was only one. Just one little box of dessert was delivered- we didn’t order dessert. 

At this point- it’s an hour and a half after this journey began. We are so hungry. 

We call DoorDash and ask for our money back, and call the restaurant to ask for our order to be made a THIRD time. We let them know we were on the way to get it ourselves. (It isn’t very safe for me to drive at night so was hoping to avoid this.)

When we get there- this is the best part- the restaurant let’s us know that the first dasher that came watched them pack up our food and kept asking what each component was, then remarking how delicious it looked, and how hungry they were… the said they were suspicious it wouldn’t make it to us that round. 

We then had to pay for our meal at the restaurant and of course wait multiple days to get a refund from DoorDash.

They needed help putting together a spreadsheet to track their profit and loss, but the specifics of this spreadsheet were quite expansive. 

They knew I had the capability to help, as well as the time, so they explained what they needed and said they’d pay me “more than anyone ever has for my time.”

I’ve been paid up to $35 an hour for my time (which they knew), so I thought this would be a sweet gig. 

I spent about 15 hours, enrolled the help of my brother on a few small formulas I couldn’t figure out, knowing I’d have a big check headed my way and would absolutely cut him in on it, and then scheduled a meeting to work through the sheet with the family member. 

We met, I showed them the inner workings, the beautiful visuals, the summary sheets, etc. and when it was time to leave, I was handed a crisp $100. 

I thought it was a joke at first, but it most certainly was not. 

Which worked out to less than $6 an hour if I include my brother’s time.

2. Get all the dishes out of your room. Take them to the kitchen- you don’t have to wash them or load them in the dishwasher yet, just get them to the kitchen and out of the room for now. 

3. Get all the dirty laundry in a hamper and to the laundry room. If it won’t all fit in a hamper, just get it all to the laundry room. You don’t have to start this yet or even sort it yet, just get it out of the room. 

4. Make your bed. If it’s covered in stuff at this point still, move the stuff. Even if it’s to the floor. You want one big clear spot to work from at this point. 

5. If there are any clothes left, clean or still clean enough, get those all to the bed and do one run through to make sure none of them need to be donated. If some do, establish a Donate Pile. Whatever you’re keeping, leave there for now if the floor/closet/drawers are still chaotic. 

6. Now that all trash, dishes, and clothes are either dealt with or in preliminary stages of being dealt with, start at the door and start going through what is left. Work your way in a circle, clockwise or counterclockwise- tackling only what you can see without opening things. Don’t get distracted with drawer or closet contents today. If something needs donated, get it to the Donate Pile. If something has a home, get it to its home. If it doesn’t have a home, make a pile for it for now. 

7. Now that you’ve finished your circle, it’s time to finish putting clothes up. Hang, fold, etc.

8. Evaluate what piles you have. Get the Donate Pile into a bag/bags and put them in your vehicle or by the door. Or call to schedule a pickup. The other piles need systems / homes. If you have the means to go buy shelves/drawers/cubes/etc, please feel free. If not, we gotta do the best we can do. If that means bags or boxes for now, one for each category, that’s what it means. Then visit thrift stores or garage sales and obtain what you need over time to develop organization or systems. 

9. You should now have a clear bed, clear surfaces, and a clear floor. 
Vacuum and dust. 

You will at some point need to go through drawers and closets. This can be done another day. Today, you have a visibly tidy room, which will likely improve your mental health and allow for more “room” in your brain in future days to tackle the rest. 

Tomorrow, you can do the dishes and laundry. 

I hope this is helpful to anyone! This is what worked for me, I developed this over time.

(TW/CW: COVID, emotional distress)

In Summer of 2022, after a work trip where I was masked the whole time and had boosted weeks before, I got COVID for the first time. 

I was the sickest I’ve ever been in all my 24 years. Of all the awful symptoms I had, I was most scared about losing taste and smell. 

A few days in, it went. 

When nothing at all sounded yummy, I was craving chocolate chip cookies and my amazing husband went out and bought some to bake for me. And when I ate one, I couldn’t taste a thing. I cried and cried and realized I couldn’t smell anything either. 

Once I could bare to stand again, I took a shower. Desperate to smell anything, I grabbed my very favorite: a LUSH Comfort Zone Shower Bomb. I didn’t even really *use* it, I just got it wet and stood there taking the absolute deepest breaths in through my nose I could and I just couldn’t smell it at all. It broke my little heart. I stood there the entire time it took for the thing to dissolve just sniffing it and crying- hoping I could even get the faintest whiff of my favorite smell. 

Over time, my smell (and taste) came mostly back- very, very slowly. I have always enjoyed LUSH (from head to toe every single day), but after that experience- where I really did wonder if I would ever be able to smell again- it makes me so very grateful every time I get to use a Comfort Zone Shower Bomb again. Every time I smell it/use one now, it reminds me to appreciate even the small things in life like smelling. 

Just thought I’d share how a simple thing like a shower bomb has had such an impact on my life and encourage us all to take a moment of mindfulness and gratitude next time we use a LUSH product! 🫶🏽",12,60,60,0.83,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='10rerqv')>,,/r/LushCosmetics/comments/10rerqv/covid_smell_and_comfort_zone/,,,False

1970,yes,Advice,2022-12-31 03:19:23,emdelgrosso,How do I handle my invasive neighbor?,"Context: 
My husband (M25) and I (F24) (no kids) moved into our first home in April 2022. (Southern USA)

The couple that lives on one side of us (“our neighbors”) is older and retired, has lived here for 2x longer than I’ve been alive, have 2 grown kids that have each moved to opposite sides of the country that they don’t see often, and they don’t have any commitments/hobbies other than the husband painting as far as I know. All this to say they have a lot of time and probably less social interaction than they need. 

Situation:
Our neighbors started out very kind, albeit with a much more intense level of involvement with us and our goings on than I had ever seen or experienced but know sometimes people have “nosy neighbors.” But I knew they were kind and well intentioned.

A little bit ago, my husband bumped into them out and about and ended up casually mentioning that I had a medical test coming up. This happening has ended up creating the most overwhelming, frustrating, taxing interpersonal situation I have dealt with in my entire adult life. I know that sounds dramatic. Keep reading.

Since that first test, unfortunately for me, the doctors have found more and more concerning things and have assigned me more and more tests. I have had at least one upcoming test at all times for months at this point, always being promised answers if we just do one more scan/test/procedure. Every single time one of these appointments is approaching, I get a text message from my neighbors telling me I’m being prayed for and asking if I need anything. Every single time one of these appointments pass, I get a call asking me how they’ve gone. 

This has been well intentioned of course, but feels invasive and adds to my overwhelm. 
But I’ve navigated it. Until today. 

I texted her today to let her know how today’s test went so that she didn’t blind-side me while I am in public tomorrow (and so that I could control the timeline, knowing she is going to ask me soon regardless). 
She calls. I let it go to voicemail (my throat hurts from my test today, talking makes it worse, and I am fully out of socializing today) and she texts me asking to call her when I can. I let her know I’m in pain and emotional and will call if I feel up to it and appreciate her caring. 

THEN! My doorbell rings. I’ve been recovering all day. I feel awful. I have been crying all day. I don’t want to socialize. It’s 9 p.m. 

I send my husband to go send her away. She insists she “just wants to hug, doesn’t have to talk.” He knows the shit storm he’d be in for if he made me talk to her, so he kindly said he’d pass on hugs and got her to leave, and then…

SHE. CALLS. MY. FATHER. 

Who I do not live with! 
She doesn’t know my dad knows anything about my medical things. 

This is so far beyond and past anything I am okay with. I feel totally violated. I feel frustrated. I should not have to carry this emotional burden of handling this. 

I can’t handle this the way I feel inclined to because I have to live next to them for an indeterminate amount of time. 

What do I do? What do I say? How do I handle this? Please give me any ideas at all. I’m at my wits end. 

I just want a friendly wave when we see each other outside. The occasional request to keep an eye out when either of us are out of town. A normal neighbor relationship.

I'm in a situation where I have no license or car and a bike with no storage my narc doesn't have access to, which means he can and will pop the tires as often as he can, which means I'll either have to keep getting them fixed or continue relying on him for rides unless I can finance a car (which he historically has also sabotaged), which obviously takes funds away from moving out and extends my time here...and so on.

That alone makes it daunting enough to find a ""cover job"", because he'll make it as difficult as possible to even maintain it, but he'll also be able to predict how much money I'll be getting and be especially invasive of/manipulative with my finances and purchases, even if I keep them personal, as I have a right to do.

I barely even trust him not to mess with my things while I'm out of the house, so naturally I'm hoping to move out as quickly as possible. But knowing I have very little way of transporting things, other than a UHaul truck (important note to remember as I'm writing this), and that he plays games with money and likes to stalk me, how do I even begin looking for a place that he won't know about? How do I keep the address secret anyway?

I've had roommate offers from a few contacts before, and I trust them. I'm not especially willing to put them in his path, but maybe I could arrange a safehouse situation, where I have a facade place he knows about and a second, real place he doesn't. Might also be very pricey and take a while to get to, but maybe worth it if it means he's not forcing my reliance on him and his involvement in my life anymore?

If I can even figure out how to safely get to and from my job and how much I can tell him about anyway (preferably *nothing*, but it's a cover job, and I might have to come up with a cover for the cover...)...

How have you who have gotten out handled it? How do you manage to get into a privately-known new place and go no-contact and not let them know at the same time? Worried he might do something like trick the keys out of me so he can copy them, because I do tend to be fairly naive and manipulatable and he has a known habit of going through pockets and stealing/misplacing/copying keys, and I'm fairly sure he'd stop at nothing to get access to wherever I'm living unless I can reasonably prevent it.

1996,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-05-24 17:36:21,The_Teacat,Has anyone's family ever used a meltdown against you and/or lie to others about what actually happened?,"I've never talked about this one but it's happened a few times with mine, who are very conservative people who don't really believe in special treatment for things like this, and believe that if you're not on their side, you have to be Stockholmed until you are. Any sense of self or personal identity is not quite allowed and will be used against you unless it serves them. I'm still recovering from a lot of it and it's impossible to predict how much unwiring I already have to do, but I tend to be their scapegoat since I fight against it as much as I can.

But yes. I know there's nothing ""wrong"" with me, but they like to manipulate certain reactions out of me so they can demonize me even more. Specifically they've done this with meltdowns and my attachment to sentimental objects about as long as I can remember, seemingly just because they can. It's set me back a *lot* and left me with trust issues as well as anxious and depressive issues I don't like acknowledging since I'm concerned that gives them a ""win"", and I don't like admitting they can have that affect on me. (And it gives them more ways to toy with me and overpower me.)

This happened as recently as a few years ago, during an event where I was having a small, personal crisis over a financial issue. I wasn’t very comfortable around my family at the time and was going non-verbal while processing it, but the main culprit kept stalking me around and trying to force an answer out of me. It ended up not well; I ended up screaming at him to leave me alone as I kept having to retreat further and further to try and find privacy since I was so upset and embarrassed, and all he would do was follow me and? Act like there was anything he could do?

I ended up getting cut a few times trying to get away and was in the process of dealing with that as well and he still wouldn't leave me alone and that just pushed me further. And some windows were broken and he lied to the police about what was happening to make him seem more sympathetic, and none of my family understands what was actually happening and how unsafe and in-danger and just plain upset I felt; when all I needed was some privacy to get my center back and process some shitty feelings. They just demonize me for it now and barely even talk to me; all I wanted was to be left alone during an obvious meltdown? A deeply embarrassing, frustrating moment that their forced involvement kept exacerbating?

I've been dissociating a lot since then, because it's hard to feel safe showing any emotion or vulnerability around them knowing what they might do. I have a very hard time feeling confident in myself, telling stories about things that have happened, and taking responsibility for things due to everything that's happened to me in situations like this. Am I the problem here? These are the people who used to hit me just for being upset with me, punish me for being upset about things, and scold me for basic emotions without understanding why I was so frustrated, and never really helped me in a way that didn't serve them too, so obviously it's difficult for me to feel comfortable showing these things around them, and it's easier to shut down, but it's obvious they can still exacerbate meltdowns when they need to use them against me.

Has anyone else's family done this or been like this? How do you feel safe when they know they can use basic aspects of your brain's wiring like this and when you know they're against you anyway? I've been trying to leave for a long time and they just keep finding ways to remove that ability from me and attempts to infantilize me to keep me further held back and control me/take advantage of me even further. It's not so fun and feels super not nice actually speaking, you know?

1997,yes,raisedbynarcissists,2023-05-23 23:28:00,The_Teacat,It makes me sad how troubled and stigmatized or outcast the children of toxic or narcissistic parents seem to tend to be.,"That's something I know I'll have to deal with in the next few years, assuming we make it that far. Knowing I was right. Knowing I'll be hated for the effect their actions had on me, and for the way I had to be in situations that weren't my fault. For the choices I had to make to survive the choices they made, and knowing how he'll make up all these wonderful things from my childhood (his version of it, anyway) while putting down the actual living version of me just because I wouldn't fall in line (and sacrifice the person I made myself into without him in order to work with and appease him, even though I don't and shouldn't have to do that).

He's already getting to a point where he's idealizing and memorializing a childhood version of me that never existed and a version of my childhood that never existed. Showing appreciation for things that never happened or that he barely even noticed at the time, if at all. But now that it's convenient to make these stories up and pretend he had a different version of me to treasure than the one standing up for myself and setting boundaries he doesn't appreciate, he's started doing it more and more, and it's hilarious how different our stories of that version of me are.

And there's no way I can really say different. ""That's not what happened,"" because I know it's not, but it just sounds and feels like he's talking about a dead child instead of working with the one that's still in front of him - the one he always cast off and humiliated and ignored until it was too late and we both realized the damage was already done, and he realized he had lost my trust and respect with everything I've figured out he's done to me.

So now he's clinging to a fake history and telling stories about the version of me that's still alive behind my back with all of his collaborators and the people who helped, and he gets to act like the perfect, loving father I always tried to believe he was, and I know that's just the way it goes. And I've accepted that. But it's sad. I know how many kids these sorts of things happen to.

I hope everyone here gets a chance to move on and realize how much value they have, not because they were given it but because they're here and they give themselves value for being here.",3,23,23,0.97,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13q4glp')>,,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/13q4glp/it_makes_me_sad_how_troubled_and_stigmatized_or/,,,False

1999,yes,raisedbynarcissists,2023-05-20 10:57:42,The_Teacat,"Not sure where to put this. Family member stole my property, makes excuses, plays games.","I'm in a shit situation and not sure what to do. A family member claims to have taken a box of important books of mine to the thrift store, but for various reasons, I don't believe they did. Now, I know that they *did* take the books; the box is gone, so in any of the four possible scenarios I can think of, it is definitely deleted and out of my hands.

They've been cleaning the area where I temporarily was forced to store them and I, in my attempt to assume I didn't have to specifically list an entire itemized inventory for them to know not to touch my things, assumed it wouldn't be included. In the past, this person has had a habit of taking other people's things to the garbage dump, including video tapes and useful electronics that were not their property, and only recently started ""taking things to the thrift store"", but I can only confirm that's their destination if I'm involved, and I recently have not been able to be.

They claim they ""didn't know"" the books were mine. As the majority of what they've been clearing out was their partner's property, and for various unfortunate reasons, a lot of mine is mixed in, *and* because I haven't been able to help in the way I traditionally have and needed to be (specifically for things like this), they had an easy excuse: ""There are lots of books around here that were just going unread, so I thought...!""

...1) there are not that many books. All of the books that there are were either hers or mine, and it was obvious which ones are mine. 2) This person *knows* I value books and do actively read them, but they personally are against such intellectualism and have been trying to offload things from their life as a means of self-preservation and power tripping, so of *course* you either need to be achingly overly specific (and have them do a genie routine and find loopholes in every single thing you say), exhaustingly involved (and open yourself up to their constant self-obsessions), or accept that your property is never, ever safe and they'll always have an excuse for it.

So, box of books is gone. The claim is they're at the thrift store, which I don't specifically believe due to past behavior and social track record of the involved individual. Upon questioning, they claim they're maybe willing to go there with me and see about ""getting them back""; I am unable currently to fix problems like this on my own, making it more infuriating that it might have happened at all. (They like to play games with my neurodivergences and attachments specifically to get meltdown-style rises out of me, and set my progress in life back constantly. This is not the first time something like this has happened, and it almost always follows a period of time in which they're *especially* narcissistically manipulative to drive me to the point of total isolation and grey rocking, so they can claim that I bothered them and follow it up with other events similar to this that are seemingly specifically designed to infuriate me for being uncontrollable and setting boundaries with them. Fun!)

However, again, I don't believe they took them anywhere but the garbage dump, but I am concerned that the whole thing is a game to humiliate me, waste my time, and get rid of my books that I need while laughing to themselves in their power trip. (It was known that they were my books; however, they weren't *specifically* marked and this person is very good at getting away with doing very terrible things with social manipulation, ""I don't remember""s, and ""I assumed"" this and thats. So, inherently frustrating as a person to deal with.)

So, I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to waste a Saturday and give them attention they don't deserve, knowing they very likely are not at the thrift store. I'd like to let the books go, knowing I might never see them again excepting if I try and remember what they were and hope to repurchase them. But some of them were valuable research copies I had filled with notes and study work, and all of them were necessary for my work; without them, I can't really get any of my writing or research done, so I'm almost completely out of ways to continue making money doing what I'm good at. (This is known to this person too, because I keep going on about how important these things are and how much I need this work, revealing *exactly* the things they can use to toy with me. 🙃)

It's infuriating that they would do something like this; not surprising. But the latest in a long line of similar behavior patterns against me. I can maybe spend this weekend with them trying to fix it. But there doesn't seem to be an easy win here. I was planning on spending this weekend working since this is my first one actually free in quite sometime, and I'm fairly sure this person *knew* that so of course they'd set me back like this.

But. Advice is definitely desired. What can I do? Is there anything I should be doing here? I've been high tension for days because of the sudden loss and change of plans and environment situations. Obviously it's not very pleasant.

Sorry if this isn't the right subreddit to post this on.

2000,yes,raisedbynarcissists,2023-05-18 15:55:44,The_Teacat,Bit of a vent...grey rocking is the hardest thing I know I have to do. There always seems to be so few real ways to adjust when no contact is no option.,"(ETA: Flaired as rant/vent because, although I feel like support might help, I'm not sure what would be most helpful. As you'll see, I do know most of what I *should* be able to do realistically-speaking, so I'm not sure about the advice thing, but I'm not opposed to advice at all. I also know that just talking about what has happened and knowing people have heard it helps validate the experiences, but that's no one's job except maybe a therapist...and the therapist racket in my area is, uhm, very much less than stellar and that can and has been used against me in the past, so...? Ahhhhhh? TFW your experiences lead you to overexplain and overthink everything.)

When they know every detail about you, when they're expert manipulators, when their plan for you goes back years and you're just beginning to realize how stupid you were, when you can barely move without them knowing. When you have to shut down and sacrifice when you've already lost everything, and when they use even that against you.

Grey rocking is the hardest thing you can do. Watching it all fall apart...hoping the next thing you do might help you get out. Knowing what it's going to cost you to help you escape. Realizing keeping yourself safe and hidden just isn't enough, all while exhaustingly keeping yourself shut down and as apathetic as possible to give them as little as possible. While everyone you cared about fades away because they can't help you and you can't even talk about what's happening, let alone save yourself. (They made sure of that years before I realized what they were even doing. I was innocent and stupid then, and it took me too long to catch on, longer still to figure out where their plans were going, and longer after that to figure possible ways out. In a game I never wanted to play in the first place.)

I read the guide on narcissistic traits (as if I don't know from experience already...) and good lord, it's terrifying how many specific memories seem directly referenced by the article. Although for me, it's a male parent...something that makes it even more especially humiliating to talk about, since - as in the article - he's very competitive and likes to screw with my grooming and self-worth habits, and what grown male adult wants to admit their own male parent is doing things like that to them? (My mother, while she was alive, was their other toy like this and she never even really realized it. I tried to help, but they separated us and she ended up not believing me at all. Probably should've ensured better security for myself and for her before I did that. But that was in the earliest stages of waking up to what they're doing, and when they began to realize I was realizing now too.)

I used to see a bright future, and I knew I was almost there. I can still see it somedays. I've always had parts of me *know* these things were happening even as I watched every opportunity I gave myself be stolen away and ripped apart, but I've always struggled with being slow and naive and it's taken me far too long to put the pieces together. Usually I don't realize what the goal was of a particular step in the plan was until hours or days afterward; and it's deeply unsettling to know there *is* one and more exhausting to have to spend hours figuring out what it is just so you can suggest ways to yourself to counteract and escape it. Or at the very least, hopefully survive emotionally long enough to see another day.

There was even a time they teamed up and were so much and so intimidating that I was completely convinced and *terrified* that they were going to kill me. I still think they might. And maybe that’s part of it. But I had no way to show an intention so I couldn't call for authority's help like my friends kept suggesting I do, and obviously I couldn't reach out to my friends for backup, as that's unfair, harmful, and not something anyone should really have to do.

But regardless, I lost what was left of my friend group that weekend. Leaving me with only everyone online I was smart enough not to talk to about it, and very little support overall. (Largely because I'm just not situationally-stable and secure enough to be able to continue maintaining friendships in a safe way, so I can't commit to anything, I can't provide anything, I can't make a single plan without knowing he'll ruin it as soon as he learns - or already have found a way to schedule my future just a few days ahead. One of the first and most regularly recurring ways I ended up losing *most* of the things I was once so on top of. - , so everything falls by the wayside.)

So much of the things on this list have happened to me...he even ruined me financially in a deeply insidious way, and in some other ways I've been trying to investigate just so I can figure out exactly what and how he did it, and that was one of the earliest ways I really caught on to what he was doing with me. He only recently decided to undo some of that (without telling me anything, of course, although by now it's too late, and I have very few ways of carrying on *without* relying on his involvement and continued knowledge of those things). He's still manipulating my financials and it's all I can do to figure out ways around it. I am 30 years old and terrified to even try and get another job for fear of what he might do with the money coming in, or how my personal documents might disappear behind my back again, or so on and so on...

Anyway. I don't wanna say I don't know what to do...I know what I *need* to do (maintain work, keep financials decent, figure out a potential safe roommate situation, learn to let things to and unfortunately have to sacrifice to be safe). And it's all the hardest things I can imagine. I know I'm holding myself back in some ways; certainly the apathy, long-term emotional shutdowns for safety's sake, and lingering attachments to things I thought would be safe and treasured but can only be used against me (and have, very recently and constantly) are huge detriments. But I can barely even leave my room without keeping a thousand different things in mind to keep myself ready to defend against his games and the overall plan.

I'm hoping I'll be able to be out soon. But it keeps getting worse. So we'll see. Hoping to hear back about jobs, and worried about what happens after that. (As more of my art supplies vanish, and recently, a box of books I needed and was actively using for research and my once-hopeful professional career...they always go after your passions. And always the ones that could help you/uplift you the most. I want to scream.)

None of it is where I wanted to be right now. I guess that's inevitable...thanks all for listening even a little bit. Talking and writing about it somewhere helps to some degree.

I can usually interpret my dreams fairly well and draw easy patterns to recent events, memories on my mind, subconscious things I might be processing. But this one came out of nowhere. Maybe just random bits of imagination firing away in my sleep? Can anyone attest?

2018,yes,Dreams,2022-08-21 03:34:09,The_Teacat,Anxiety after strange disneyland dream.,"I dream a lot. Vivid visualisations and lucid dreaming come easy for me, so my dreams tend to be nearly-complete (if slightly strange) storylines in my head, usually like small movies or layered dreams, and while they're all mostly different and rarely even feature me at all, there are some recurring elements that have formed into their own little dreamscapes or nightly anthologies.

(Yes, I have a lot of dreaming practice. It's a very important skill for me to cultivate.)

One major element is Disneyland. I dream about different parts of an alternate version of it, different sections each time but always the same alternate version of it.

I've never dreamed about entering the park, though. Now I have, and it...did not go well.

The entryway ticket booths here are now in an enclosed room, like a security checkpoint at a small airport, and you have to run your bags through an x-ray scanner while they check your ticket like one too.

But my ticket wasn't working for some reason. My bag got stuck until they could verify the ticket, and I couldn't leave back out the front until they were sure who I was either, so I told my family to go on ahead while he fuddled with my ticket and I'd catch up when it was all settled.

Only, I eventually fell asleep in the ticket line. When I woke up, it was just past 10 at night and the park was still open but closing very soon.

He tried my ticket a few more times, my bag is still stuck, and finally, they call security, a team of two women and one man, who show up and take me to what looks like a dank kennel beside the bank on main street. I think things are going well, but the man leaves and when he comes back, he's holding a taser and they say I'm going to get tased so can I please stand still, and put a ""hot pad"" on my head, which looks like a defibrillator pad mixed with a blood pressure testing wrap. They tell me it'll hurt worse with it but it's harmless, and he tases me and I get knocked to the ground, my jaw clenched, and not least of all, I can feel this horrible burning pressure at the top of my head where I guess the pad must've absorbed the tase or something.

Anyway, I've never been tased but my dreams are as vivid as they come, so I can feel every inch of it and it hurts like hell. He tases me again before finally letting me go, and I'm able to walk back to the front gate. Management's waiting there for me with the ticket taker guy, and they're all still figuring out what to do with me, since it's just past 11 now and I can't leave until they let me in, and I'm just trying to figure out why the hell they had to tase me to figure that much out.

Manager and the ticket guy joke that I'm ""like that Tom Hanks movie where he gets trapped in an airport"". The Terminal; but I'm not laughing. It's late. My family's gone. And I'm stuck at the front gates of Disneyland for something I didn't do and no one can figure it out.

The company does have a policy that encourages employee to stay home when they’re sick, but it doesn’t seem to be enforced – or at least not for this person, who seems to buck at authority and just comes to work anyway. My family member has not been with the company long enough to earn sick leave or paid time off. So whenever they get sick and have to stay home, that’s unpaid time. Additionally, their spouse has an autoimmune disorder, which places them at risk for more significant symptoms, particularly when it pertains to upper respiratory viruses. Since starting at this company, my family member has ben sick 6x as a result of this person coming into work sick. They missed an entire week of work (and wages) in early September, due to this co-worker coming to work with COVID and passing it around the office.

And, again, had to take unpaid time off to recover.

Staying away from this person is not an option.

2040,yes,legaladvice,2022-06-06 14:08:57,vingtsun_guy,Neighbor wants to be build fence on shared property line,"Foundation - I live in Southwestern Montana. I own a property that neighbors a property that was recently sold. My property doesn't have its own drive approach, as the properties were previously owned by a son and father. We were allowed to use the drive approach - on public right-of-way - in front of the neighboring parcel by the previous, and the ""country road"" that follows is located on both properties up until we reach the area where we park our vehicle - meaning it started on the neighboring property, then crossed over into a property, before a sharp turn placed it entirely on the other property the rest of the way. We would drive approx. 65 ft on the neighboring property before being on our own property for the remainder of the way. New owners were not happy with that. They decided to build a fence to block our use of those 65 ft. While it was shocking that they would take such an action, particularly without giving us the heads up, we were largely ok with it. Our plan was always to build our own entryway, and to install those old fashioned arches at the front - we just figured we had other priorities right now, with regards to our home and our pasture, and we figured we'd get to it eventually. For now, we can continue to use the drive approach that is on the public right-of-way, and then make a turn and get ""off road"" to get into our own property. The drive approach crosses over a ditch, and this is the only way to access our property from the main road, right now. This is definitely a petty move by the neighbor, as more than half of the fence cuts at parts more than halfway into the road itself. 

Problem - the neighbors put the posts for their fence directly on the shared property line. In Montana, that makes us possibly responsible for half the cost of the fence and definitely responsible for the upkeep of the fence. Drama ensued when we contacted them and advised them we had not agreed to the fence being build on the property line. I even apologized for not reaching out sooner, as I'd not noticed it until I saw the posts, but told them we did not want to be responsible for a fence we didn't choose to build, and asked that they move the fence into their own property. And have now threatened to modify the drive approach on the public right-of-way to make it so that we can't use it to access our property. 

Questions - 

1 - Is it legal for a property owner, in Montana, build a fence on a shared property line without the agreement of the neighbor property owner - who, by statute would be also responsible for the fence?

2043,yes,AutisticAdults,2022-04-22 16:35:32,vingtsun_guy,Out of bounds and clueless,"I'll be the first to admit I have a weird sense of humor. Things that people typically find funny are confusing to me. Things that amuse me, I've come to know, are not necessarily funny to other people. I make stupid jokes all the time, and the frequency of my sarcasm or social commentary/observations increases when I'm off my game - i.e. if I'm tired, if I'm sick, if I'm having a bad day, etc.

The problem becomes when I make jokes or comments that she doesn't find funny, but she won't tell me. It's like she expects me to read between the lines and know that she doesn't find something funny. I'm not very good at reading between the lines or picking up on nuances, as I'm sure y'all can imagine. So things go on until she gets upset, and no she didn't tell me outright that she didn't think it was funny, but she was communicating with me that it was and I should know. 

I am perfectly ok with not being like that.  I do have the ability to withdraw if I'm processing through something, but that tends to bother her too. So I'm caught between being my natural self, with the expectation that I should be able to pick up on something that's being indirectly communicated - which is so foreign to how my brain works, and perhaps impossible altogether, or refraining from that behavior - in which case, she still gets upset. 

How does one communicate through this? Is there a middle ground I'm missing - something that doesn't require me to employ skills that I don't have, but doesn't put the burden of solving this problem on someone else?",1,3,3,0.81,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='u9it4x')>,,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/u9it4x/out_of_bounds_and_clueless/,,,False
2044,yes,BPDFamily,2022-04-17 20:21:50,vingtsun_guy,"boundaries, forgiveness, working through grief","My daughter, through a step-parent adoption, has been evaluated by a neuropsychologist and found to show precursors of BPD. Our relationship is strained at best. She's 15 and has been in a RTF since October of 2021. We are in the process of getting admitted into a boarding school for her junior and senior years. My wife, her biological mother and also her primary ""victim"" of bullying, threatening, and intimidation, does not want her to return home to live. There is a lot of hurt within the family unit from our daughter's behaviors, constant lying and manipulating, playing crazy making games and creating general chaos, lack of accountability and her insistence that everybody else is responsible for the consequences to her own actions/choices.

Back story: approx. One year before I met my wife, I lost my son, my only child, in an accident. He was a few months shy of 19 when he died. I raised my son largely by myself, as his mother died from cancer when he was 4 years-old.

Last year, on my birthday, my daughter faked a suicide attempt over the loss of her cell phone - she'd violated safety rules about cell phone use for the 100th time. My wife describes the scene that she found our daughter in as ""staged"". Suicide attempt ""tools"" to one side, child lyjng over the blanket, a scarf she crocheted for me as a birthday present placed over the pullow to the other side. And I say faked because the story that she tells about what happened and what she supposedly did to herself are not backed by the physical evidence we found upon taking her to the hospital. Since then, it became a pattern of, whenever she was caught doing something she was supposed to do, she was suicidal. This also slowly evolved into comparing herself to my son, saying things like she knew I wanted her to have died instead of him - she never met him, has never been compared to him. And also implying that if she didn't get her way, she would cut her mother and I out of her life once she turns 18.

Yesterday was my birthday again. She called my wife, from the RTF placement, and asked if it was OK to call me. Then she called me - I didn't answer - and left me an awkward voicemail, wishing me a happy birthday, and asking me twice to call her back ""if I wanted to"". I didn't. 

I feel disconnected from her. Because of her actions over the past couple of years. All the lies, all the games. The multiple CPS complaints due to false allegations of abuse against both her mother and I. But most of all, because of the many times that she tried to use the pain I feel for the loss of my son as currency for her to get her way. 

There's a part of me that wants to say, ""you're the adult, act like it"". But my better judgment screams that, given enough range, she will continue to hurt her mother and I, because she can. Because she blames us for not allowing her to do whatever she wants, whenever she wants it. Because she feels that consequences for her own actions are things being done to her unjustly.",13,17,17,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='u5vcfg')>,,/r/BPDFamily/comments/u5vcfg/boundaries_forgiveness_working_through_grief/,,,False

My daughter faked/lied about a suicide attempt. The medical doctor at the ER confirmed that she did not have the physical injuries that would have resulted from what she claims to have done. The psychiatrist who admitted her to the psychiatric facility also told us that her story didn't add up, and she changed her story multiple times. Even my daughter, while she has not admitted that she lied, has admitted that she did ""it"" because she thought it would convince her mother and me to not follow through with consequences for her choices/behavior - she is losing her smartphone, after violating the rules for having a smartphone multiple times. My daughter has a history of faking mental health symptoms, but nothing like this.

She has been in the psychiatric hospital since April 16. All the while still claiming to be actively suicidal - that is, until it became clear to her that she would still not have her phone when she came home. Now she's ready to come home. She will be discharged on April 27.

My daughter will have a plethora of services put in place for her once she is discharged, including a neuro-psychological evaluation to determine if she has a developing personality disorder. My wife and I have a lot of thoughts and feelings about the whole incident. Our biggest struggle right now is that we have been continuously discouraged from telling our child that we know she did not actually try to kill herself. We are struggling to find our footing on how to even begin to heal if we can't be truthful with each other.

I reckon I'm looking for some insight I to how to navigate my daughter's return home, following a fake suicide attempt that aimed at manipulating her way out of a consequence for her own choices.

— Is there anything you wont tell them?
— They dont diagnose, they’re not clinical psychologists. But unofficially they have acknowledged my symptoms 
—  want to know the structure of therapy, roadmap if you will. Is this the right way?

I was hoping some of you who have experience with therapy could give some tips on how to set goals and ideas on how to (&how not to) interact with the therapist. Hoping to do this right.

I am from a small town in India and found a doctor in New Delhi for online consultation for diagnosis.   


although doctor said she only does face to face diagnosis and with a family member, I asked her if the effort was worth it. She said following:

&#x200B;

“I haven't seen a case of child or adult autism/asperger's who have sought diagnosis or treatment on their own. They are usually bought by family members due to associated issues like anxiety, OCD, depression etc. Which may mean that a person with a diagnosis of ASD would not have the emotional understanding of their issues (that is, ASD symptoms).”

”I am not saying you do not have ASD.. but the fact that you are thinking you may have it kind of goes against my hypothesis.”

“About support groups,  there are no support groups for adult asperger or ADHD in India. There aren't any professionals specifically trained to deal with cases of adult ASD. Adult ADHD can still be taken care of.”

“What I would suggest is that rather than going for a specific diagnosis.. keep in mind the current issues you are having as well as your concerns.. seek a clinical psychologist who can take a detailed case history and then decide which direction of assessment and intervention should be planned”

although Im not very comfortable posting her words here, I wanted to know what to make of it.  going to get a psychoanalysis done scares me & seems long shot.

My husband and I have had a rollercoaster of a relationship as far as highs and lows, and not being able to properly communicate our issues and be in sync. I’ve recently started questioning if my husband is on the spectrum after a friend of mine was recently just diagnosed and had a revelation that a lot of his life struggles could have been better managed better had he known sooner, and it made me realize that my husband has a lot of those similar qualities. Once I realized this might be a possibility it was like this lightbulb when off and I started wondering if a lot of things I was getting frustrated with were because of the possibility of his ASD, and it made me see him in a new light (and even has made me pause before getting frustrated with him after realizing maybe he can’t help certain things). 

Here is my list of things that have made me question this:
- He doesn’t make a lot of eye contact with me, and when I’m telling him a story I often find myself saying “Are you listening?” And he snaps back “Yes I’m listening!?” 
- He gets a lot of anxiety when going to a new place, and always asks where we will be parking when we get there and is anxious the entire drive 
- He doesn’t like when plans are “sprung” on him, and it makes him mad and have caused several fights between us if my family invites us over “last minute” (aka a couple days away). 
- He always questions everyone’s motives and constantly thinks everyone is against him or is talking behind his back, even when they are not.  
- He goes through phases and obsessions over things, and it completely takes over his mind. For example: for months he played the same video game for hours and hours every day, then for months and months he obsessively watched YouTube videos about skateboards every night, then for a year or two he obsessively got involved in the QAnon cult movement online (it almost ended our marriage because it was affecting me and our kids). 
- He gives “squeeze hugs” where instead of gently hugging me sometimes he’ll squeeze me so hard that it hurts and I have to tell him to stop 
- He uses the same phrases in conversation constantly. 
- He doesn’t like anybody (even me when I’m just cleaning our house) touching his things, and gets very angry if he can’t find something of his. 
- (This one has caused a TON of emotional conversations and arguments between us) He doesn’t seem to understand how to comfort me when I’m upset, or even show any care when I’m sitting in front of him crying about something. He stares blankly at me or just says “It’s ok.” in a monotone manner. And when I say “I feel like you don’t even care about me or care when I’m upset” he always acts really confused and says “You know that’s not true? I love you”. It’s just so confusing. 

If you made it this far I really appreciate it. I guess I just find myself constantly questioning myself and constantly questioning if these qualities of his are part of a high functioning ASD.

So everyone knows about what a gross dickhead Ronnie was in Miami (hooking up with girls and then going back home to Sam, calling her a c***, etc.). They go home. I assume just a couple short months later is when they go back to the Jersey Shore house that next summer. 

In the first episode of season 3 when they’re all moving back into the house, it shows Ronnie and Sammi getting ready and driving there together and picking their room and what not. They seem really “in sync” and really into each other, acting like a “team”, very affectionate, etc. They also were very against Jenni and Snooki and seemed to act like everybody in the house was on their side. 

By the second episode of season 3 there’s a BIG shift of energy between Sammi and Ronnie, which results in them bickering/fighting the whole end of the episode on the boardwalk and then again back home. Sammi starts crying and saying how hurt she was by Ronnie’s behavior in Miami (while they showed flashbacks from the previous season). She also kept making comments implying she feels “alone” and that nobody is there for her in the house. 

It always baffled me why it seemed like all of a sudden Sammi’s mood shifted and suddenly she felt alone from the rest of the house and was clearly emotional/hurt by Ronnie. She even apologizes to Snooki and Jenni very shortly after this. 

It only JUST hit me now, that I think they showed the house the airing of the first episode or two of their Miami season. 🤯 I read somewhere on this thread that they usually never let them do that but they did that season because they knew it would cause more drama (and right they were).

- In the OG series when she made out with Pauly and then the next morning acted like she didn’t remember that ever happening and was asking Pauly and Vinny questions like she didn’t remember.

https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/s9jyj6/just_feeling_lost_and_would_love_support_dont/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

For months I’ve been avoiding talking to him about all of this because it always ends in a fight and/or me crying myself to sleep. For months he’s been sending all of his friends and family members articles and videos and memes about how Putin is helping trump to destroy toxic labs over in Ukraine and that he’s “not going to pray for Ukraine”. Along with countless antivax pages. 

I tried talking to him again about it today and I asked him if (god forbid) something we’re to happen to our kids one day (like a medical problem) would be blame it on me and say that I poisoned them because I got them all their regular childhood vaccinations. His response was “I already think there’s something wrong with *my oldest son who is 4”. He sometimes shakes his hand a funny way or doesn’t respond the first couple times you call his name. What if something is wrong with him?? What if it was from a vaccine??” After that moment I just broke down and cried and said I can’t do this anymore. 

I no longer can live my life in fear and anxiety, which is how he lives his. I can’t listen to the theories anymore. I can’t listen to his “facts” or listen to him call me a sheep and that I’m harming our children. I’m broken hearted because he used to be my best friend and I love him so much, but he’s like a stranger to me now.

When I was crying and telling him I can’t do this anymore, and asking him if he had anything else he wanted to say about our relationship, he goes “Don’t be so fucking dramatic.” ….I’m just at a loss of the person he turned into.

Edit: Wow thank you all so much for all of your thoughtful responses and your support. I didn’t expect this much of a reaction, and this group never ceases to amaze me with how supportive everyone is. This is going to be a hard road, but I’m ready to see where it takes me.

2160,yes,Petloss,2022-03-05 12:06:35,Trashtvslit,Delayed grief/extreme guilt. Feeling heartbroken.,"My 15 year old Yorkshire terrier passed away almost a year ago, last April. I got him when I was 13 years old (I’m almost 30 now). 

I still remember the day I got him: I had been visiting him for weeks (he was too young to bring home at first) and then I brought him home on my 13th birthday in a thunderstorm, holding him tight so he wasn’t scared. That was the start of 15 beautiful years of having him as the center of our whole family and we all loved him so much.

He was so kind spirited, energetic, hilarious, doofy, and adorable. He would run all over our yard chasing leaves or his tennis balls. He spent many hours outside with me while I practiced pitching for softball throughout middle school and high school. He was there for me throughout everything: divorced parents, friendships, toxic relationships, family parties, going to college and back, breakups, my engagement, pregnancies, new babies, etc. Our whole family adored him and every time someone came over they showered him with pats and love. 

In his older years, he (not surprisingly) started getting shakier, slower, sometimes snappy, barked a lot more. Sometimes I remember getting frustrated if he was taking forever to go to the bathroom and my baby was crying in the house and I’d shout for him to hurry up. The older he got the more accidents he had on the floor (it got to the point in later years where it was multiple times a day). Between having a baby and also being pregnant (and very sick) in that time period, I would often times get mad at him if I stepped in pee or poop in the house and yell at him about how I had just taken him outside or something. I would always later regret it and go cuddle with him on the couch and tell him how much I loved him and appreciated him, but I still would feel awful. 

At one point my mother offered to take him to her attached apartment (we live in a multi-family house) because my mom also had helped raise him, she lived alone, and we were also a little afraid of him getting snappy with the baby. She treated him so kindly and made a whole pee pad area for him and gave him some daily melatonin pills to calm down his anxiety (he would get shaky and pace around the room all the time and had a hard time settling down). I was a stay at home mom with my two kids and my mother worked full time, so she’d often remind me to go take him outside a few times a day. Of course I did this frequently, but there were a few days when I was so caught up with the kids that I forgot, and I would feel so guilty when I realized I forgot and the poor thing had to just pee on his pads. And even when I did go over I always had to rush because I couldn’t leave my kids alone for too long. (Which I always felt guilty about too). Whenever I had the time I would occasionally go to her apartment at night after the kids were in bed and sit with him and tell him how much I love him and try to give him some attention and love (and of course my mom did every night as well). 

2020/2021 was rough (as it was for everyone I’m sure). During my third pregnancy, my uncle (who was like a father to me) unexpectedly died in his sleep, and it shook my whole world. Then a few weeks later I had my baby. For months I had severe postpartum anxiety/depression, while also dealing with the pandemic madness and constantly fighting with my husband (who was a Covid-non believer) it was just a horrible year and a half full of anxiety and uncertainty. 

My dog was getting really old, we think he had dementia and loss of hearing/vision as well. He also had a heart condition that was slowing him down. It broke my heart every time I saw him. One day he was outside on our gated in porch. We would frequently let him walk around out there (once spring hit) to get some fresh air and sun. Unbeknownst to us, one section of the gate on the porch near the stairs wasn’t locked in properly. He somehow must have bumped into that gate or been leaning against it because it broke and he fell down the stairs 😢 I ran out holding him and instantly recognized his back legs weren’t moving 😞 My husband and I rushed him over to our local vet, where she informed us that although he wasn’t in any pain, his back legs were paralyzed, and that he would probably pass soon. We decided to put him down after her suggestion, and he peacefully passed after a strong sedative. I had been holding his paw and crying and telling him how much I loved him and all that he had done for me my whole life, but when the vet told me she was about to give him the dose that would make him pass on, I couldn’t handle the idea of watching him die, so I said goodbye to him and had to let my husband be with him for that (my husband loved him dearly as well) and I walked in the other room. I regret that with all of my heart now. I feel like I should have been there for him in his final moments (even though my husband was). I bawled my eyes out for a day or two and then, oddly enough, I felt almost numb about it and my brain kept forcing myself not to think about him passing. 

It’s taken until literally just a month ago for me to get through my worst year yet of crushing anxiety, panic attacks, and depression (due to many life factors these past couple years). I’ve recently felt a “fog” clear and I’ve been feeling like I’m back to my normal self again and haven’t been getting any panic attacks. And while that’s wonderful, I’ve recently started noticing that I’m being hit with WAVES of emotion/grief/guilt about my dear old dog. I can’t stop crying every time I think about him. I keep having these flashbacks to when he was a puppy, all the fun things we did over the years, then all the times when life got in the way of my connection with him in his older years, and then when he passed away. I have so much guilt, it’s almost like instead of remembering the millions of great times we had with him, my brain is just creating this montage video of any little time that I wasn’t kind to him. Every time I even see a dog or a dog video pops up on my phone, I start crying and think of him. 

I guess I just wanted a place to share my story and look for some peace or comfort if anybody else has had similar emotions. I know my dear pup is resting in the sweetest of peace with all the tennis balls he could dream of, I just hope that he can forgive me for some of the things I mentioned and that he knows how much I love him. 💔🙏🏻",8,21,21,0.93,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='t784ib')>,,/r/Petloss/comments/t784ib/delayed_griefextreme_guilt_feeling_heartbroken/,,,False

2162,yes,Divorce,2022-01-29 20:48:57,Trashtvslit,Considering divorcing my conspiracy theorist husband. Constantly feeling torn and question myself.,"Just feeling lost and would love support. Don’t know what to do about my husband. Feeling so torn.

I’m 28 and my husband is 39. We’ve been together 7 years and have 2 boys together (2 and 4). He is a very laid back, funny, loving person, and he is a great dad who loves his sons dearly. I love my husband very much, but the past 2-3 years have been hell at times, and I don’t know what to do. 

He has always been prone to slight anxiety, seasonal (winter) depression, and would sometimes go through “phases” of obsessing over things. For example, for a while he was obsessed with water filtration systems because he watched too many YouTube videos telling him that our tap water could cause cancer. Then he was obsessed with UV lights that he bought online because he claimed they help with all sorts of problems (muscle problems, vitamins, preventing cancer, etc.). I would gently point out to him that he has a habit of going through phases like this, and sometimes he would agree, but it never worried me. It was more just a minor annoyance. 

A few years ago, I started noticing he was on his phone a lot more often than usual, and it was always YouTube videos, but I didn’t question it much. He started talking to his family and friends a lot about random topics like: bigfoot, aliens, chemtrails, the moon landing being fake, the pyramids, etc. I would get annoyed by it but once again, it wasn’t a huge deal yet. 

Then shit completely hit the fan shortly after Trump became president. He went from being a person that NEVER cared about politics, to being this far right sided political “buff” who obsessively watched Trump rally videos every single night on the couch, and agreed with every single thing Trump said. He was sending meme after meme of political garbage, Trump jokes, Biden hating trolls, transphobic and sexist memes, etc. all day every day to almost all of his friends and family. Whenever id try bringing up the fact that I didn’t like that, and I didn’t plan on raising our sons with that mentality, his response was always “It’s a joke. It’s supposed to be funny. You don’t have to make such a big deal out of it.” It was like the person I had known for the previous 6 years was all of a sudden changing before my eyes. He even started voicing frustration about his friends not answering him all the time. I told him it’s because he’s acting obsessive and he’s going to drive his friends away, but he just scoffed at that and used it as reasoning for saying theyre just bad friends and that he doesn’t need them in his life anymore. 

Then covid/quarantine hit and everything went to shit even more. Im a SAHM and was home all day every day with two toddlers, trying to keep everyone healthy and keep myself sane. And all he did was go on his phone all day every day (at work too) and preach to anyone that would listen to him that covid isn’t dangerous “it’s just the flu or a cold”, refusing to wear a mask, Biden/the liberals rigged the election, Trumps going to be president again soon, the vaccine is going to kill or harm everyone, all these celebrities are part of a sex ring and they should be stopped, the list goes on. Every night he would just watch videos on his phone until he fell asleep on the couch, and never slept in bed with me anymore. (He claimed it’s because our mattress hurt his back too much…and when asked why we don’t just get a new mattress he said we can’t afford it right now…) 

Over the summer I got my first dose of the vaccine (after my entire family got it and kept asking if I would get it for my safety) and when I told him he blew up. He started ranting, yelling, swearing and spewing all his “facts” about how many people it’s killed, and how he can’t believe I got it and that I “could be putting him and our kids in jeopardy” and that he doesn’t know if he can ever have sex with me again….I just told him he needed to calm down, that it was my body and my choice, and to stop saying hurtful things, but he kept going anyways. I said “So if you wouldn’t have sex with me, and you’re THIS upset, would you even want to be with me if I get the second dose?” He goes “I don’t know.” I go “You don’t know?? How could you say that?…Look, if you’re serious about this, I’m getting really concerned for you. And I think I’m going to tell one of your brothers or your parents…” He goes “Go ahead!” So I did, and they all (luckily) were on my side and tried telling him how ridiculous he’s being. I made him stay at a friends for the weekend and told him I need space to think about things. When he came home he was very apologetic and crying and I saw a glimmer of who I used to know, and he convinced me to let him come home. I told him we shouldn’t stay together unless he would go to therapy with me (I’ve been going to therapy for 15 years for myself, but I know we needed couples therapy as well) and he said he would never go to therapy but that he would be better and wouldn’t go on his phone as much and he would sleep in bed with me again. For about a week he did those things…then went right back to his old ways soon after. 

I’ve been prone to anxiety my whole life, but it was never affecting my life day to day. This past summer I was having almost daily panic attacks. His beliefs about the vaccine harming me got to my head and gave me MAJOR health anxiety. I went to over 10 doctors appointments and multiple tests and scans, all to determine that I’m perfectly healthy but suffering a lot of stress that’s causing my symptoms. When I tried to have a conversation with him a couple months ago about how much it hurt me all summer that he caused my anxiety, his response was something like “Well I’m really sorry that I upset you and I’m sorry you’ve been having anxiety. I obviously didn’t mean to do that. But I only said all those things about the vaccine because I was extremely scared for you and I care about you and didn’t want you to get it…” which to me was like a backhanded apology. Almost like saying “Sorry I took 5 years off your life, but it was for your own good and because I love you.” 

Fast forward to present day, things have slightly “calmed down” a little: the election is over, covid is still around but becoming “old news”, and his obsessions have slightly calmed down. He is still always a great dad who loves his children dearly. He also solely supports us financially. I can tell he still has love for me, but I just don’t feel a spark or connection with him at all ever since this all started. I don’t feel “safe” with him anymore (as in, I can’t talk to him about a lot of my worries, because he’ll blame them on the vaccine or my family “manipulating me”) , I don’t feel like I did years ago, I don’t trust him when it comes to our health or our children’s health (he’s anti-vax, but I’m not, so they’re vaccinated with all of their regular vaccines) and we have zero sex life or passion (if we do it it’s because I don’t want him to start complaining he never gets any). He still brings up conspiracy fueled thoughts all the time: there’s always a celebrity in a movie we watch that he has a problem with, every time I get our children vaccinated we have a huge fight about it, he lives on his phone a lot, he never sleeps in bed with me, etc. 

One time I made us a couples therapy appointment and told him about the date coming up (hoping he would change his mind). When it came time for our zoom call with the therapist, he refused to join me and I did it alone. When I’ve told him in the past “Do you really want to keep having these same arguments/conversations over and over?…If you refuse couples therapy and never want to try to work on any of this with me then idk if we can make it…” his response is always “So youre just putting an ultimatum on me? That’s controlling. There are other ways we can fix things.” And I go “Like what?” He goes “I don’t know yet.”  🤦🏻‍♀️

I feel like he still loves me, and he does show me he loves me in his own way (doing chores for me, shoveling off my car, doing the grocery shopping, buying me gifts occasionally, texting me throughout the day asking how I’m doing, making me laugh). It’s like I get these “glimmers” of the REAL him sometimes, and I suddenly feel in love with him like I always had. And then my heart breaks when he slips back into this Q person the next day when he gets on a rant about something. I WANT to believe that we are going to make it and that this will all pass. The thought of breaking up our family brings tears to my eyes, my boys ask when he’s coming home all day and they snuggle up and watch a movie together every night, and idk how we could ever not be a family. I’m also a child of divorce, and never pictured my family breaking up like that, it breaks my heart. But some days I just can’t imagine living the rest of my life like this. Constantly trying to avoid the next rant, constantly anxious, constantly hearing fearful worries of his that become my own, no sex life, not sleeping in bed next to the person I love. I’m just so torn and hate this feeling so much. 

Anybody that’s read this whole thing, you’re an angel. I guess I just needed to vent and know that I’m not alone. If anyone has any advice, stories, thoughts, I would appreciate it.

2164,yes,QAnonCasualties,2022-01-25 20:50:39,Trashtvslit,My Q husband and my health anxiety are making me terrified of getting my second covid vaccine. Need help.,"EDIT: I just wanted to say that this is only the second post I’ve made (both in this group) and both times I only expected a response or two, and instead received overwhelmingly positive and helpful support. Thank you all for your continued support 🙏🏻❤️ (Also I made an appointment to get my second dose on Thursday. I just hope I don’t chicken out, because I made an appointment a few weeks ago and ended up canceling it because of my anxious thoughts and fears.) 


So long story short, I have pretty bad health anxiety. I constantly have to fight thoughts that I have a disease or that something is wrong with me. And I question every little thing that goes into my body (most times I won’t even take prescribed medicines from my doctor if I don’t absolutely have to, because I’m afraid it will somehow not agree with my system and hurt me). 

I had a lot of anxiety about getting the first dose of the Covid shot. I hadn’t had a vaccine in like 15 years since I was a kid. But I knew that covid was dangerous enough to warrant getting it, and my entire family was telling me to get it. So I finally did back in July. 

My husband on the other hand…we’ve had a lot of issues because he’s turned into a right sided, Q-led, conspiracy theorist, who believes covid isn’t dangerous and that the vaccine is a way for the government to either control us or kill us 🤦🏻‍♀️ (Here’s the whole story if you want to read) https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/s9jyj6/just_feeling_lost_and_would_love_support_dont/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

When I decided to get the first dose of Pfizer he flipped out and started quoting all of these “facts” about how dangerous it is and how many people have died from it and how it can give you a stroke, heart attack, aneurysm, etc. Because I’m already prone to anxiety, after I got the vaccine, I suffered for months of debilitating panic attacks because every ache or pain I felt, I thought it was the vaccine that was about to kill me or give me some sort of horrible complication. I hate to admit but he got into my head. I had so many heart palpitations, headaches, pains in my head, etc. that I kept thinking was the vaccine (but my family was trying to tell me it was all stress related from my husband). 

To this day I still haven’t gotten the second dose because I’m terrified that after the second dose I’m going to get all of those symptoms and panic attacks again (I’m finally starting to feel back to myself and haven’t been getting panic attacks lately, after months of hard mental work on myself). Every day I’m constantly torn between the fear of getting covid without being fully vaccinated, and the fear of getting vaccinated and causing all sorts of issues. It’s so stressful and taking a huge toll on me.",237,294,294,0.96,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='scnl7n')>,,/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/scnl7n/my_q_husband_and_my_health_anxiety_are_making_me/,,,False

I would gently point out to him that he has a habit of going through phases like this, and sometimes he would agree, but it never worried me. It was more just a minor annoyance. 

A few years ago, I started noticing he was on his phone a lot more often than usual, and it was always YouTube videos, but I didn’t question it much. He started talking to his family and friends a lot about random topics like: bigfoot, aliens, chemtrails, the moon landing being fake, the pyramids, etc. I would get annoyed by it but once again, it wasn’t a huge deal yet. 

Then shit completely hit the fan shortly after Trump became president. He went from being a person that NEVER cared about politics, to being this far right sided political “buff” who obsessively watched Trump rally videos every single night on the couch, and agreed with every single thing Trump said. He was sending meme after meme of political garbage, Trump jokes, Biden hating trolls, transphobic and sexist memes, etc. all day every day to almost all of his friends and family. Whenever id try bringing up the fact that I didn’t like that, and I didn’t plan on raising our sons with that mentality, his response was always “It’s a joke. It’s supposed to be funny. You don’t have to make such a big deal out of it.” It was like the person I had known for the previous 6 years was all of a sudden changing before my eyes. He even started voicing frustration about his friends not answering him all the time. I told him it’s because he’s acting obsessive and he’s going to drive his friends away, but he just scoffed at that and used it as reasoning for saying theyre just bad friends and that he doesn’t need them in his life anymore. 

Then covid/quarantine hit and everything went to shit even more. Im a SAHM and was home all day every day with two toddlers, trying to keep everyone healthy and keep myself sane. And all he did was go on his phone all day every day (at work too) and preach to anyone that would listen to him that covid isn’t dangerous “it’s just the flu or a cold”, refusing to wear a mask, Biden/the liberals rigged the election, Trumps going to be president again soon, the vaccine is going to kill or harm everyone, all these celebrities are part of a sex ring and they should be stopped, the list goes on. Every night he would just watch videos on his phone until he fell asleep on the couch, and never slept in bed with me anymore. (He claimed it’s because our mattress hurt his back too much…and when asked why we don’t just get a new mattress he said we can’t afford it right now…) 

Over the summer I got my first dose of the vaccine (after my entire family got it and kept asking if I would get it for my safety) and when I told him he blew up. He started ranting, yelling, swearing and spewing all his “facts” about how many people it’s killed, and how he can’t believe I got it and that I “could be putting him and our kids in jeopardy” and that he doesn’t know if he can ever have sex with me again….I just told him he needed to calm down, that it was my body and my choice, and to stop saying hurtful things, but he kept going anyways. I said “So if you wouldn’t have sex with me, and you’re THIS upset, would you even want to be with me if I get the second dose?” He goes “I don’t know.” I go “You don’t know?? How could you say that?…Look, if you’re serious about this, I’m getting really concerned for you. And I think I’m going to tell one of your brothers or your parents…” He goes “Go ahead!” So I did, and they all (luckily) were on my side and tried telling him how ridiculous he’s being. I made him stay at a friends for the weekend and told him I need space to think about things. When he came home he was very apologetic and crying and I saw a glimmer of who I used to know, and he convinced me to let him come home. I told him we shouldn’t stay together unless he would go to therapy with me (I’ve been going to therapy for 15 years for myself, but I know we needed couples therapy as well) and he said he would never go to therapy but that he would be better and wouldn’t go on his phone as much and he would sleep in bed with me again. For about a week he did those things…then went right back to his old ways soon after. 

I’ve been prone to anxiety my whole life, but it was never affecting my life day to day. This past summer I was having almost daily panic attacks. His beliefs about the vaccine harming me got to my head and gave me MAJOR health anxiety. I went to over 10 doctors appointments and multiple tests and scans, all to determine that I’m perfectly healthy but suffering a lot of stress that’s causing my symptoms. When I tried to have a conversation with him a couple months ago about how much it hurt me all summer that he caused my anxiety, his response was something like “Well I’m really sorry that I upset you and I’m sorry you’ve been having anxiety. I obviously didn’t mean to do that. But I only said all those things about the vaccine because I was extremely scared for you and I care about you and didn’t want you to get it…” which to me was like a backhanded apology. Almost like saying “Sorry I took 5 years off your life, but it was for your own good and because I love you.” 

Fast forward to present day, things have slightly “calmed down” a little: the election is over, covid is still around but becoming “old news”, and his obsessions have slightly calmed down. He is still always a great dad who loves his children dearly. He also solely supports us financially. I can tell he still has love for me, but I just don’t feel a spark or connection with him at all ever since this all started. I don’t feel “safe” with him anymore (as in, I can’t talk to him about a lot of my worries, because he’ll blame them on the vaccine or my family “manipulating me”) , I don’t feel like I did years ago, I don’t trust him when it comes to our health or our children’s health (he’s anti-vax, but I’m not, so they’re vaccinated with all of their regular vaccines) and we have zero sex life or passion (if we do it it’s because I don’t want him to start complaining he never gets any). He still brings up conspiracy fueled thoughts all the time: there’s always a celebrity in a movie we watch that he has a problem with, every time I get our children vaccinated we have a huge fight about it, he lives on his phone a lot, he never sleeps in bed with me, etc. 

I feel like he still loves me, and he does show me he loves me in his own way (doing chores for me, shoveling off my car, doing the grocery shopping, buying me gifts occasionally, texting me throughout the day asking how I’m doing, making me laugh). It’s like I get these “glimmers” of the REAL him sometimes, and I suddenly feel in love with him like I always had. And then my heart breaks when he slips back into this Q person the next day when he gets on a rant about something. I WANT to believe that we are going to make it and that this will all pass. The thought of breaking up our family brings tears to my eyes, my boys ask when he’s coming home all day and they snuggle up and watch a movie together every night, and idk how we could ever not be a family. I’m also a child of divorce, and never pictured my family breaking up like that, it breaks my heart. But some days I just can’t imagine living the rest of my life like this. Constantly trying to avoid the next rant, constantly anxious, constantly hearing fearful worries of his that become my own, no sex life, not sleeping in bed next to the person I love. I’m just so torn and hate this feeling so much. 

Anybody that’s read this whole thing, you’re an angel. I guess I just needed to vent and know that I’m not alone. If anyone has any advice, stories, thoughts, I would appreciate it. Thank you ❤️



Edit: Wow, I was going to be happy if I got 3-5 responses. I feel so supported and I appreciate you all so much. I’m going to take my time reading every single comment. 

Also (because a lot of you suggested it) I’ve been going to therapy myself for about 15 years. I love it and it’s done wonders for me. My husband has never been to therapy and absolutely refuses it. One time I made us a couples therapy appointment and told him about the date coming up (hoping he would change his mind). When it came time for our zoom call with the therapist, he refused to join me and I did it alone. When I’ve told him in the past “Do you really want to keep having these same arguments/conversations over and over?…If you refuse couples therapy and never want to try to work on any of this with me then idk if we can make it…” his response is always “So youre just putting an ultimatum on me? That’s controlling. There are other ways we can fix things.” And I go “Like what?” He goes “I don’t know yet.”  🤦🏻‍♀️",166,695,695,0.99,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='s9jyj6')>,,/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/s9jyj6/just_feeling_lost_and_would_love_support_dont/,,,False

2174,yes,CasualConversation,2023-05-04 14:59:48,Riksor,I don't know how to treat people with mobility impairments,"So, the golden rule of ethics is to do onto others what you'd want to be done for yourself. This makes sense most of the time: don't be a jerk. Be nice. Do nice things. I try to follow this in all of my life. But I'm completely stumped on how to treat people on crutches or those with mobility issues.






I'm disabled. It's mostly invisible but it does impair my movement and hurt a lot. I've been on crutches before because of it, and when I was, I couldn't stand it when people opened doors and stuff for me. I understand they were trying to be nice, but it made me feel infantilized, I guess--even if it was more complicated I was still entirely capable of opening doors, picking up things off the ground, and doing everything I needed to do. It made me feel like a burden onto others. I still hate it when people treat me extra nicely because of my disability. 






When I see someone on crutches or in a wheelchair approach, for instance, a closed door, what am I supposed to do? Golden rule says I should ignore them because that's what I would want in their position. But maybe I should be doing the 'nicer' thing by offering help or stepping in to help?

2179,yes,fantasywriters,2023-04-15 13:49:28,Riksor,"Feedback on these premises, please!","I'm a biology student, so evolution and zoology are two things I'm extremely passionate about. Life on earth is so extremely interesting and I want what I love about zoology/evolution to show in my writing. I've done this before with short stories and things have turned out well, but I'm struggling to translate the fusion of English and fantastical soft science into a novel-length idea.

I've come up with several different biology-inspired fantasy premises and I'm not sure what to focus on. If someone could please tell me your favorite or any other input you can provide, I'd appreciate it a ton.

(These stories all have themes, emotional conflict, characters, etc but I'm cutting those so you don't have to read too much)

1. Animal fantasy - In this world, all tetrapods are sapient. Mammals, reptiles (including birds), and amphibians can all communicate with one another and exist in a society together. They have more or less mutually agreed that only non-tetrapods, like fish and insects, can be eaten. I think it'd be extremely interesting to explore different cultures of animals and speculate on how they'd behave, what they'd believe, how they deal with their instincts, etc. I'd also want to include more objective fantasy elements--I was thinking, for example, that because rats are both extremely compassionate/social and have short lives, they would have a system similar to Catholic saints where they deify each other after death, and that these deities would be 'real' to them. There'd also be some mystery about when this takes place in earth's history and how non-human animals even gained human intelligence and communication.I'm passionate about this idea, but non-humanoid animals walking around in little civilizations, sometimes with powers, is probably not very interesting to most people, and I do care a little about marketability.
2. Contemporary fantasy - I thought it'd be cool to do a middle grade book where kids obtain the powers to transform into any members of a certain clade. For example, one could turn into any member of felidae, the cat family. I have more for this premise but I don't think it's that interesting. All members of a clade tend to have the same basic adaptations so it would be difficult to showcase interesting creatures, especially those that don't have broad clades like pangolins or colugos.
3. Contemporary Magical Girl-Inspired Fantasy - This is intended for middle grade, and is the story I've developed/written the most. On planets with sapient life, like earth, an interdimensional World Tree sprouts. This tree spawns pocket dimensions--""fruits""--based on concepts: love, war, famine; vampires, werewolves, dragons, etc. When a concept is no longer widely believed in or cared about, the fruit 'dies' and leaves behind a Seed.A magical alien cat selects three middle schoolers to be guardians against a mysterious entity ravaging worlds and their world trees known as the Blight. He gives one a Berserker Seed, one a Elemental Seed, and the other a Magician Seed. These kids must juggle their school and homelives while also fighting off the mysterious Blight. They must also avoid getting corrupted by the Blight themselves.
4. Modern day dragons - I wrote a good chunk of this years ago but gave up on it. This is also middle grade. Premise: dragons used to exist, but evolved to take human forms and still exist in the real world. The main character discovers he's a dragon. There are different species of dragons with adaptations inspired by real-life animals, and I was thinking perhaps there'd be six basic 'elements:' not water, air, fire, earth, water, but gaseous, plasma, solids, liquids: oilslick dragons and mercury, bismuth and titanium dragons, electricity and fire dragons, dragons as light as helium or as toxic and heavy as Hydrogen Flouride, etc. There would be a secret fifth element based on dark matter which would deal with gravity powers. When all five elements are combined (by killing and chopping off body parts and Frankensteining them together) an ultimate 'Pendragon' is created. The overarching goal would be to stop the creation of a pendragon by a cultist group.

My professor has urged me to try to get two of them published and has made a list of some literary magazines I should submit to, including some relatively big ones like Orion.

I don't expect to actually get accepted for a well-established magazine like that, especially not as an undergrad with zero previous publications and little experience. I'd throw my hat in the ring regardless, but none of them are open to submissions at the moment.

On Submittable, there's a Discover tab full of tiny, new, independent literary magazines. I've been reading through them and they're very cool. It's evident a lot of them are created by impassioned people. I've prepared cover letters for these ones but I'm hesitant to click submit.

To my understanding, if I submit to these smaller publications, I lose the ability to publish the same piece anywhere else. What happens then if the publication dies, as these smaller ones often do? Do I lose the ability to publish it elsewhere even if it's no longer viewable?

2187,yes,worldbuilding,2023-03-22 04:39:48,Riksor,Seeking feedback on a middle grade power system idea,"I've been working on a middle grade book for a while but I keep changing the lore behind the power system because I think my previous ideas are cringe. This one might be too, but regardless I'd like feedback on the newest iteration. 





The universe is full of solar systems, which are full of planets. In planets where life exists, a world tree also grows. 





The world tree isn't an actual thing, but it's a simplified way to view the nature of reality. The more life a planet bolsters, the stronger its tree. The more ideas, emotions, concepts, etc that the life generates, the more 'fruit' sprouts from the tree.





On earth, there is a 'fruit'--which is really a sort of world or pocket dimension--for everything deemed real or important in the public consciousness. For instance, ghosts and their world are real because a massive amount of people still believe in them. Cats are worshipped more than the Greek gods nowadays, and their world--and any beings from their world--would be more powerful than Zeus. On the other hand, werewolves aren't real anymore, but they used to be. Since nobody really believes in them anymore, the concept of werewolves withered away, and so did its world/fruit. The worlds are like pocket dimensions and beings from these fruits can infiltrate the 'normal' world, but only through 'nodes,' or portals, on the earth--and vice versa.







When a fruit is destroyed, it leaves behind a seed. These seeds--called stones--are distillations of the world/concept they came from. Those in possession of a stone gain abilities based on the concept. Someone who has the magician stone, for instance, might be able to perform illusion magic, or someone with a werewolf stone could shapeshift. The existence of these seeds means that the worlds/concepts that have withered away can be restored. If someone was using the werewolf seed and the public saw it, werewolves could once again flourish in the public mind and the world could be resurrected.






There also exists a strange viral force in the universe called blight that infects world trees. When a 'fruit' is destroyed by the blight, it is corrupted entirely and cannot ever be restored. The blight consists of dead ideas, dead people, and half-infected owners of stones. The blight is mysterious, but turns people and ideas violent. It seems to eradicate earth and the world tree.






I'd appreciate any feedback or ideas. Thank you!",3,6,6,0.81,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='11y754w')>,,/r/worldbuilding/comments/11y754w/seeking_feedback_on_a_middle_grade_power_system/,,,False

Don't get me wrong, I adore the concept of fantasy races. I wouldn't like DnD, Elder Scrolls, etc nearly as much if their worlds were solely populated by humans. 









As you likely know, the idea of fantasy races is that some are naturally more stealthy, cunning, lucky, etc than others, and often have diverse cultures or biologies that have them behaving in different ways. It's a fun contrast, for instance, to have an argonian talk about their hatching-day and first trip away from the Hist in a conversation at a tavern full of humans.








 I want to include fantasy races in my work, but I'm not sure how to do so in a way that is both entertaining, and not harmful. Some might say something like, ""obviously big green orcs and talking cat-men don't exist in real life, so this is a non-issue."" I'd like to believe this is the case, but it stills feels wrong to present some beings with inherent facets of their personalities or abilities dictated by their race. For instance, I think it's really great that DnD is removing the 'inherent evilness' of certain races. At the same time, it's boring to strip fantasy races of everything unique about them, and describing them in terms of stereotypes may also be a non-solution.







My ideas are:








1. Not use the term race at all, and not allow 'halfbreeds' like half-elves or half-orcs (perhaps outside of actual biological hybrid animals). The point is to very explicitly separate humans from other humanoid creatures, and describe them as totally separate species rather than races. 









2. Describe races as tendencies instead of rules. ""Dwarves tend to be crafty and dexterous,"" but they're not always. 








3. Describe racial features purely by biology and culture. ""Aarakocra, being a winged race, typically have societies in the mountains or other places of high elevation. Their cultures place a large emphasis on the joys of solitude, being geographically separated from other races. Most aarakocra are self-proclaimed loners and take pride in their independence."" 








4. Get rid of race 'bonuses' in terms of intelligence, dexterity, strength, etc, and simply define them aesthetically or culturally.







5. Give each race a defining trait (eg aarakocra have wings, humans are highly adaptable, elves have long lifespans) but with no other expectations of culture, ability, etc outside of what forms from these biological differences.








How do you all manage the ethics of fantasy races in your works?

It would've been even cooler to have actual ecosystems! The jellyfish and anglerfish populations really make no sense from a biology perspective, and neither do the cacti. Giant's Deep could've been so interesting and full of life since it's protected from ghost matter, but all that exist there are oversized electrovorous(?) jellyfish. Even just changing the trees to be a different color than green (as the green color is what's most efficient for earth's light levels, not necessarily for other planets) could've made the game feel more interesting to me.

\-The alien cultures felt much too 'earth.' Hearthian society looks exactly like the Midwest, which could've been fine if they're analogous to humans. But the Stranger's inhabitants, too, just look like they're from a Western earth society. The beds on the Stranger are unique and interesting, for instance, but I wish there were more stuff like that. Instead, the aliens in this game have things extremely similar to us: dressing screens, picture frames, chairs like ours, dishware like ours, tables like ours, etc. The way the Nomai 'talk' is, again, just too familiar in my opinion. I would've liked it if the translations were more imperfect or foreign to the reader.

\-The jellyfish puzzle felt really strange. I had all the clues, but couldn't put them together. I know you can climb inside the jellyfish, but they're depicted in-game to have electricity around their tentacles (and their tentacles are often lethal IRL of course). I tried to kill the jellyfish, to climb inside with the ship, etc before realizing you just simply go inside.

\-The NPC dialogue. The NPCs are overall well-done but I wish there were more dialogue options that update with your gained knowledge. I always felt rushed by the time-loop so I didn't interact much with Chert and Riebeck regardless. The NPCs play such a pivotal role in the ending and theme of the game that anything to improve player attachment to them would've been really welcomed.

\-The DLC was amazing storywise, but felt a little frustrating to me when the dream world was involved. Granted, I played it before the nerf. I'm sad it didn't utilize the spaceship, but there isn't much that can be done about that.

Anyways, that's all my criticism/nitpicks/things-that-could've-been-done-better. 

Also I know there's not going to be an Outer Wilds 2 or additional DLC, but how cool would it be to have a spooky puzzle game that takes place entirely within Dark Bramble, exploring its nodes and locations? :)",233,144,144,0.96,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='w4pzsx')>,,/r/outerwilds/comments/w4pzsx/what_dont_you_like_about_outer_wilds/,,,False
2262,yes,CatAdvice,2022-07-21 16:05:06,Riksor,"Kitten choked on his collar, what to do? Should I put it back on?","I'm entirely new to cat ownership. My family adopted a little kitten when he was 7 weeks (he is a rescue, we're told his mom died) and things have been going great. He came to us with fleas and an infected eye but he's all better now, eats well, is super energetic, etc. He's 11 or 12 weeks now. 

We got him a blue breakaway collar for kittens from Walmart. It has a bell so we can keep track of where he goes. We tested it, it breaks away just fine. He's had no issues with it until today.

Today, I noticed him acting super strangely--jumping around frantically, pawing at his collar. I ran over and he was making weird noises/gurgles. I looked and the collar seemed super tight against his fur. Immediately I 'broke away' the collar and he was acting fine after that, and just wanted to have the collar back so he could play with the bell and nametag. 

My mom (the true cat owner, I just live at home during summer) wants to put the collar back on, but I'm terrified he'll choke himself again when I'm not around to help him and I'm not letting her until I get some advice.

The name tag attached to the collar is custom-made by my brother and pretty large and reflective, so maybe he was trying to play with that and choked himself. Or maybe the issue was the bell, but the bell is pretty tight against the collar band. 

Is he too young to have a breakaway collar? Is it safe to use one? Is this a fluke or serious issue? Should I remove the nametag if I continue collar use?

I keep his collar loose enough to fit two fingers beneath it. Maybe that's too tight/loose?

2264,yes,The10thDentist,2022-07-14 13:14:28,Riksor,it's okay for people to eat dogs.,"In some cultures/regions, eating dogs is somewhat normal and dogs are raised as food.







In USAmerica, this is very looked down upon and we have charities and activism groups just to stop this practice in other countries. 








Would I ever eat a dog? No. Do we have a right to tell other cultures that they're immoral for it? No, especially because we have factory farming practices in this nation that torture other animals on a super large scale. Pigs are smarter than dogs and we do far worse to them. Cows are sacred to some cultures and we'd be offended if one of those cultures came over and tried to get us to stop farming cows for it being immoral. Our egg industry in the US literally shreds baby male chicks alive, but other cultures are going too far for eating dogs? 








""Dogs weren't domesticated for food,"" well in the US we also raise lions, alligators, etc for food on smaller scales. We could focus on stopping that in our nation before flying to another country to stop their practices. 







I think it's very cringe for us to spend thousands on flying to other nations just to tell them to stop doing something we deem unacceptable, particularly when we have our own issues with animal maltreatment. It's like a form of colonialism. Just because you have your little furbaby Luna or Fido doesn't give you the right to tell other cultures they're being immoral by default.

Two are middle grade: a Watership Down/Warriors-style animal fantasy political story about dinosaur civilizations coping with natural inequalities and the oncoming meteor at the end of the Cretaceous, and an existential slightly-power-fantasy-y 'magical girl' book about a group of girls and boys suddenly given powers with the task to protect earth as the remaining beacon of extant life in the universe. The other two are YA: a post-'zombie' Apocalypse book about dehumanization, recovery, and coping with change told with an abusive antagonist lead, and a Celtic mythology fantasy adventure about a medieval peasant trying to rescue her dad from the underworld, with a lesbian romance subplot and commentary on nihilism and the purpose of living. 

I use 'in the works' lightly because they're only partially written. I keep bouncing between them. Even though they're outlined and I have thousands of words written and some chapters workshopped/reviewed, none of them are even yet half-way complete.

Every time I try to write, I get discouraged with one idea and swap to the next. I get so worried that I'm wasting time on a bad idea nobody else will like. And I hate jumping around because I feel like it takes me out of my flow and that I'd like to finish at least one work, just as practice.

No one even mentioned paying me back until I brought it up. And still haven't been paid back. Plus so much more in post,"There was a concert that was gonna sell out fast (my friends love the artist and so do i). I tell my friends about the concert and we're all excited. We hang out and they agree to pay me back so I buy 3 tickets while we're hanging out. Total, they were $300. 

When it comes close to concert time, I arrive to my friend's house on time. I checked a million times and the concert started at 7. My other friend doesn't even arrive until 8:30.

We finally get to the concert at 9:00 and it's over by the time we get there. My friends really didn't care at all. Because they had no intention at all of ever paying me back for those tickets...

The money itself isn't what bothers me, it's the principle. I shouldn't have to remind someone to pay me back for a $100 ticket. I reminded them a few times, but I shouldn't have to beg to be paid back. Let alone 2 fucking people. These two people are always acting entitled to my belongings. Whether it be money, my time, food, rides, mental space, literally anything. And I'm so fucking sick of being disrespected.

The thing is tho.....it feels like everyone eventually starts to treat me like this. If I want friends, it seems like I have to settle for people that will be ""the least"" rude to me if that makes sense. I am so sick of it. I don't want to become bitter but it's hard.

I am now 31 but when I was in 11th grade, one of my best friends ended their life (we'll call her J)

A few weeks after J died, one of my friends and I took MDMA together.

One of J's favorite artists was owl city. This was before he got popular/ sold out when his music was actually good. I know people talk shit about owl city and for good reason..... but listen to his early music 

Anyways, I was listening to a song by owl city and began singing along. As I sang along, I could literally feel J's presence. Not only was my own voice coming out my mouth, but J's voice was coming out of my mouth as well. She was singing along to the song with me but her voice was coming out of me if that makes sense. I could feel her soul/energy/voice inside of me as I sang along and it was beautiful 

I spent the rest of the night listening to her favorite music/singing along and it was really therapeutic. this was by far the most spiritual experience I've ever had on a substance.

So yeah lol that's my story. I wish I could remember more but it was a really long time ago. Has anyone ever had an experience like this with music on mdma? I think listening to nostalgic music on mdma can lead to very spiritual experiences. Memories are linked to music and MDMA can really bring those memories to the next level

Edit: the song is ""Rainbow Veins"" by Owl City ❤

My GM called me into his office today and said a bunch of rude stuff. Accused me of doing things I didn't do, etc. Asked if I'd be willing to switch departments. I don't want to switch departments. 

The things he said made no sense and he never watches me work. So I started to think, this evil coworker is probably saying things to him. She has gotten 2 other coworkers out of our department already and they weren't even bad, they were good workers.

My GM said to bring him a ""decision"" (idk what that means) by Friday. I didn't think of this until now but I would so much rather switch stores. 

How do I go about asking? My GM clearly wants me to stay since he wants me to switch departments... I don't understand why he doesn't just fire me, the talk we had was so weird. 

Do I mention this coworker? I'm thinking not. I was just thinking of saying ""would you be willing to transfer me to a different store? I'm moving near there anyways so it would work better for me"" or do I say the real thing? ""I feel like there's something you're not telling me since everything you accused me of doing is untrue.

Be careful with who you tell about your current/past addictions...,"Sooooo my coworker asked if I had any weed I could spare.

Next day, I give her the hash. As I hand it over, I joke ""just remember it's hash! It's not heroin or anything lol"". She laughs and accepts it. 

Next day, I see her and ask, ""how'd you like the hash?"" She goes, ""oh I thought it could be heroin so I threw it away""

I have been on the fence with how I feel about this coworker for WEEKS and this truly confirms the feelings I've been having about her. She fucking suuuuuuucks

When she first started, we were homies. Then she got promoted and her demeanor changed completely.  I had told her that I used to be a heroin addict cuz I thought we were cool.  We even hung out outside of work one time and smoked weed. But telling her that was my biggest mistake.  She is not cool at all, actually quite the opposite.  But she presents herself as an accepting ""down"" person.

By her assuming I gave her heroin, she effectively communicated a lot of things:

A) you think I still use heroin regularly,  even though I told you it was in the past 

B) you have no respect for my belongings 

C) you think I'm capable of murdering someone 

D) you're a narc and a drama queen

E) are you telling other coworkers that I'm a junkie? Are you telling people I actively use heroin while at work?

Really fucking pissed me off. She knew damn well that wasn't heroin. Just smell it and you'll see it's hash, it literally smells like weed....  ugh. And now I have to work with this dumbass every single day. Even if she thought it was H, she could've lied. I would never accuse someone of that when recieving something for free.

Even in neurodivergent friendgroups","I am ""nice"" to a fault. I believe my kindness is genuine but at the same time, I'm a horrible communicator and self advocate. I'm literally incapable of standing up for myself and I hate it. Resentment builds in me and that is not nice. I need to learn to set boundaries so this resentment doesn't take over my life. I sometimes wonder if I'm actually a know-it-all judgemental asshole and my ""kindness"" is a coping mechanism or something. When I was young, my kindness was so genuine. But now that I'm 30 and an adult, that authenticity is going away and it breaks my heart 

I am forgetful, clumsy, goofy, ditsy,, etc. People are nice to me at first but eventually everyone treats me like a clueless idiot. Because ......I am. I'm not an idiot but I am very forgetful.  

I've made a group of friends and I'm beginning to see the patsy pattern emerge yet again. I smoke cigs/weed and always accidentally pocket people's lighters. I don't do it consciously, it's literally muscle memory or something. And people are beginning to make fun of me for it. I know it's harmless and coming from a place of good faith but I still don't love it. Yes I am difficult sometimes but I still deserve respect. For now it's just lighter jokes. But what will this evolve into. 

All of my best friendships have been one-on-one. People don't pick on me when it's just me and another person. But in a group, people talk and they feed off of each other. It's not them. It's me. Because it happens in literally every fucking situation I'm ever in. I can't stand it. 

I also think trauma has something to do with my forgetfulness, not just ND. I've read trauma can literally cause brain damage and I feel like I have brain damage from unprocessed trauma. The body keeps the score

Sorry for the all over the place shitpost. But yeah. I hate being the patsy in every group setting. I know I'm not dumb. But I do know my unhealthy coping mechanisms and the way I present myself. I wish people could accept the fact that I'm forgetful and goofy and not take advantage of it. 

I have heard so many people say to me ""literally everyone loves you"". One of my friends told me I'm ""disarming"" as one of my good qualities. At first I took it as a compliment but I feel like he means people can treat me like a doormat and I won't fire back. I'm a good person to take your anger out on. I genuinely don't want to fire back. I'm incapable of being ""mean"" and it sucks. But society turns people into sharks and idk how to deal with it.

How many of you late dx folks identify with those who were dx early? How many of you autistic folks who are Levels 2 & 3 according to the DSM can relate to those who are Level 1? Do you see us as all autistic or something else?

While there may SEEM to be a huge chasm between these groups, I believe that this is due to the insistence of NT society along with the medical, educational, and psychological industries and decades of indoctrination and internalized ideas of what is or isn't autistic. We have a lot more in common with each other than we are led to believe. Of course, not all of our experiences are the same and not all of us can relate to the same things as the other.

We have vastly different experiences and understandings of ourselves and what autism is. Some of us will not be able to relate to the positivity and the ideas of autistic joy, while others of us cannot understand why people can possible think that autism is a not disability. Some have been masking their whole lives, others don't know what the concept even is. Some will get extremely angry when we speak about our struggles, and others equally angry if we speak about the positive aspects of being autistic. Some argue that those of us who work cannot understand those who don't, and vice versa. That our struggles aren't the same. Indeed, all of our struggles are NOT the same.

But somewhere in between all of these things, however, exists a common thread. A common experience of relating to the world and how it relates to us. A shared experience and angst living in the NT world. I believe that the labels that are given to us by those who aren't autistic put us into camps from a very young age or early stage of learning about our autistic selves. We internalize them. We believe them. We recognize their truth, while also seeing their flaws. If I'm not making sense to you yet, stick with me. I am not a wordsmith and I have issues communicating and getting my thoughts out in a coherent way all the time. That won't stop me, however, from trying. 

Whether the labels are about function, supports needs, masking level, ability to maintain social norms, or whatever, we recognize that we all have different ways of looking & being in the world and also can (but not necessarily) have trouble seeing the world thru another's eyes. Supports needs, functioning levels, masking levels, all can change over time. They are not static. They should not be a way to measure who we speak to and who we relate to more or less. These things can, and often do, change in either direction.

Now I'll get personal. I was dx (with Asperger’s) at 3 years old. I went thru the Special Education system and ABA for my formative years before being ""mainstreamed"". I was a ""success"" according to the educational, medical, and behavioral models of how we look at autistic people. Their goal is to make us ""less a problem"" to allistic adults as we get older. It left me with scars & trauma that I'm still dealing with 30+ years later, but OK, ""mission accomplished"". I moved to a new country and had to be re-diagnosed. While the “autism levels” did not exist when I was diagnosed as a child, the world has changed. People often think of those who were originally diagnosed with “Asperger’s Syndrome” as “Level 1 ASD” , but that isn’t necessarily the case. In my situation, it wasn’t. I was now, 30 years later, being diagnosed as “Level 2”, meaning I have significant supports needs.

Despite being a ""Level 2 Autistic"" I can live ""independently"" and therefore have ""low"" needs to an outsider, much like many who were originally diagnosed with “Asperger’s”. Sure, I can tie my shoes (poorly), remember to use the bathroom (usually), and work (sometimes). But I still have needs. I'm still legally & medically classified as ""Level 2"". Only I (and often my partner) can truly see that. 

To the outside, and even to most of you, I'm ""good"". I have meltdowns often, cannot get out of bed for days at a time, have had major periods of Autistic Burnout in my life, get hurt on an almost daily basis, almost hit by cars on a weekly basis, cannot deal with even the most basic requests, need to be reminded to eat and bathe, etc If I didn't have the supports that I & my partner have enabled for myself, I'd be on the street. Probably dead. I think of that often.

The country in which I live provides little to no support for ANY autistic people, even those with the highest needs for support. What's worse, is that to the outsider, to the random onlooker here on social media, I am a ""success"". I am a coach. To some of you, I am a faker or even a con artist, taking advantage of autistic people. The reality is is that I am neither a success or a con artist. I'm simply an autistic human in my late 30's who has been struggling and living in a NT world for a long time. I'm simply one of the ""lucky"" ones who was forced and abused into complying who can speak to others about my experiences in the hope to change them for others. I'm simply an autistic person who ""did what was asked"" of autistic people by NT society and now needs to deal with the consequences of being simultaneously rejected by NT society as an autistic person and ""not being autistic enough"" as well as by parts of the autistic community for being ""low supports needs"" and even by many in the late dx community as ""too negative"" about the deficits of being autistic. No matter what I say or do, someone will be angry. Someone will place be in another box that isn't theirs. I want us to stop building boxes.

I want all autistic people to know about the experiences of others that aren't like their own. I want hyperlexic autistic folks to speak with those who aren't verbal. I want those who go to university to speak with those who don't. I want those who live independently to understand those who live in an institution. I want those of us who are utterly disabled by being autistic to speak to us who don't think that way. I want those who experience pure autistic joy to sit and understand those on the other end. Because we DO all have a common thread. Something which unites us, which is why we all ARE autistic. I want us to TRY to not internalize what everyone tells us what we are and what we should be. THAT is why I do this work. Because I have seen ""both ends of the spectrum”. Precisely because I have friends and family who are both ""autistic superheroes"" who advocate for themselves and others who cannot even begin to know what the concept of self-advocacy is. We are all different, but we are all in the same boat too.

The more we are divided the more our rights and lives will be violated by those who wish to change us or remove us from society and the world. This isn't hyperbole, but something we all know is happening on a daily basis. That isn't to say that all allistic people want us dead or want to hurt us. Clearly not. But the system in which we live isn't supporting us and there are absolutely plenty of organizations and individuals who are ACTIVELY seeking to harm us. The majority are indifferent. Yes, I know that I will receive flack for this. I know I will be called an ableist (for different reasons), an idiot, someone who doesn't know how to communicate ""properly"", a charlatan, someone who ""doesn't get it"", privileged, and someone who hurts autistic people for profit. I'm used to it. I'm invalidated on a daily, invalidated by thousands on a monthly basis. AND SO ARE ALL OF YOU. I simply get it publicly for all to see. But we are all invalidated daily and it hurts. I want that to change and that's why I do what I do.

And yes, I am privileged. In that I am a white-passing MENA cis male holding a formal dx. I have it as good as almost anyone in the autistic community in terms of safety and privilege. I use that platform to speak up for those who don't have that same privilege. And yes, I am also victimized for being autistic. For being a non Christian in a Christian society. For speaking or walking and acting differently. Treated like a second-class citizen because I am multi-disabled. Like all things, there is nuance. The biggest nuance, to me, in terms of everything here, is that being autistic is complicated. There is no absolute. That can be hard for many of us who think in binary absolutes. I'm like that myself naturally, but I know that the world is more complicated. Humans are complicated.

Autistic people are all humans. We aren't one-size fits all and we all have different, yet shared struggles. This is amplified for those of us who aren't white cis males and have other disabilities and/or impairments. Anyway, I recognize that this may seem like rambling now and someone will get angry for my lack of being clear. So I will leave it to those who want to discuss these topics, and the nuance of being autistic in different ways while sharing a common thread to reply as they see fit.

And for the various naysayers - I am formally dx as Level 2, but recognize self DX as more than legitimate due to too many reasons to be listed here. I have both lived independently AND with others for support. I have studied in university and worked in a F/T high pressure job AND been unemployed and on benefits. I have been institutionalized and hospitalized in my life AND been a mentor to those who are in institutions & hospitals. I know how to travel by myself but also need to take weeks to mentally prepare and even then, often cannot handle it. I know what it's like to have a meltdown in public and be harmed by the police for it. I know what it's like to be picked on, shamed, blamed, and harmed. I am proud and happy to be autistic but also know the great challenges and pain that come along with it. I live in the grey spaces and nuance. It's there that we can relate to each other, even if we seem differently from afar. I know what it's like to be an autistic person who has both been removed from society & as one who has built an independent life. I see both ends and have lived it. That's why I do the advocacy work that I do.",18,46,46,0.91,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13lzx5d')>,,/r/autism/comments/13lzx5d/lets_break_down_divisions_in_the_autistic/,,,False

Whether the labels are about function, supports needs, masking level, ability to maintain social norms, or whatever, we recognize that we all have different ways of looking & being in the world and also can (but not necessarily) have trouble seeing the world thru another's eyes. Supports needs, functioning levels, masking levels, all can change over time. They are not static. They should not be a way to measure who we speak to and who we relate to more or less. These things can, and often do, change in either direction.

Now I'll get personal. I was dx (with Asperger’s) at 3 years old. I went thru the Special Education system and ABA for my formative years before being ""mainstreamed"". I was a ""success"" according to the educational, medical, and behavioral models of how we look at autistic people. Their goal is to make us ""less a problem"" to allistic adults as we get older. It left me with scars & trauma that I'm still dealing with 30+ years later, but OK, ""mission accomplished"". I moved to a new country and had to be re-diagnosed. While the “autism levels” did not exist when I was diagnosed as a child, the world has changed. People often think of those who were originally diagnosed with “Asperger’s Syndrome” as “Level 1 ASD” , but that isn’t necessarily the case. In my situation, it wasn’t. I was now, 30 years later, being diagnosed as “Level 2”, meaning I have significant supports needs.

Despite being a ""Level 2 Autistic"" I can live ""independently"" and therefore have ""low"" needs to an outsider, much like many who were originally diagnosed with “Asperger’s”. Sure, I can tie my shoes (poorly), remember to use the bathroom (usually), and work (sometimes). But I still have needs. I'm still legally & medically classified as ""Level 2"". Only I (and often my partner) can truly see that. 

To the outside, and even to most of you, I'm ""good"". I have meltdowns often, cannot get out of bed for days at a time, have had major periods of Autistic Burnout in my life, get hurt on an almost daily basis, almost hit by cars on a weekly basis, cannot deal with even the most basic requests, need to be reminded to eat and bathe, etc If I didn't have the supports that I & my partner have enabled for myself, I'd be on the street. Probably dead. I think of that often.

The country in which I live provides little to no support for ANY autistic people, even those with the highest needs for support. What's worse, is that to the outsider, to the random onlooker here on social media, I am a ""success"". I am a coach. To some of you, I am a faker or even a con artist, taking advantage of autistic people. The reality is is that I am neither a success or a con artist. I'm simply an autistic human in my late 30's who has been struggling and living in a NT world for a long time. I'm simply one of the ""lucky"" ones who was forced and abused into complying who can speak to others about my experiences in the hope to change them for others. I'm simply an autistic person who ""did what was asked"" of autistic people by NT society and now needs to deal with the consequences of being simultaneously rejected by NT society as an autistic person and ""not being autistic enough"" as well as by parts of the autistic community for being ""low supports needs"" and even by many in the late dx community as ""too negative"" about the deficits of being autistic. No matter what I say or do, someone will be angry. Someone will place be in another box that isn't theirs. I want us to stop building boxes.

I want all autistic people to know about the experiences of others that aren't like their own. I want hyperlexic autistic folks to speak with those who aren't verbal. I want those who go to university to speak with those who don't. I want those who live independently to understand those who live in an institution. I want those of us who are utterly disabled by being autistic to speak to us who don't think that way. I want those who experience pure autistic joy to sit and understand those on the other end. Because we DO all have a common thread. Something which unites us, which is why we all ARE autistic. I want us to TRY to not internalize what everyone tells us what we are and what we should be. THAT is why I do this work. Because I have seen ""both ends of the spectrum”. Precisely because I have friends and family who are both ""autistic superheroes"" who advocate for themselves and others who cannot even begin to know what the concept of self-advocacy is. We are all different, but we are all in the same boat too.

The more we are divided the more our rights and lives will be violated by those who wish to change us or remove us from society and the world. This isn't hyperbole, but something we all know is happening on a daily basis. That isn't to say that all allistic people want us dead or want to hurt us. Clearly not. But the system in which we live isn't supporting us and there are absolutely plenty of organizations and individuals who are ACTIVELY seeking to harm us. The majority are indifferent. Yes, I know that I will receive flack for this. I know I will be called an ableist (for different reasons), an idiot, someone who doesn't know how to communicate ""properly"", a charlatan, someone who ""doesn't get it"", privileged, and someone who hurts autistic people for profit. I'm used to it. I'm invalidated on a daily, invalidated by thousands on a monthly basis. AND SO ARE ALL OF YOU. I simply get it publicly for all to see. But we are all invalidated daily and it hurts. I want that to change and that's why I do what I do.

And yes, I am privileged. In that I am a white-passing MENA cis male holding a formal dx. I have it as good as almost anyone in the autistic community in terms of safety and privilege. I use that platform to speak up for those who don't have that same privilege. And yes, I am also victimized for being autistic. For being a non Christian in a Christian society. For speaking or walking and acting differently. Treated like a second-class citizen because I am multi-disabled. Like all things, there is nuance. The biggest nuance, to me, in terms of everything here, is that being autistic is complicated. There is no absolute. That can be hard for many of us who think in binary absolutes. I'm like that myself naturally, but I know that the world is more complicated. Humans are complicated.

Autistic people are all humans. We aren't one-size fits all and we all have different, yet shared struggles. This is amplified for those of us who aren't white cis males and have other disabilities and/or impairments. Anyway, I recognize that this may seem like rambling now and someone will get angry for my lack of being clear. So I will leave it to those who want to discuss these topics, and the nuance of being autistic in different ways while sharing a common thread to reply as they see fit.

And for the various naysayers - I am formally dx as Level 2, but recognize self DX as more than legitimate due to too many reasons to be listed here. I have both lived independently AND with others for support. I have studied in university and worked in a F/T high pressure job AND been unemployed and on benefits. I have been institutionalized and hospitalized in my life AND been a mentor to those who are in institutions & hospitals. I know how to travel by myself but also need to take weeks to mentally prepare and even then, often cannot handle it. I know what it's like to have a meltdown in public and be harmed by the police for it. I know what it's like to be picked on, shamed, blamed, and harmed. I am proud and happy to be autistic but also know the great challenges and pain that come along with it. I live in the grey spaces and nuance. It's there that we can relate to each other, even if we seem differently from afar. I know what it's like to be an autistic person who has both been removed from society & as one who has built an independent life. I see both ends and have lived it. That's why I do the advocacy work that I do.",44,178,178,0.96,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13lqwgn')>,,/r/AutisticPride/comments/13lqwgn/all_autistic_people_should_speak_to_each_other/,,,False

2331,yes,AutismTranslated,2023-04-26 09:43:42,theautisticcoach,"Using Words Like ""Manipulative"" and ""Narcissistic"" When Speaking With Other Autistic People","When we people call other autistic people things like “devious”, “manipulative”, “shady”, “disingenuous”, “too loud”, “self centered”, “narcissistic” and other words used to put us down, when simply disagreeing with someone's POV, they are parroting the TYPICAL NT SLURS that are used against autistic people. Using terms like this is part of our internalized ableism. That isn't to say that we cannot be manipulative or any of those things, but it is not essential to our being autistic. When these words are typically used in the community it's because we don't like someone. 

While all autistic people will not be friends, the theory of Double Empathy posits that we should at least be able to communicate on the same level. I think it goes deeper than this. It’s about understanding the POV, not that we always understand or agree with the RATIONALE. I can vehemently disagree with a fellow autistic person, but understand why they believe something, even if I don’t accept that belief. We can extend grace to our fellow autistic brains. 

That doesn’t mean that it’s OK to use slurs like I used above. These are the words of our literal oppression. These are the words that have been used to inflict trauma on us; to gaslight us for decades. If you use these terms when speaking about other autistic people, take a pause. Remember Double Empathy. Remember that their brain is similar to yours and processes things similarly, even if different on this topic. When both sides assume good faith there can be positive outcomes, even if not agreement. When we go in with bad faith, using the terms above, all shuts down. You are putting your fellow autistic person into the same traumatic place that NTs have been putting them for years. 

Your mask and want of fitting in has become so neurotypicalized that you are becoming the very thing you hate in that moment. Pause. PAUSE. Is the person you’re debating with truly “evil”? Or do they simply have a thought process that arrived somewhere else? Maybe you can walk them thru it. Calmy. Politely. Bring them to your POV. Rarely will they be TRULY evil, though of course it is possible. Be patient. Extend grace to one another.

While all NTs aren't actively seeking to oppress autistic people, many, in fact, do. When we advocate for ourselves to these individuals we will get slapped down. Insulted. Cursed at. Put down. Perhaps even violently. 

This can be discouraging. More than discouraging, it IS dysregulating. It costs us spoons. It makes us afraid to do it again. A step back. I know the feeling of having my self-advocacy turned against me by NTs. So do you. We are called ""selfish"", ""not a team player"", and even told that ""we play the victim"". 

People in authority and with privilege don't like to be questioned or pushed by who they see as their inferior. They have their own issues of feeling inadequate. That doesn't mean we have to accept it, but it's important to know that the ""failure"" of our advocacy doesn't sit with us. It isn't because we ""didn't try hard enough"". It's because NTs in power (over us or over society) don't want to yield to us.

This has been shown in a study by H Kupferstein (2018) and is backed up by the testimonies of tens of thousands of victims of ABA. Further studies by Gorycki, Ruppel, and Zane (2021) have shown that ABA is not an effective ""therapy"" whatsoever.

The great irony, of course, being that ABA is the only available ""support"" given in many countries. The Autism Industrial Complex is real. The entire industry (and it is an industry) exists only to use autistic bodies to extract profit for a select few.

My new Finding Your #ActuallyAutistic Self groups are starting up this month and I'm really excited to share them with you. Every week, 6 of us will be getting together to share, learn & grow by exploring the Autistic Self in a collaborative, affirming & relaxed environment.

Each week we will be discussing important and pressing topics to the lives of all autistic people, including getting in touch with your inner self, self-advocacy, how to identify and prevent meltdowns, shutdowns & burnouts, tools for self-regulation & more.

We will be looking at how executive function plays a role in our wellbeing, how special interests and our values influence our health and happiness, and how to battle ableism in society and within ourselves. All groups are totally accessible to all autistic folks.

2418,yes,AmItheAsshole,2023-05-13 02:11:24,aairo1228,AITA for parking in a handicap spot?,"I can explain.

So I was driving to the grocery store with my mom in her car. She had surgery recently and was wheelchair bound so she got a temporary handicap tag.

I pulled around looking for a close parking spot, but at first I couldn't find one so I put my blinkers on and helped her into her wheelchair before I went around looking for a parking spot again. She went in and waited at the front for me so I could get the cart and help her with her shopping.

I went around to look for a spot that was relatively close when I spotted a handicap spot that had just opened up. I went ahead and pulled in, and after I locked up and started walking to go inside, a car pulled up next to me and began SCREAMING at the top of her lungs that she needed the spot because she was handicapped, and that I was fraudulently using the spot.

I'm autistic with cPTSD, and shut down the *second* someone starts to shout. So, I go back to the car, and pull out while she's yelling her head off, then park in the waaaaaaay back hoping that she would park and be in before I had a chance to meet with her again. And I figured that I'd just pull the car around when we were done and do the blinker thing again. Not a big deal, right? Wrong!

But unfortunately, by the time I got up to the store door, she was there, screaming her head off at me again. I was mortified. I walked in, still not saying anything and feeling faint bc I'm about to have a panic attack. It took me a second to find my mom with this bitch behind me, screaming 'you don't get to part in a disabled spot?! Who do you think you are?! Son of a b*h! Do you know the distress you caused me?!' I genuinely thought she was gonna try to beat me with her cane.

Of course I don't turn around to tell her I'm about to have a full on melt down bc she doesn't know the distress she's causing me because now I can't even remember that language is part of my capabilities. But regardless.

I find my mom looking at greeting cards and walk up to her as this person is still screaming at me, and take her hand to tell her I'm starting to panic. My mom is a Karen all of her own, and we do NOT have a good relationship bc of how entitled  and narcissistic she is, but this was the one time she actually defended me. And it was a short fight, where my mom rolled up to this woman and started screaming at her until she walked away.

So yeah, TD;DR parked in parking spot bc mom was handicap after I dropped her off.

2420,yes,Paranormal,2023-05-07 06:56:51,aairo1228,Is this paranormal or am I going crazy,"Alright. First post... No pressure.

So, my wife's father recently passed away. It was sudden, and very traumatic for us all... We've been trying to clean out the house and get everything situated, but it's been hard. So truth be told, we've been neglecting it.

But, when we do come back to check the mail or to just sit and watch TV, it always feels welcoming and calm. There's a nice air about it.

So, ""paranormal"" stuff. I've believed in the paranormal for a while, have gone on investigations, etc. And I notice that about 90% of the places I've been have explanations. 

I have no explanations for this stuff.

There's classic stuff, cool air, weird emfs. But, all that could be explained with a draft and wiring. 

The weirdness is when we came over for sister in laws birthday. They were drinking (I'm so er bc lucky me was born with an allergy to most alcohols) and we decided to try our spirit box. We didn't get much on them, but, when we went upstairs, we were talking about redecorating the nursery because they were off on a drunken tangent. Then the door handle fully turned and clicked open the door.

I screamed like a tiny child, and the girls all yelled and slammed the door back shut. But, like something straight up out of the movies, it wouldn't shut. Not for a few long seconds before whatever was holding it disappeared and the girls fell onto the damn door.

We tried to recreate it right after we all laughed at being so scared over something that was probably nothing. Maybe the draft blew it open? Nope, no draft and it was latched good. It's a heavy, old door. Was there a piece of broken wood from the frame to blame for it staying open? Couldn't find anything. This house was build a hundred years ago, and it's all original (except the god awful wallpaper).

After setting up a security system, because we're out a few days at a time, we noticed what looks like orbs around. Though, it's hard to tell bc of the dust.

We stayed away for a while after that, because nothing else happened. Until tonight.

The house got broken into because it's been vacant, not that there's anything valuable in it unless you want a heavy 1970s tv. But it was still a violation of our space. We got here and have been chilling in the livingroom, watching TV on our phones and we heard a weird noise. 

The second hand on the clock on the wall, an analog clock powered by a double a battery, started spinning. Just the second hand. Then there was a shadow that we've been trying to convince ourselves was a car headlight.

And I'm wracking my brain as to what caused the second hand to freak out, when I heard the locked back door click open. It's locked by a latch lock, with the latch on my side. I went over and saw the basement light on. There's a workshop down there and a washer and dryer unit, but not much else. I go down like the white guy in a horror movie, and look around. Nothing. No where for anyone to hide. So I casually go back up, lock it, and begin writing a reddit post

2422,yes,stories,2022-12-12 08:33:56,aairo1228,To the woman at the gas station...,"I was working as a delivery driver. I stopped for some water at the gas station when I saw a girl and her boyfriend talking to each other on their bikes. It was like one am and she was crying. I didn't think much of it until I came out and they were sitting on the curb while he was holding her head.

I went over because I was trained in first aid, and thought I might be able to help. When I got there, this girl told me she got hit by a car, and hit her head really bad, but she didn't want to go to the hospital because they were homeless and were afraid they would get turned away. I had her get up and walk to see how disoriented she was, with her boyfriend holding her up by her other arm when a woman came out and started yelling at me, ""you're not taking her to your car!""

Now, I'm a pretty big dude, and I was masked (bc covid) so I get it. I explained to her what happened, and the woman said she saw it, and that she was an rn. I was super relieved that she was there because the girl was way too disoriented and her hand was broken, which she hadn't even realized until I pointed it out. 

The nurse thought it was a fracture on the bone around her temple and eye socket, but she for sure had a concussion. I took the nurse a bit away from them and told her that I'm going to call the ambulance when I get back to work. She nodded and thanked me, and then I said my good byes to the girl and her boyfriend. I don't know what happened after that, but I did see ambulances when I drove by again.

I want to say to that woman that I'm really grateful that she stepped in. Because when I was a young woman, I'm FTM, I was lured into a car and raped. I wish someone was there for me, but my boyfriend at the time didn't even believe me even after I came home from the er. He thought I cheated on him and made it up. 

So, I don't know if she'll ever see this, but Mrs. Nurse, thank you for looking out for her. You can't tell a person's past by their appearance, and even though I wasn't going to hurt her, you couldn't have known that. In essence, you saved her life.

I hope you're all doing well, and to the girl, I hope you were able to get to your mom's house like you said you were going.",3,4,4,0.84,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='zjsom6')>,,/r/stories/comments/zjsom6/to_the_woman_at_the_gas_station/,,,False

Hey everyone, I'm 27, in college, and I have major depressive disorder, PTSD, and anxiety disorder. 5 years ago, I was able to hold a job, I was in college, and I had stability. I decided to quit work, and my wife and I went to school together. 
I'm still in school, after failing a few classes and being unable to keep up with the course work, I tried to calm the school thing down and go part time and work part time. Well, 5 jobs this year and I haven't managed to keep a hold of one for over a month. I have panic attacks that are so bad that I faint or throw up. And it's just over leaving the house. I've tried to relax, tried to find outlets with friends and I can't even manage that these days. My wife is super supportive, and kind. She understands, but I feel like I'm letting her down by failing so much at what I set out to do. I'm an artist, and haven't even sat down to paint or draw in months. 
This decline has happened over the course of a year, I'm feeling worse and worse about myself, I'm terrified I'm going to lose financial aid, and that we'll be homeless. I feel so hopeless and worthless.
I don't have insurance, and there's no counselor or therapist that's free out here that's equipped to handle someone like me, I've tried the only free resource out here. 
I genuinely don't know what started this decline in my mental state. Idk if it's just childhood trauma coming to a head, if that's the case why it started now, or how to even get out of it. I need advice and resources to resolve this...

>  
\*Interoception means sensing internal signals from your body, like when you are hungry, when your heart is beating fast, or when you need the toilet.    


I am of course autistic, have ADHD and certain other issues like c-PTSD, Clinical Depression and anxiety disorder on top of that. 

I have large periods of hyperfocus and time blindness so it is not abnormal for me to sit 12 hours uninterrupted coding in my own little bubble without eating, drinking, going to the toilet or doing anything other than shift around on my chair while I work. 

When I am in those zones I can't hear my alarms or anything like that either so, my long-distance partner used to remind me daily but has been drowning in their work and just hasn't even had the chance to message me in the right time slots to check in an remind me, or persistently ring my phone and desktop messengers until it comes through that someone is trying to reach me. 

Does anyone have experience with the issues like:

* Not noticing you need to pee until you're almost wetting yourself?
* Not noticing your hungry before you start to crash from lack of nutrition?
* Not noticing you've not drank anything all day until you just realize your mouth is sandpaper?
* Not noticing you're tired until you start falling asleep where you stand?

2454,yes,AutisticAdults,2022-11-26 10:13:46,HyperAutisticDude,The right environment makes all the difference,"Finding a job and a place to belong often seemed to feel like a lost battle to me. At home, at school and at all my previous jobs I'd be bullied, excluded and blamed for being different. 

Bad intensions such as arrogance, malice, and such prescribed to my behaviours my desire to help, share knowledge and such seen as trying to be a show off and such. 

I spend 6 - 7 years working call enter after high school and would optimize our scripts and knowledge items, which they would use because they were better but then also say I was a know it all and arrogant and passive aggressive. 

I had to break away from my family and after call centre I ended up in a job training course through our unemployment program and ended in a Java bootcamp. It was a lot of fun, and people suddenly loved my knowledge hoarding and sharing and how I worked.

It became clearer and clearer that my sensory and social issues were an issue on the work floor.  So when I was looking for a job and was asked about my weaknesses I was honest about it, I am one of the people on the spectrum who just can’t lie, so many interviews ended just because I indicated that I was Autistic and on the waitlist for the full diagnosis. I however didn’t have one yet so companies that recruited in that direction weren’t an option either.

So many doors were closed in my face on the first interview, more afterwards when they said it was no problem only for them to see my honesty as a liability. Until I got approached by my current employer, they didn’t have room for me at the time, but they could see how passionate and eager to learn I was. They kept me in mind and when they had room for me, they gave me the chance to prove I was a good fit, and I was hired. 

They told me “I don’t care about a diagnosis, tell me what you need and we’ll see what we can do.”   

I have proven myself a hard worker, and a team player. I might look weird to people with my sunglasses on all the time, wearing noise cancelling gear as I dig in on the technical riddle in front of me. I got to do this because they believed in me, and because they didn’t stumble back on my honesty and focused on my passion and what I could bring to the table. 

I do my best, and instead of hiding and laying low, all my coworkers know, I tell new hires myself because I became the tech point for the entire team. In a year and a half I went from junior to technical lead. 

We recently got a review system where we give each other feedback, and I cried when I got my yearly this week because all the feedback was about how much they loved working with me, and appreciated what I brought to the table. 

I don't get forced to come to the office, though they ask me to try and come in once a month so the coworkers can hang out with me without needing to schedule in a Teams call. When there are surprise events my boss notifies me in advance so I don't get thrown off and can prepare for them. 

It took me a year to find this job after having been told that I would have a job in no time because of how skilled I was by the school, but I am glad I was open and honest about my situation because I found an office where I am not only able to make my pay check, but where I get to feel like I belong.

2458,yes,IncelExit,2022-04-28 08:57:59,HyperAutisticDude,My journey from incel to be engaged,"I wanted to share my story, but I want to preface this with a TW, my story contains references to r\*pe and murder, nothing explicit, just it's part of it.

&#x200B;

I am an autistic man, the type that was overly honest, didn't understand personal boundaries, and never seemed to be able to form any lasting friendship with women, or a lot of people in general honestly.

I personally am not one of the people with a high sex drive, but I have a high need for intimacy and companionship. I was bitter, oh so very bitter, ""Women are all so two face, cold, and don't appreciate a nice honest guy"".

It's a sentiment I know a lot of incel's start with. I was so frustrated, and I felt like my being small (5'3), autistic, ""nice"" was just repelling women.

I had this mindset for a very long time, never fell into the punishing women for it mindset, mostly because it was before I went to look at places like forum's and reddit, since I felt the same would happen there.

I made a friend during that period though, online, through Deviantart, wasn't told their gender, didn't care really, didn't think I'd stand a chance if they turned out to be a woman anyway. So we wrote together, talked about our lives together. Since I didn't know what gender they were, I treated them like a person.

Years of this friendship passed, I learned my friend was a woman, but they were so cemented as the person and friend I had that I didn't suddenly flip a switch and start treating them differently, just saw them as an exception to the rule of how women were.

I had made a male friend in real life during that time to, during my last years of high school, a friend with a little sister, I saw her as my own little sister due to how close we all got, even fought with her like a sibling. Then in feb 2017 she met an Incel to trade figurines. She went missing and she was found in his garden, he'd lured her in with her hobby to force her to give him what he felt he was owed, for what he felt the world owed him, a ""foid"" to control and breed with. When she resisted, he'd killed her so violently he injured his own hand. (If you want proof of the case being real Pokemon Murder Antwerp Belgium)

He was my exact age, similar story, and just a slightly more extreme view than I had, and he completely destroyed my view on life. The more came to light the more I realized how close to that mind set I was, if I had been more sexually targeted...I shudder to think that I might have reasoned that it was my right to have that need met. I examined my black and white notions on people, especially women, and really looked at how I presented and acted.

During that time my DeviantArt friend was there for me, which helped, but it was hard, and it took a lot of therapy and re-evaluating myself. I realized that yes I think differently, yes I see the world differently and I don't emote naturally so I trigger the uncanny valley effect in people a lot. But I also realized I was approaching people in real life with a lot of expectation to be rejected and shunned, which turned it into a self fulfilling prophecy that furthered my frustration and what had been a growing simmering rage at how unfair it all was.

My two friends helped me, my therapist helped me, and at the end of my journey, my very first friend, my deviant art friend, became more than that, she became my amazing long distance girlfriend, who I get to call with and talk to almost daily, and soon we're moving in together after I popped the question and she said yes.

A person I spend 12 years of my life getting to know, without ever having the expectation for it to become anything more than an internet friend, a person I never put in a box.

A woman I treated as a person, who I allowed to know me, not a persona to try and fit in and get the girl so I can finally have some one to meet my needs to cuddle and be affectionate.  Neither of us is perfect, but we approached each other as people, I saw her as a person first and a woman second, I had no expectations, and that's where I found it.

I like to think I'd have come to this journey naturally with age if it had never happened, but end of the day, I might have gotten sucked into an echo chamber and gotten deeper and deeper into that black and white view that we can so easily get sucked into.

I am sharing my story, because it's a victory through a tragedy, but also, let that guy be a warning, of the path the mindset we fall in can lead to, attacking people because we want them, or mass killing people because we're mad at the world...

It's easier said then done to change that mindset, and kind of funnily what's been helping for me is just stopping to put genders on people, everyone is a they to me now until they specifically tell me otherwise, and by the time they do, my behavior has already been established.

The problem is - or the problems are - my psychiatrist doesn't want to refer me to anyone who can diagnose autism since I already have the BPD diagnosis.

I was diagnosed shortly after my 18th birthday while I was in an abusive relationship. They never did tests, the psychologist just told me the nurses ""kept an eye on me"" and that's how they diagnosed me with BPD. Back then I had many problems because of that abusive relationship - i often self harmed,  had an eating disorder and my abuser forced me to drink lots of alcohol so I also had a problem with that. Now that I'm single and healing from that trauma I'm not sure if that was the right thing to do to diagnose me with BPD while i was still being abused. Especially without any tests. Someone has gone through the test for BPD a few weeks ago and I don't meet enough criterias to be diagnosed with BPD.

This is all very confusing to me. I sometimes see tiktoks from people with BPD and I rarely relate to them.

When Logan was in the hospital and recuperating, Marcia tried to push all the children away, including Shiv. Shiv helped to push Marcia aside by supporting Logan getting close to Rhea.

2. When Nate criticises her about brokering a deal between Logan and Gil, she reveals the truth to Tom, and Tom humiliates Nate.

3. When Rhea betrayed Shiv, Shiv made sure to influence Logan so that Rhea was picked for CEO while Waystar was in the line of fire of the DOJ.

4. When Gil criticises her, she sides with Logan. She also goes on to supports her family in witness tampering and humiliating Gil in court.

5. When Kendall plays Nirvana over her speech, she releases a reputation-shattering public letter. 

6. When Roman was getting too close to Logan, in Shiv’s opinion, she influenced Logan to think of Roman as incompetent because of the pictures he sent to Gerri.

7. Tom betrayed her in the last episode of the 3rd season and she was divorcing Tom before Logan died.

Of course, she got back together with Tom, and her mom also betrayed her, and we have yet to see what Shiv will do to her.

How will all this work with Logan gone? I don’t know, as it seems like her main strategy is to use her sway over Logan against other people.

In my opinion, it doesn’t seem like she really plans any of this but she seems to be more of an opportunist. If someone has betrayed her, then, if she sees an opportunity to hurt or undermine them, she does it.

Her actions don’t completely shut the other person down, but they do deal some kind of significant blow. However, with her feeling sidelined by her brothers, the outcome of the election, her father’s death, the state of her marriage and her planning to have a child (so she might care even more about the state of the nation and how the Roy’s are perceived by the public), she might hit a bit harder this time.

Historically, she also doesn’t seem that interested in shoring up her own position when she does any of this. She’s looking to advance her position, sure, but I feel like she sometimes “goes for the kill” in way that feels compulsive and self-destructive which is similar to Logan. She wants to hurt the person who betrayed her, ideally more than they hurt her.

As a kid, I thought I was the weird one. I mean, of course I am, I have autism and ADHD, but I was only recently diagnosed as an adult, and also, these conditions are, at least partially, genetic, so they probably have some of these traits too. 

When I went to school, and interacted with other kids and adults, I realised that my family is weird too. I still have moments when I share certain things with friends, strangers, colleagues etc., and they do a double take. I hate those moments, but I also like them, because it makes me feel validated in the confusion, and sometimes the pain, resulting from the behaviour of my realtives. 

Eventually, I learnt to mask, not only my own behaviours, but the behaviours of my relatives. Like all other types of masking, it’s not super effective and also exhausting.

Throughout my life, I went from thinking the problems in my family are about psychology, then thinking it was about generations of trauma related to politics and economics, and finally, now, understanding it’s also about neurodiversity. Really, its all these things and probably much more.

It’s always felt like a Rubix Cube, but far more complicated. When it comes to Rubix Cubes, there are people who work on solutions that you can read and apply. Are psychologists these people for my family problems? I don’t know. I want a playbook and I want it yesterday.

I’ve never known how to feel or what to do. It feels like there are no “correct” feelings or actions. Or, that the “correct” feelings and actions are designed for “neurotypical” standards. I don’t mean that any one individual person is truly “neurotypical” but that systems in our society are designed based on certain assumptions about neurotypes and all kinds of other things, like privileging the wealthy, and “white”, and “able-bodied”.

I closed the door on all of this several years ago, in order to focus on the things I can actually control in my life, since those are challenging to manage already, but I’m thinking about all of this again as there is a special occasion coming up and I feel compelled to engage with it in a kind of superficial “well-wishing” kind of way.

I’m quite frustrated with a lack of easily accessible empirical evidence when it comes to career-related topics. 

For example, how accurate are different career assessments and what are the basic elements of career satisfaction?

I have found this article:
https://80000hours.org/career-guide/job-satisfaction/

But it’s only one article, it’s rather old, it’s written from a privileged perspective and tied to the philosophy of effective altruism. It’s not bad but I would like more articles like this one that might provide a wider range of perspectives.

I have also looked at self-report surveys of people in certain professions. However, these feel inadequate as well. For example, not everyone will be suited to being a nurse because interacting with people all day in a high-stress environment with lots of sensory stimulation might not be the best fit for them.

In addition, a lot of the research on autism, ADHD and other neurodiversity related to employment seems rather ableist and sexist etc.

Is anyone else also frustrated by this? I feel like most of the information I find is essentially outdated jibber jabber full of assumptions and overgeneralisations. Am I just not looking in the right place?

Does anyone know of a specific organisation or professional that focuses on providing empirical evidence related to careers to the general public?

2490,yes,TheTryGuys,2022-10-09 18:06:09,NoPiano6624,Everything wrong with the SNL sketch (a far too long comprehensive breakdown),"My first instinctual response to pain is intellectualising. Welcome to the inside of my brain. It’s wordy in here.

Serious issues first:

1. Not protecting possible victims: In the “what happened” video Eugene, Zach and Keith never confirmed who the employee was. This was for good reason as this employee would be subjected to harassment and public shaming. And the employee who people think it might be has, in fact, been subjected to this. We cannot ignore that this person is an Asian American woman and this brings into play the history of abuse in the USA and elsewhere towards Asian women. In the SNL skit, they refer to the employee as “one of the Food Babies”. There are two Food Babies. Both have Asian heritage. People have already been confusing one for the other, a common problem that results from systemic racism. By saying “Food Babies” they are not only directing public shame towards the suspected person who is already vulnerable because of their gender and race, but they are also directing public shame towards an innocent victim who is also vulnerable because of their gender and race. This, to me, is possibly the worst thing that is actually wrong with the skit.
2. Invalidating victims of workplace sexual harassment, especially those oppressed by gender and race: This is a case of possible workplace sexual harassment. Firstly, they mock the “power dynamics” involved and even mock saying “it’s racist”. I don’t see how this is excusable, even in comedy or something theoretical. It’s not simply about the specifics of this situation as much as it is about how cases of workplace sexual harassment are handled both in private between employer and employee and in public, between colleagues and in the media. How does anyone expect victims to come forward if this is how these cases are treated? They are mocking a victim’s descriptions of the forces in play that actively abuse them and keep them oppressed. Secondly, Ned, the boss, has claimed that it was “consensual” in his official statement and SNL repeats this narrative. However, we do not have the employee’s statement saying that this was indeed consensual. Would we have the same narrative for workplace theft as we do for workplace sexual harassment? Imagine a different scenario, imagine if your boss was driving your car for a year, and I asked them whether you agreed to have them drive your car for a year, and the boss said “yes, they consented.” I would wonder whether you felt safe to say no to your boss and importantly l would wait to hear from you whether it is actually true that you consented to this and that you are indeed happy and benefiting from this transaction, before I categorised this as consensual. We can also probably agree that it is an unusual scenario, that the boss might be abusing their power, that some professional boundaries are crossed by the boss and that you should maybe be trying to get out of this job to find something more healthy.
3. Perpetuating the tired old story that possible workplace sexual harassment “isn’t serious news”: This goes back to old narratives around sexual harassment, that it’s a “private sphere” thing and not serious business, like politics, which is seen to be a “public sphere” thing. Basically, sexual harassment is not “public news” but a “private matter”. It’s common and even expected. Anyone who calls this narrative out publicly, like Eugene, Zach and Keith, are publicly shamed and mocked.
4. Using an actor who, because of their identity, is statistically likely to be a victim, to play the role of casting doubt on whether events should “count” as workplace sexual harassment and “serious news”: The actor who plays the role of “the serious reporter” who wants to get “back to the serious actual news of politics” is played by a Black woman actor. The actor who plays a fan of the Try Guys and is defending their decision to take real action against possible workplace sexual harassment is a white man. How different would this skit be if the person being dismissed and talked over, because they were stating that an Asian American woman was possibly sexually harassed by their white and married boss, was a Black woman actor? I think it would feel a little too much like real life. Women, and especially women who also experience racial oppression and other kinds of oppression, for example, disabilities, are more likely to experience workplace sexual harassment. By making these casting choices they are actively obscuring the very “power dynamics” and “racism” that they are also mocking. Unacceptable.
5. Portraying events inaccurately or partially: In the sketch, they say something along the lines of “kissing an employee”. Even Ned’s statement implies that his actions involved more than this. I’m not saying this is what actually happened. We cannot know that, and it’s for the law to decide what happened. However, I don’t know how or why SNL would actively choose to portray his actions as “kissing an employee”. This seems minimising. Did they not research it properly? Did they actively minimise this to make it seem like it “wasn’t that big a deal”? In that case, it sounds very “Calm down, Sweetie, it wasn’t that big a deal,” which is just terrible. I don’t know which is the case, but either doesn’t show the skit in a good light. They make it sound like Ned “didn’t tell his friends” about something he did in his personal life and now they are “overreacting.” Those friends were his business partners who all took a risk together with Ned to found a startup. That startup was at least ¼ based on Ned being a “wife guy”, a persona he chose, when he could have been a “science guy” or “business guy” or anything else. This choice meant that he involved his wife and children in his public image and business. His wife worked at the company. He acted against his own personal brand and the brand of his company putting the jobs and careers of his wife, investors, business partners and staff in jeopardy. He could also have had an extramarital affair with anyone outside the company, this would then not have been workplace sexual harassment, but even so, he would still have been damaging a brand that he built together with his wife and business partners. It’s also important to note that Ned’s brand is inextricably tied up in the brand products, for example, fans might not watch old videos because Ned is in these videos. Therefore Ned’s actions retroactively damage existing products the Try Guys have spent eight years creating. In addition, all this comes at a time when the business was just reaching a new level of success by breaking into mainstream television with the Food Network show. I believe some of them, Zach for example, does have ambitions of working in mainstream television. How must this impact his career? Suffice to say, the other founders are validated in being upset for personal reasons, yes, but they are possibly even more validated in being upset for professional reasons.
6. Ignoring the possibility of professional misconduct and invalidating the appropriate reactions of business partners: We cannot know the official ins and outs of this situation but we know a little about how the company was structured. I believe they have said before that Ned managed many business processes including HR processes and company funds. If this is true, he could have been using these company processes to carry out non company activities for personal gain which might include sexual harassment. It might not be true. We cannot know. But the other owners of the company as well as their investors and staff are fully within their right to suspect this and be incredibly angry, worried and generally upset about it. It puts their current investments, current jobs and future careers in jeopardy.
7. Shaming men in power for acting appropriately when faced with the reality of sexual harassment by one of their business partners and friends: There are so many cases of men in power, especially straight white cis-gendered men in power, protecting their friends who are straight white cis-gendered men in power. In this case, the Try Guys have done the opposite. I’m not saying they should be praised and I don’t think they expect that. I’m saying that what they did should be the absolute bare minimum. Yet it is not. They are publicly mocked, shamed and treated as if they are overreacting. The SNL skit takes us in the opposite direction of where we should be going with these issues.
8. Shaming those who identify as men for displaying emotions: One of the reasons I like the Try Guys, and why I believe many fans like them, is because while they all identify as men, they actually express a wide range of emotions, not just anger, but sadness, joy, fear, disgust and everything in between. They’re not afraid of showing love for their friends, family, pets and communities. They’re not afraid of being categorised because of the silly things that bring them joy. They’re not afraid of being contradictory and of having irrational likes and dislikes. It makes me unbelievably sad that they would be “made fun of” for this. It’s horrible. Keith has spoken about how he had anxiety when buying groceries. Zach has a chronic disease spoken about how it has impacted him physically! How cruel can you be! How do we expect men to be honest about their emotions if this is how they are treated when they are being authentic? It’s terrible for men’s mental health and it enforces patriarchal values that hurt, not only men, but everyone.
9. Making the only gay and Asian member of the Try Guys seem violent: Fans know and absolutely adore Eugene for his nihilistic and unhinged humour. It’s something so-called “Millennials” and “Gen Zs” relate to. (We love you, please never change, Eugene.) But now that humour is being misinterpreted to make him seem violent and it is not lost on me, or, I think, any other Try Guys fan, that he is the only gay and Asian member of the Try Guys. This ties into a long history of deeply damaging tropes about gay and Asian men designed to keep people with these identities abused, oppressed and locked out of the power needed to change this situation. It’s absolutely inexcusable for them to have used this in their skit.
10. Encouraging a lack of gratitude for those who work “behind the scenes” in the video production industry: The skit seems to make fun of the Try Guys for thanking their editors for all the hard work they do. The Try Guys are a startup, albeit one with Buzzfeed support, and not working within a very large and established operation like SNL does, so, of course, the Try Guys editors will be struggling more and they, the founders, will be more grateful and thankful to their editors because they’ve done that work themselves. This shouldn’t be shamed, but be the bare minimum in the video production industry. Let’s respect and be grateful to everyone involved in delivering great content.

Some other silly (but also maybe kind of serious) issues:

1. The “food trying” comments at the end are not only racist but inaccurate: The food trying comments were both about “Asian” foods, “Cambodian” and “Malaysian.” Was that intentionally or accidentally a racist joke? Either way, it’s a bad look. Also, in the skit, Eugene and Zach were the ones who would theoretically try these foods. Keith is the only one not trying food! Like what? If they did their research they would know that it is Keith who definitely would be trying new foods surely. The others would too but like it’s not their “thing” like they could at least make Eugene rank some alcohol or play with puppies or something and have Zach do a weird candid competition. For some reason, this is the odd detail that makes me feel irrationally angry. I think this is because it feels like it shows just how little thought or care must have gone into it.
2. Ruining the Try Guys’ “first” SNL “appearance”: Some Try Guys admire some SNL writers and performers. I know from the TryPod episode “people we’re jealous of” that Keith and Zach admire some SNL writers and performers. I do too. It’s very sad to me that their “first appearance” on SNL is this real life nightmare of a skit. Should I blame Ned? The SNL writers or management? I don’t know. I just feel sad.
3. Ruining the “unique look” of their beautiful new office 😭: I remember watching the Architectural Digest video and seeing how much love and effort they put into designing their new office and how they wanted a “unique look” for their videos. Ariel was involved in this and did such incredible work. It hurt me so so much to see it shown in such a hurtful way in the SNL skit.
4. Implying that the Try Guys aren’t political: Throughout the skit the actor playing the “serious reporter” wants to get back to talking about politics. If they did any research at all they would realise that the Try Guys are very political. Think of Eugene’s latest Texas video. Think of everything Eugene has done for LGBTQIA+ rights. Think of Becky wearing a “protect trans kids” shirt. Think of Zach interviewing people with disabilities and discussing how the US government and CDC treated them during COVID. Think of Keith supporting Planned Parenthood in the nut challenge video.
5. Saying “What’s a Try Guy?” and mocking the Try Guys for “bravely” making content makes SNL look out-of-date: It might have been funny for an actor playing someone who is currently a child or a teenager to ask “What’s a Try Guy?” since it’s likely that most people who are fans of the Try Guys might be in their mid twenties or thirties right now, but when it comes from actors who are playing Millennials or Baby Boomers, it makes SNL seem out-of-date. In addition, listing the silly content they make and mocking them for making it “bravely” also makes SNL seem out-of-date. This is simply what people find entertaining. It provides audiences with comfort and develops a loyal and supportive fan base. This made me wonder whether SNL is maybe just making fun of YouTubers, TikTokers and other internet personalities. I know there is tension between more traditional media and internet personalities and I believe “Youtuber” “TikToker” and “influencer” are kind of dirty words if you are trying to make it in mainstream media. But I also know more people play video games and use TikTok than watch television or go to the movies these days, so really, video games and TikTok are, at least statistically, the mainstream, and maybe television shows like SNL feel threatened by this so they feel validated in attacking internet personalities whether intentionally or maybe even through some kind of unconscious jealousy. (Keith, cue the Olivia Rodrigo.)
6. Offending the fashion police 👠: This is just me being spicy but the person playing Eugene and whoever styled them did a complete disservice to Eugene’s beautiful outfit.

What did I miss? Anything else you would add?

I doubt anyone from SNL will read this, but we do know members of the Try Team sometimes browse this subreddit so maybe this thread might bring them some solace.

This skit has really made me feel like the world is such a horrible and cruel place.

2498,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-05-24 03:59:32,Naima92231,"At 61, It Occurs to Me That I'm Probably On the Autism Spectrum.","Last year I reconnected with a man I met in my late-20's (he's 6 years older), whom I considered a (very attractive) friend. I've know and cared about over the decades, but I got married, moved, had a wonderful son (now 24), eventually separated 
/divorced and move to another state with him, just to get away fro my ex.

But eventually I moved back (with my son) to the town I love the most, where my old friend still lives. He's 67, and I'm 61.

When we re-connected, he shortly thereafter went into the throes of some serious health complications. He'd lost a lot of weight and basically couldn't get up from his living-room floor to even feed himself, and was skeletal. So I brought him to my place for a while, where I could keep him fed, get him to doctors' appts., etc.

He continued to stay with me (or I'd stay at his place) after he got better. We were very affectionate with each other, but it was always platonic (not my idea--I'm seriously attracted to him, but I'm
not sure he understands why!).

Over time, he's become less physically affectionate (we've never even kissed). I don't mind (TOO much) not having sex, but we still sleep together sometimes and he's much less cuddly (not always, but more distant). I really miss that.

But he's warm and funny and talented and delightfully quirky. I love him as my best friend, but it's hard.

Anyway, a few months ago it dawned on me that he might be a very smart, high-functioning person on the spectrum. I slowly introduced the possibility to him--especially his sensory issues (I didn't question him much about sexuality), and a few other things. He seemed interested, and not insulted, by the possibility. We watched ""Rain Man,"", and now we're both always quoting from it.

I often tell him that, even when he makes no sense, he makes more sense to me than anyone. I trust him (not a common thing with me!), and I love him--I'm just not sure as WHAT, but that's pretty much okay. Well, sometimes it's been painful, but he knows that, and he's always kind and sweet (if a little hyper-critical sometimes). We tend to be there for each other, and he's obviously put effort into thinking about how I feel and adjusting how he responds.

I enjoy spending time with him more than anyone in years (aside from my soon, but that's different, of corse!).

I think that he and I tacitly agree that he's an ""aspie"" (I know that word's not used much any more), and, as I've learned more about it for his sake, I'm starting to believe (at 61!) that maybe I've been on the spectrum my whole life as well. For a long time I've thought that I have (and now get medicated for) ADD, but when I think back over my life and interactions I wonder..

I've taken a few online autism tests, with varying results, but today I took the AQ test and tested 33 out of 50! The questions can be so vague and difficult to answer, but I assume that's the way the tests are designed.

So, I guess, what next? I've never particularly trusted therapists. I just think back over my 6 decades, and how badly things often turned out at jobs, etc., and I guess I'd just like to understand. I know there's no magic pill for it, and I guess I'll always be this way.

But I've always carried a lot of shame and a lot of ""not quite fitting in,"" and I wonder if I can somehow reconcile all that, or if I can.

It hadn't been tended to before I moved in, except for the occasional clearing out of MANY weeds, in decades.

2501,yes,taoism,2023-03-05 18:57:18,Naima92231,Just a Bit of an Introduction...,"I'm so happy to have found this. I just wanted to say hello.
I was raised Catholic, and have studied a lot of spiritual traditions, but Taoism had me at, ""The names that can be named are not the eternal name"" (not my favorite translation, but it's what I've got on hand at the moment).

I have never in my life doubted the existence of what many (myself included sometimes--maybe for the sake of convenience!) call ""God"" or ""the Divine."" I feel as if I've felt it all around me as a loving presence since I was a small child. And yet ""religion"" never made much sense to me. In church as a child, I used to refuse to say the words ""I believe in one holy and apostolic church,"" etc. HOW, I thought (even then) could one group of people believe that only they had it ""right""?!

I still feel that presence all the time, although I'm much closer now to feeling it as a uniform force running through everything. And yet I can still feel it as ""personal"" and loving at the same time. And I've come to believe that that's okay too. To put it simply, I guess it's like feeling that there are no ""rules""--kind as if everything is in everything, and without boundaries, and one can just take it as it comes. That makes me happy. There is little that I fear other than the little games my human brain can play with me about good/bad, right/wrong, what others think etc. I feel--cared for. All the time--even when ""things"" feel hurtful or frightening (not that I don't still get hurt or frightened).

Wu Wei doesn't come easily to someone raised in such a dogmatic institutional religion, but I know at my core that it just...works, if I let it (that's the trick, of course!). Even with Taoism, I often feel that I should be doing/changing things--how I live, what I eat 🤯, etc.). But I know that sitting, preferably in silence or with music (which I have called ""God's language"" which I guess might be considered kind of contradictory!), and just allowing things to play out as they will is really all that's necessary for me. Easier said than done, of course!

So that's my (long) intro to y'all. I'm glad I'm here, and I'm glad you're here!",22,28,28,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='11j7oer')>,,/r/taoism/comments/11j7oer/just_a_bit_of_an_introduction/,,,False
2502,yes,hysterectomy,2023-03-05 17:11:37,Naima92231,"Extra-Emotional Post-Surgery, Even Post-Menopause?","Hi, all, and thanks again for all your kind support.

It's now been six days since my hysterectomy, and physically I've been doing amazingly well--very little pain, almost no trouble walking, sitting up, bending, etc., almost no blood--although I HAVE been sleeping a LOT, which is probably good right now.

In the past few days, though, my emotions are a mess. For one thing, I finally realized that I need to stop seeing an old friend with whom I've been pretty much platonically sleeping for about six months (he's really a sweetheart, and he's the one who spent the night in the hotel by the hospital with me the night before surgery just for support, but I've known for a while that he's not over another, much younger woman with whom I guess he was involved a few years ago when I wasn't living in this town, and I finally realized--with the help of a VERY easy-to-interpret dream that was probably the result of Oxy a few nights ago--that for the sake of my mental health I need to stop seeing, and I told him last night). (He's 67 and I'm 61--just kids! :) ) 

I cried for over an hour last night--I almost never do that. And, although my recovery has been going remarkably well and I'm super-relieved it's over with, the past few days have been an emotional roller-coaster. It MAY just be because of my friend, and I was also being pretty unusually emotional before surgery (to the point where my adult son told me he was worried about me). And of course the pain meds may affect me too (although I haven't taken more than one Percocet a day).

But I've been looking all over the place online to try to find out whether ovarian cysts (I had a BIG one, which is why I needed the total hysterectomy) and/or the surgery itself and removal of organs, can cause any kinds of hormonal issues in POSTMENOPAUSAL women. I'm thinking it's probably mostly been just stress and sadness because of the guy and and the surgery, but I don't like feeling like this, and it still worries my son.

I didn't even shower yesterday, and I HATE going a day without a shower!

2504,yes,hysterectomy,2023-02-28 22:49:20,Naima92231,"So Far, So Weirdly Great!","Well, the deed (full hysterectomy/large cyst removal) was done yesterday. I was expecting all kinds of terrible things, but so far it was the best experience with surgery I've ever had (I even sent my surgeon a thank-you message today!).

I was mostly concerned (as was the surgeon) because I've got a lot of adhesions from previous abdominal surgeries. The procedure was supposed to be robotic, but there was a good chance they'd have to open me up...again. But NO! Just a couple of little punctures in my belly--not pretty, but a hell of a lot better than another real scar. And the cyst appears to have been benign. :)

So far, my belly is sore, obviously, but I've had no serious gas problems, and I have zero throat pain from the tube. There's only been a little blood, but it's tapering off.

I was surprised that they gave me TEN Oxy's, which do help with sleep and pain. I'd never take more than one a day, at night (a dose of Tylenol during the day).

I posted last week that I was hoping to drive to my friend's family's place with him this weekend. I actually think I could have been just fine for it, but it was cancelled because my friend's brother-in-law was also hospitalized. So maybe in a few more weeks, which will be even better.

The only thing that's got me seriously pissed off right now is that when I got home I found out that there's been a water-main break that has left the entire square-mile city completely without water. I need a shower!!!

I'd be happy to answer anyone's questions--you've all been such a great source of support and info for me, and I know that a few of you have procedures coming up, so I'd like to pay it forward. :)",7,27,27,0.97,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='11emko8')>,,/r/hysterectomy/comments/11emko8/so_far_so_weirdly_great/,,,False
2505,yes,hysterectomy,2023-02-24 01:54:11,Naima92231,Surgery Moved From 3/13 to This Monday-I Could Use Some Help Preparing!,"Reading through people's posts here, especially about what to expect post-op, has been SO helpful to me--thank you. I just have some questions, given my personal situation. Any advice would be really greatly appreciated!

In mid-December, during a visit to the ER for some pain that wasn't terrible, but was getting worse, a CT scan found an almost 12 cm. cyst on one of my ovaries. How I never noticed, I have no idea, but lately I very much notice--it hurts more all the time, and I've been afraid to move because it might torse or burst.

I originally had a full hysterectomy scheduled for about 2 weeks from now, and I was getting nervous about waiting that long. But this morning the hospital called and said there'd been a cancellation, and that I could get the surgery done this Monday (4 days from now). I just thought, ""YES! Just get this stupid thing out of me!!""

But I thought I'd have more time to prepare. From what I've been reading, it sounds as if I should buy some Gas-X or something ahead of time, as well as some pads for any bleeding (I haven't had a period in years, and even when I was young I'd sometimes go for months, or even over a year, without them, so I'm more clueless than most women about this stuff). But I have a miraculous wonderful 24-year-old son, so I don't need any of the stuff that's coming out!

So, my first question would be about what, exactly, I should have on hand ahead of time. I don't have a lot of time to get stuff, and I don't want to send my son or anyone else out to get me that stuff after the surgery (ESPECIALLY my son!). I haven't bought ""hygiene products""--especially pads--in, well, a really long time. I don't even know what to look for.

And then there's the fact that an old friend with whom I sleep relatively platonically (cuddling mostly, which is awesome for me at this point--not that I'm not seriously attracted to him!) asked me a few days ago to go to his sister's house, which is about an hour and 1/2 drive from here, to meet his mother and celebrate her 97th (!) birthday, as well as those of his brother and sister. (My friend is doing me the huge favor of staying at a hotel near the hospital with me the night before the surgery--that means so much to me, because I'm afraid I'll be a nervous wreck Sunday night.) 

But the family visit is less than a week after my surgery. I spoke to the PA at my surgeon's office, and she sounded a little wary but said that if I take it easy, avoid speed-bumps in the road (in New Jersey?!!), and stop to walk every so often during the drive to avoid blood-clots or something, it could be possible. I REALLY  want to go, but I'd kind of like to avoid bleeding all over my friend's sister's house, etc.

So I wanted to ask people who've experienced this in real-life--am I crazy to think I can make that trip? And, again, what should I have on hand for when I get home, and when I make the trip, if I do?

I've had lots of abdominal surgeries, and the last one was laparoscopic, and I was walking just fine the next day. This is a bit more radical, but (assuming nothing goes wrong during surgery) I'm pretty healthy otherwise, and I'm hoping that I can have my hysterectomy and eat (the cake) too.

2506,yes,ovariancysts,2023-02-18 15:59:46,Naima92231,More Ovarian Cyst Questions,"Hi, all. I've posted about the newest addition to my body--a complex septated cyst that's a little over 11 cm.--here a few times. I'm 61. I'm scheduled for a full hysterectomy by a very good oncological surgeon on 3/13--three months after the thing was accidentally found on CT in the ER (I'd gone in because of some weird pain). Seems like a long time, and one thing I'm wondering is how fast these things can grow (it's already shoving my uterus out of place, apparently).

So I've had all the imaging, and an appt. with a highly regarded surgeon in a few weeks, but I've been feeling a little weird in the past week or so, and have more questions...

First, I've never had terrible pain from this--just twinges here and there and feeling a little bloated, especially at night.

But lately I'm feeling more pain more often, including short, sharp pains in the area that should be around my liver. Is that ""normal,"" or could it mean that the cyst is malignant and has spread to my liver, or vice versa? Both my CA-125 and HE Whatever (sorry--I can't remember the name at the moment) were normal, and the cyst, aside from being big and septated and probably epithelial, so far doesn't show any other telltale signs of malignancy.

Also, I've been trying to stay strong by exercising (mostly a little barre, light weights, and walking), but things do start to hurt and fell like they're ""jiggling around"" when I'm walking, so I wonder if I should stop. I'd just like to be in the best shape possible for the surgery/recovery, but I definitely don't want to twist or burst the cyst while trying!

Finally, have cysts caused serious fatigue in anyone? Last night I planned to go out to see a band, and I was excited. I ate a little pizza and had my evening cocktail around 5 (that usually has little-to-no effect), and suddenly I HAD to go to sleep. I figured I'd nap 20 minutes or so, but I wound up sleeping for almost 3 hours, and even after that I could barely stay awake to change into nightclothes and brush my teeth. I was SO disappointed, but also concerned... I'm not normally a bundle of energy, but that was extreme fatigue. But so far this morning I'm okay.

So if anyone has any insight into/experience with any of the above, I'd love to hear from you.

And of course I'm happy to try to answer others' questions, when I can.

Yesterday I received the results of a pelvic MRI of a large (about the size of a medium potato 😱) cyst on my ovary. It was originally found almost by accident on a CT scan, followed by an ultrasound, and, finally the MRI. (I'm 61, btw.)

I managed to get an appointment with a gynecologist a week from now, but of course in the meantime I'm trying to ""translate"" the report for myself so I don't go completely nuts. 🤪

It's a ""large septated cystic mass,""
and ""raises the possibility of a cystic epithelial neoplasm."" It DOES say that no mural nodules were seen (that's a good thing, right?).

So I understand (sort of) most of the above, but then the report mentions ""a fluid signal intensity collection"" that ""demonstrates no significant enhancement""
near the ovary on the side where the cyst is and my cervix and vaginal fornix (?!!). It measures 2.1 x 0.9 cm.

So I'm just trying to understand if that has anything to do with ascites (or anything else relevant). Does it mesn there's fluid where there shouldn't be? Has anyone ever had anything similar going on?

So, as I mentioned in an earlier post, a large (11.9 x 8 x 11 cm.) ""septated cystic mass"" was found pretty much by accident in the ER when they did a CT scan originally. Next I had an ultrasound. My PCP said that so far there aren't any serious signs of malignancy, but I'm having an MRI tomorrow to see the rest, I guess.

My doctor also gave me the CA 125 test, which he said isn't a definite indicator, but might be useful. I just got the results-- normal range (13.1 U/ml.).

So, again, the mass is clearly going to have to come out before it takes over my entire torso (I'm wondering if a cyst that big can be removed laparoscopically). But I'm wondering--I know that ELEVATED ranges on the CA 125 can be misleading because that can be caused by other things, but how much of a sigh of relief (if any) can I take if it's normal?

Has anyone had this experience?

As I've mentioned in other posts, I took brand-name Wellbutrin (300 mg. per day) 20 years ago, and it worked wonders.

However, these days (I started it again about a year ago, but could only get generic, of course) it seems to have little to no effect on me at any dosage I've tried so far--400 mg. is the highest dosage I've tried. I've got mild depression, and, as I suspected, I also have ADHD (great--finding out at age 60!). This morning I spoke to a psychiatrist, particularly to confirm my hunch about the ADHD (once I'd told him some of the many incidents that made me believe that, as well as the fact that my son was dx'd with it in high school, he didn't seem to need any more convincing--I think it's pretty clear). I also told him about the fact that Bupropion doesn't work NEARLY as well for me the first time around, when it felt miraculous.

We discussed ADHD meds, including Strattera, but he seemed to feel strongly that I should try a month or so of 450 mg. Bupropion per day before we try anything else (the idea of stimulants makes me nervous, but if a small dose would work I'd be willing to try it). I told him that I doubted that raising the Bupropion dosage would do much good, but I agreed to give it a try.

The psychiatrist wanted to try to get the 450 XL, once a day, for me, but my insurance won't cover it. So we went to option B, which was 300 mg. in the morning and 150 mg. at night. I assumed they'd both be SR, but when I picked them up I saw that they're both XL, which seemed weird. The pharmacist, however, seems to think it's fine. And I liked the psychiatrist (that's unusual!); he seemed knowledgeable and actually LISTENED to me--remarkable!

So I'm just wondering if anyone has ever tried that combination before (in the XL formulations), and if it helped for either ADHD or depression (or both), or was just too much. I assume that the doctor and the pharmacist know what they're doing, but I'd like to hear about some real-life experiences from anyone who has tried it. It just seems like a LOT!

2514,yes,bupropion,2022-06-24 14:06:08,Naima92231,Will Decreasing My Dosage of Bupropion Improve Memory Issues?,"Hi, all. I have another question about Bupropion.

Twenty years or so I got on 300 mg. Wellbutrin (brand-name at the time!) for depression and other symptoms that, at the time, I didn't realize were probably caused by undiagnosed ADHD. It was AMAZING how well it worked, and (as many others have said here) I felt that I was getting a sense of what it's like to have a ""normal"" (whatever that is :) ), functioning brain. I took it for a few years, and eventually stopped without any issues.

THIS time around, I started it again because I was coming off of about 10 years of Tramadol use (prescribed to me before it was deemed a controlled substance--I still think there should be a class action lawsuit...different subject!). I never took more than 100 mg. per day (usually just 50), but it was hellish to come off of it. Thank God I found that weed made the withdrawal symptoms practically disappear, so I was able to do it. But I figured I might need some help regulating my emotions after that big change, and I also finally realized that I probably really do have ADHD (I'm getting evaluated in a few weeks).

My doctor started me off at 150 mg. Bupropion (I couldn't get the brand-name any more!), and after a couple of weeks went up to 300 mg. XL. I felt exactly zero difference--it wasn't anything like my Wellbutrin experience 20 years ago. I may as well have been taking M & M's.
So I thought, well, maybe I should try 400 mg. per day (2 x 200SR per day). Again...no difference in mood or focus or energy.
However, shortly after I came off of the Tramadol and started Bupropion again, I started to notice memory issues that I'd never noticed before. At first I figured that maybe it was just a side-effect of stopping years of Tramadol use. Mostly, it's short-term stuff--losing the thread of conversations, not being able to remember if I'd already washed my face when I was taking a shower, etc., and--most annoying--these memory ""delays"" in which I'll think of something, immediately forget what it was for a few seconds to a couple of minutes, and then remember again. I HATE it. And so far Bupropion hasn't helped with that either. My brain feels like an old junkyard cluttered with stuff that barely works (when I took the name-brand decades ago that stuff disappeared, like, immediately...it was heavenly).

So now I'm going to experiment with lower doses. Right now I'm at 275 mg. (started yesterday with 200 SR in the morning, and 75 SR in the evening). I'd like to get it down to 150 mg. XL to find out if it might work better and help with memory issues, etc., if I'm on a lower dose. I KNOW that Wellbutrin was the only antidepressant that ever worked for me, so I don't understand why it's not working now.
I do still use weed ONLY at night before bed, because it helps me sleep and stops nighttime/early morning panic attacks cold. It probably takes me close to three months to go through an ounce, so it's really very little.

I've cut down alcohol to maybe a glass of wine (maybe two drinks if I'm out at a restaurant) per day. I know that's not a great idea, but it really is minimal, and I'm pretty sure I drank more than that the first time I took Wellbutrin, and had no issues.

SO (as always, I end up writing overly long posts...sorry!), I'm just trying to find out if anyone can give me any insight into (a) why I might suddenly be having memory issues that I didn't have before, and (b) if anyone has found that Bupropion actually works better, or at least as well, at lower doses.

I'm at my wit's end with this--I was so sure that Bupropion would just kick in and help me as it did the first time I took it, and I'm really disappointed!
Thank you.",13,8,8,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='vjp9cp')>,,/r/bupropion/comments/vjp9cp/will_decreasing_my_dosage_of_bupropion_improve/,,,False
2515,yes,bupropion,2022-06-14 00:11:15,Naima92231,Will My Brain Ever Be Normal Again Post-Tramadol?,"Hi, all. About 11 years ago, my body seemed to be just falling apart for no apparent reason. I could barely sit up most of the time, I was losing weight like crazy (unusual for me, and good until it wasn't), and I was in pain and practically non-functional. I went to a health clinic in FL. At first the doctors thought it might be MS or something, but all that was ruled out. It turned out that I had a serious sensitivity to gluten (I'd never even heard of it before, so I wasn't trying to be trendy--I'd still kill to eat a regular baguette or something), perhaps triggered by some serious stressors at the time.

Anyway, I was prescribed Tramadol. I'd never heard of that either. This was about a year before it was classified as a controlled substance (I keep thinking that the company that made it and passed it off as non-addictive should be sued).

So I started taking it every evening--just 50 mg., although occasionally I'd do 75 or 100 mg. if I was having more pain than usual, or if I needed to be ""up"" for something. At that time I wasn't drinking, fortunately. I did figure out after a while that if I missed a dose I'd start to have withdrawal symptoms, so good call, too late, on re-classifying the drug. :(

I took it for about 10 years altogether--again, never more than 100 mg. tops per day. A year ago I decided it was time to go through the hell of quitting, and, with the help of weed (which usually stopped most of the withdrawal symptoms right away, at least for a while so I could get some sleep), I finally tapered off last May. I will never touch that shit again--it acts as both an SSRI and an opioid, so that really complicates getting off of it.

I started taking Bupropion (Wellbutrin) shortly after that. I'd taken it 20 years earlier, and it was amazing--both for my depression and my ADHD. This time, though, it has had much less of a positive effect on me. I also noticed that once I quit the Tramadol I started having short-term memory problems--kind of like a ""delay,"" where I'd think of something and totally forget what it was for a minute or so, and then remember again. It's been a year, and I'm still on the Bupropion, and I'm still pretty spacey and feel that my ADHD is REALLY bad now.

Sorry for the long background story, but I'm just trying to find out if others who have quit Tramadol had issues with memory, depression, etc., even a year afterwards. I'm 60, so it's possible that I've just been having ""senior moments"" (even though I don't feel like a senior!), but I don't recall having them until just after I quit the Tramadol. It's also upsetting that the Bupropion, which had been life-changing 20 years earlier, has so much less of a positive effect even after taking it for a year (I just upped my dose from 300 mg. to 400 mg. per day about two weeks ago, so I'm waiting to see if that will help). I HATE feeling so stupid and spaced out, and getting so little done because my brain keeps skipping from one thought to another and I'll go off to do something else before I'm done with the first thing. It's embarrassing, and I don't want my son to notice and worry when he comes home from college. I think I'd shoot myself before making him have to take care of me if I got dementia. And my thoughts about myself are often uncharacteristically negative (I'm not suicidal at all--just feeling guilt and shame about so many things in my past).

Anyone out there have similar experiences (preferably encouraging ones, although I need to hear everything)? Thank you.",2,3,3,0.81,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='vbqece')>,,/r/bupropion/comments/vbqece/will_my_brain_ever_be_normal_again_posttramadol/,,,False
2516,yes,CannabisExtracts,2022-05-18 18:07:21,Naima92231,Is Dosage the Same for High-THC Tinctures If Swallowed Instead of Taken Sublingually?,"Hi all. I've been experimenting with making tinctures with high-THC flower and Everclear. So far I've only used them sublingually, with mixed results, but my most recent mixture (23% THC flower; about 2 ounces Everclear per 1/8th ounce bud; sat for a week) seemed to work best so far. With that, I've found that about 1.5 ml. makes me feel it, but not too strongly.
I've been considering just swallowing it so that it lasts longer (I mostly use it to help me sleep at night without weird panic attacks that seem to come out of nowhere in the middle of the night or first thing in the morning, and also to listen to music as I fall asleep--the latter is one of my favorite activities, because I feel as if I hear every nuance of every instrument, and it's beautiful!). But I'm wondering if the dosage should be the same if I just drink it, or if the effects will be stronger. I wouldn't mind having a somewhat more intense experience, but ONE time I ate ONE gummy (I'm not sure how many mg. it was), and felt like I was going to die for several hours (thank God my son told me not to take more than one, because if I'd taken two I think I'd have ended up in the ER). I don't want to repeat that experience (although I think my tolerance is a little higher now)!
So--bottom line--given that I've used the same recipe and flower to make a tincture, would 1.5 ml. sublingually be the same as 1.5 ml. swallowed? I know that I'll have to wait a lot longer to feel the effects, so I'd like to avoid waiting 2 hours worrying if I'm going to be pleasantly high, or curled up in fetal position in bed, waiting for it to be over!",9,2,2,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='usiyuf')>,,/r/CannabisExtracts/comments/usiyuf/is_dosage_the_same_for_highthc_tinctures_if/,,,False
2517,yes,AskVet,2022-04-22 13:45:51,Naima92231,Seasonal/vaccine-related seizures in 5-6-year-old dog?,"Hello. I have a very healthy 6-year-old Pit/Boxer mix (about 52 lbs.) whom I adopted from a shelter when she was a few months old. Aside from occasional GI issues (short-lived, and never terribly serious--the usual stuff), she's never had a health problem. She IS, however, an anxious dog who gets nervous when things change, or aren't in their usual places, etc. She falls in love with everyone she meets, but is very unwilling to go on walks, etc., with anyone except me. She is a sweetheart.
About 2 years ago, around May or early June, she had her first two 2 relatively mild seizure events (no loss of consciousness or ""paddling""--just unable to stand, shaking violently, smacking her lips, and looking terrified) about a week apart. Her vet checked her blood, and said that everything looked normal. There were no more incidents until...
The following spring, last year, she went to the vet 2 separate times within a few weeks for her boosters and rabies shots. Within between a few days to about 3 weeks after both visits, she had multiple instances of the same kind of events of varying length and severity (again, no loss of consciousness, etc., although one time she lost control of her bowels, which would NEVER happen otherwise).
I talked to the vet about it, and she asked me to keep a log. I also asked her about CBD, and, although she couldn't ""officially"" recommend it, she did say that some of her patients had had good results with it. So I started her on CBD oil--.5 ml. of 1200 mg. oil 2x per day.
A week after we started the CBD oil (I believe it takes a little time to start working), she had another 9-minute long episode (I got video of that one). It was awful, but, as usual when it ended she was back to normal and just wanted to go outside. That was 23 days after her last booster last year. It was on April 30th, and she had no more until...
Exactly one week after THIS year's boosters, which were given on 30 March, she had another episode. She was shaking so hard I was terrified she'd die. After about 5 very long minutes, she was fine again.
(I should also mention that she had an apparently benign mast cell tumor removed from near one of her nipples a few months ago, in winter, and she's recovered well, except that she is now terrified of the vet's office...understandably, as the procedure was no doubt really frightening for her. But there were no subsequent seizures then.)
Sorry for the long background story!
Of course I started to associate the seizure events as being related to the vaccinations, but I've seen very little reliable info online making that correlation, and the vet says it's not likely. But why do they always happen only in the spring, and within a few weeks of boosters?
The other thing I learned from ""Dr. Google, Veterinary Edition"" is that boosters for distemper/parvo/bordatella, etc., only usually need to be given every THREE years--NOT every year, as we've been doing per the vet office's suggestions. I've also read that multiple vaccinations boosters given at one time might be too much.
So...long story short... could this all somehow be coincidence? I'm wondering if (a) she's predisposed to seizures, and either the stress of the vet visits and/or the boosters themselves can trigger them, or if they can be seasonal. (I don't use fertilizers or pesticides in the yard, she doesn't go to dog parks, and we take our walks on city streets, away from other dogs. I have no plans to ever board her anywhere.)
One more thing--she's EXTREMELY heat-intolerant, which I assume is due to the Boxer in her.

it’s the one unpredictable thing, isn’t it? no matter how perfect and wonderful everything else in your life is, no matter how hard you’ve worked and how close you are to having everything you’ve wanted, your partner can get in a fatal crash on a tuesday night on the way back from work and it’s over. i play scenarios endlessly. and what does it mean for me? do i kill myself? i couldn’t do it. i’d have to abandon all my goals. what would it feel like to truly give up and die all alone? the possibilities are infinite and you have no control. i think about this WAY too much. it makes me feel so sick. i’m afraid of driving now because of it.

i also have autism, pure ocd, and other shit, so i’m sure it’s just the perfect storm for this fear. the safer i feel, the more it triggers this, because i think “now would be a perfect time to utterly destroy me just when i’m feeling safe, in a way i could never come back from.”",8,6,6,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='12hqvix')>,,/r/CPTSD/comments/12hqvix/intense_fear_of_partner_dying/,,,False

we are in between an old meal and a new one, and making the new one tonight, so those days in between are often hard for me. i don’t really snack. i’m afraid eventually i’ll get sick of every food we can think of making, and i’ll have nothing left. that sounds absurd, but it’s not totally unrealistic. i’m already almost sick of all the recipes i’ve worked hard to collect. my appetite is so bad it scares me, and i’m sick of being hungry so often. i wish i had safe foods at all, but i get tired of every single thing if i eat it too much. the only thing approaching a safe food for me is more like “save for emergencies,” because if i eat it too much, i’ll get sick of it and it won’t be an option anymore. is this a form of ARFID? it doesn’t sound like descriptions, but it’s absolutely a distressing disorder of some kind, even if it doesn’t have a name.

edit: idk what other symptoms are ARFID-like, but i can get sick of being around food, especially smells. it used to be much worse when i was severely depressed. i couldn’t even talk about food or see an image of food without feeling sick. i fucking hate fast food ads. i have sensory processing disorder though.

i’ve found that i’m a highly sensory person, more than what is typically seen in autism. i’m very passionate about nature and art, and i have quite bad sensory processing issues. i am in love with sensations like touch, smell, etc. and i am unbelievably sensitive to my environment. it’s like there is no barrier. if it’s unclean, ugly, reminds me of trauma, loud, uncomfortable in any way, and so forth. i’m equally sensitive to pleasant things, so it can be very pleasurable, but also debilitating. 

i find that i need a lot of variety and novelty as a person, and hate routine. doesn’t sound too autistic, i know. but where i desperately need things to stay the same is my environment. it’s so hard for me to deal with sensory stressors, and if i can ever find a safe and comfortable enough space, i’m so disturbed if things change without my say-so.

we are moving in a couple months. i’m extremely worried. after almost a decade, i’ve found a place i feel at home in, and i really like. the traffic sounds torment me constantly, so i wouldn’t miss that, but i know being uprooted will be hellish, especially since i have fibromyalgia and CPTSD, which i know will be triggered by everything. to make matters worse, we have to stay in a camper for a short time between finding a house. more instability. the house will be new and unknown, so i won’t feel safe or like i can hide, there will be boxes everywhere. i know i may really like our next place, but it won’t have any of the quirks of our house now, so i’ll constantly be comparing and won’t let it go. 

i’m so worried. i am not being pessimistic or psyching myself out to say that i’m certain i will get terribly shutdown and my pain will flare up from all the stress. this wasn’t really the main point of the post, but it’s related, so i guess i wanted to share it. if you have anything to say about either points, i’d appreciate some info/support. thanks.",2,10,10,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='122xwgf')>,,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/122xwgf/does_you_intolerance_for_change_involve_the/,,,False

2632,yes,Fibromyalgia,2023-03-20 18:03:04,spiritomine,got denied medicaid for a THIRD time. feeling really depressed.,"i moved to north carolina over a year ago to be with my partner. the decision to live with him has been life saving, but moving to charlotte is been horrible for me. i have fibro, as well as CPTSD, autism, and pure OCD. i have never lived in a city before and it’s seriously worsened my pain and fatigue due to constant sensory overload, not enough nature and privacy that i’m used to, and nowhere to go. it’s an extremely boring city. 

i’m too unwell to work either, so i’ve been stuck at home for a year. i used to have full medicaid in ohio and michigan, but now they refuse it to me, despite jumping through all the hoops i could find and giving them my long medical history with medicaid in the past. i can’t fucking believe they denied me a third time. that’s two applications and one appeal. i am afraid we will be trapped in this city for another full year, since to break the lease we need to cough up three goddamn rent sums. that’s $3k. there’s no way we can ever make that unless i get a job too. 

i’ve tried to hard to find a way to work, but i’m so sick that i’m worthless to the work force. at this point though, maybe i’ll call the disability office and try to use them to get work somehow. i keep getting worse. i can’t stay here. i’ve been reduced to a wheelchair when i used to travel and work all the time. shameful.",18,17,17,0.85,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='11wq7m6')>,,/r/Fibromyalgia/comments/11wq7m6/got_denied_medicaid_for_a_third_time_feeling/,,,False

it also often comes off as me being overly nasty towards these groups of people for superficial reasons. my distress can make me feel cornered and aggressive. of course they never see it, but i hate feeling anger and disgust and intense anxiety just because they remind me of bad memories. it just happened a half hour ago and my body hurts. i’m also autistic, which i think makes me more sensitive to triggers like this.",4,2,2,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='11v4zig')>,,/r/CPTSD/comments/11v4zig/mistrusting_whole_groups_of_people_due_to_trauma/,,,False

ASPD and schizoid can be imagined as a quite effective response to abuse: trust no one and feel nothing. someone could have anger issues and generally be an asshole because it’s safer for the brain to act out offensively than let itself be vulnerable and process any trauma.

When I applied for my current job 10 months ago I was very clear in my interview that I had left my previous job because it was an unprofessional environment where people brought their personal problems into work. I was VERY clear that I wasn’t interested in an environment like that. I was assured that it was a professional office. At first it was. Then fast forward a few weeks and truths start to come out. Sure enough there is a very unprofessional relationship within management. At first it wasn’t affecting our day to day. But I could see the handwriting on the wall. I could feel the impending separation. Over the last few month things haven not been going well with them and it has created several awkward situations, many of which I was able to be “busy” during and avoid. Well now things have escalated in a negative direction for their relationship and I am so close to quitting. Today was unbearable. It was like being suffocated in this toxic cloud of awkward vibes and I wanted to jump out of my skin and let my skeleton run free down the street. I can’t handle it. It’s so stressful for me to know all this personal stuff about them and feel them both radiating anger and hurt all day. I feel like I need to wring out my soul from their sludge vibes!!!

I have come to realize that what is “hip” when it comes to socks is a pattern.

Currently the “hip” thing for socks right now is white tube socks that go above the knee almost like a high sock. Back when I was a teenager the “hip” thing was short ankle black socks. My generation thought high white tube socks was an old person thing. Now gen Z thinks short ankle black socks are an old person thing. Back in the 90’s high white tube socks was hip, they thought black socks were an old people thing. It’s a 1 2 1 2 1 2 pattern. The next gen after gen Z will think high white tube socks are old ppl things.

(You can skip this part it just explains why i believe I am on the spectrum) I grew up always feeling different than everyone else.

I enjoy IPA and lagers and other beers because they’re usually higher in alcohol content so they have about 7%+ most of the time so you can drink one and feel content and buzzed. They also have more flavor and are genuinely enjoyable to drink.

My favorite at the moment is voodoo ranger 9.5% Fruit haze (the ones in the orange can) because they taste good, and one can will get you nice and buzzed for a while. So you spend less money, drink less to get the same buzz as drinking about 3-4 regular light beers and they don’t give you hang overs because they don’t have much sugar.

Is this just an autistic mindset ? I think about consuming alcohol very objectively. If I have the option between a light beer and water I’d rather drink just water.

How do you feel about this? (If you drink of course, if you don’t I understand)

Update: seems like most of you don’t really enjoy drinking but for the few that do they seem to enjoy hard ciders and lagers and fruity mixed drinks or a form of gin or vodka. It appears people who actually enjoy light beers are in the minority.

2801,yes,darkstartril,2023-05-17 17:02:35,HamburgerDude,This newly translated novel sounds like a Brazilian take on BLRW but it was written in 1928,"https://fitzcarraldoeditions.com/books/macunaima

Just came out today. I thought some of you all would be interested!

> Here at last is an exciting new translation of the modernist Brazilian epic Macunaíma, by Mário de Andrade. This landmark novel from 1928 has been hugely influential. It follows the adventures of the shapeshifting Macunaíma and his brothers as they leave their home in the northern Amazon for a whirlwind tour of Brazil, cramming four centuries and a continental expanse into a single mythic plane. Having lost a magic amulet, the hero and his brothers journey to São Paulo to retrieve the talisman that has fallen into the hands of an Italo-Peruvian captain of industry (who is also a cannibal giant). Written over six delirious days – the fruit of years of study – Macunaíma magically synthesizes dialect, folklore, anthropology, mythology, flora, fauna, and pop culture to examine Brazilian identity. This brilliant translation by Katrina Dodson has been many years in the making and includes an extensive section of notes providing essential background information for this magnificent work.",2,10,10,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13k7mgc')>,,/r/darkstartril/comments/13k7mgc/this_newly_translated_novel_sounds_like_a/,,,False

2859,yes,Dynavap,2023-05-03 01:01:31,HamburgerDude,Controversial Opinion: my favorite feature of the dynavap is you can be lazy about cleaning.,"Unless you're a heavy user with more than like 3-4 sessions a day.

I have had my implant since I think about August of 2020 (I was originally set for three years, but recently my gynecologist told me they updated the effectiveness to four years, so I still have a little over a year until I get it replaced), and usually I don't get my period on it at all. Occasionally, I will still spot or get my actual period, and I've noticed that there seems to be a pattern to it: it only happens if I've been sexually active, specifically with a guy, and specifically in person. It does not happen if I'm sexting (like, I had a long distance thing with someone, and I experienced the same level of arousal I would in person, but I didn't get a period or spot), it doesn't happen when I masturbate, and it doesn't seem to have any correlation with whether or not I orgasm (based on what's happening currently) or whether or not I've had actual penetrative sex. Most recently, I started seeing someone new, and actually started having a bit of cramping before we even did anything more than like, cuddling. As of yesterday, we've just made out a lot and fooled around a little bit, and today I started spotting and I'm a bit bloated.
This might sound nuts, but based on my experiences so far, I would say it almost seems like a response to like... pheromones or proximity to male hormones or something that triggers it? And not stimulation of my pelvic floor muscles or any of the other explanations I came across in this sub. Has anyone else noticed anything like this happening to them?

A couple years ago, I binged through the entirety of the Vampire Diaries and the Originals. Sometime after, I did a rewatch of TVD because I had gotten my sister into it. More recently, we finally got around to watching through the Originals (second time for me) and I noticed that it only had 5 seasons, when I could have absolutely *sworn* there were 6. I know that this might at first seem like just a case of misremembering, which I do occasionally have trouble with, but in this particular instance, I am absolutely *positive* that it had 6 seasons. It didn't seem to be exactly missing much plot-wise, with the exception of this one somewhat minor detail I thought I remembered involving some kind of cursed fountain. There was one final red flag in there though, and that was that my favorite scene (from the end of S3E22, ""The Bloody Crown"") was different than I remembered, and not as cool or as impactful.

2914,yes,ADHD,2021-05-11 19:45:55,mandelaXeffective,Improved procedural memory as compensatory adaptation for working memory deficits?,"So there is something I've noticed about myself that I am curious about.

The first way I noticed it was when I used to dance. In dance classes, it always seemed like it would take me a bit longer than my classmates to learn each piece of a routine. However, once I *did* manage to learn it, I would often (and I'm not just saying that this was just how I perceived it, my teachers usually noticed too) seem to actually know it better, somehow, than my classmates. I hadn't been diagnosed yet at the time (I was diagnosed when I was 19), so I had no idea why that might be, but now (at 27) that I have been diagnosed, medicated, and have learned more about ADHD, this is the best explanation I can come up with:

The difficulty and delay in learning the routines would make sense in the context of ADHD-related working memory deficits, so that part was pretty easy to figure out; the rest of it didn't make as much sense until I was having a hard time explaining to my family why I was so rigid about my morning routine and where I kept the stuff I needed to get up, get dressed, eat, and get to work, and why it was so *disruptive* if something wasn't where it was supposed to be or if I ran out of cereal or anything like that. I didn't know. Then when I started joining a lot of ADHD Facebook groups, this subreddit etc., it occurred to me that the fact that I almost never lose my keys or my wallet or my purse (my phone is another story) and that I almost never forget any of the above when going out was actually kind of unusual for someone with ADHD, and I started to make the connection: I somehow seemed to have adapted to compensate for my working memory problems with strong *procedural* memory in certain areas of my life. Instead of trying to hold ""purse, phone, keys, water bottle, jacket"" etc. in my working memory every time I go to walk out the door, I only have to hold ""phone, water bottle, jacket"" etc., which is much more manageable. My keys and my purse have designated spots, which are both close to each other and close to the door. Grabbing them is a practiced set of fluid motions, like a dance, and takes very little thought. I use this for a lot of things and I'm apparently very good at it. 
Anyways that's a very long explanation for a very short question: has anyone else noticed this about themselves?",10,21,21,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='na5t9b')>,,/r/ADHD/comments/na5t9b/improved_procedural_memory_as_compensatory/,,,False
2915,yes,CreditScore,2021-05-08 20:13:56,mandelaXeffective,Credit score took a big hit because of car accident (not at fault),"So my car was totaled back in December (it got hit while it was parked in my driveway). I got a payout for the majority of my remaining loan from the insurance of the guy who hit it, which took a while and I had to make a payment on that loan in the process. Before that went through, another payment came due and I absolutely could not afford to make another payment on a car I no longer had, since I had already bought another one, which I now needed to start paying off. So it was past due when the insurance payout went through. For some odd reason, the payout didn't count as a payment, so it just continued to become increasingly delinquent. I had gap insurance on the car I lost, so the account did end up paid off completely, but that only just got put through like, last week.

Before all this, I had worked really hard to get my credit score up over 700 (729 on TransUnion, 730 on EquiFax) and when I was replacing the car I lost was finally able to get approved for a loan without a cosigner. The inquiries to get the new loan obviously dinged my score a bit (about 40 points), but I was prepared for that.
But the delays with getting the other loan paid off caused it to go down *another* 40 or so points and since getting it paid off, it has only gone back up about 5 points. Am I gonna have to basically build it back up all over again? Or is it just too soon to see the impact of getting the old loan cleared?
And if it's the former, is there *anything* I can do about it? It seems really unfair.",5,1,1,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='n7xh04')>,,/r/CreditScore/comments/n7xh04/credit_score_took_a_big_hit_because_of_car/,,,False

2917,yes,medical_advice,2021-04-16 17:33:26,mandelaXeffective,Air bubbles stuck after swallowing pills,"So for quite a while now, I've been having this issue where I get really bad, painful  stomach gas after I take my medications, or just swallow pills in general. I always swallow pills with water. It doesn't happen every single time, but I would say it happens more often than not. It's quite painful (probably about a 4 on the pain scale) and most of the pain is in my chest, so I'm not actually sure if it's gas in my stomach or if it's in my esophagus. Once it happens, I find it very difficult to burp to expel it. I'm pretty sure the fact that I'm swallowing air and the fact that it's getting stuck are two separate issues, and the latter has actually been happening as a general problem for over a year now (sometimes spontaneously), though it's otherwise improved more recently. 
I've had both a colonoscopy and upper endoscopy (a little over a year ago now) as well xrays of my chest and abdomen, and the only abnormal finding was a tortuous colon. No hiatal hernia or any other abnormalities were found in my stomach or esophagus (my mom has a hiatal hernia, so that was one of the first things we checked for).
When I do manage to burp, if it's first thing in the morning and I haven't eaten, the burps have an unusual taste that I can really only describe as being akin to canned mushrooms. 
I do not smoke and I very rarely chew gum or drink soda or other carbonated beverages.

I am a 27 y.o. female (nonbinary, she/they)
Everyone in my immediate family, myself included, has a prescription for omeprazole to treat GERD.

I still can't stop. I still give people who hurt me chance after chance because except in very specific moments where I am reminded or thinking about it, like right now.

The decorations are space themed (dark blue, some white, a tiny bit of bright green). Lisa Frank/rainbow and cartoons (rainbow, bright green). And a collection of cutesy things, which have some bright green but mostly pink and lavender.

The purple and dark blue walls will touch, and the light colored walls will touch. My idea is that the rainbow and cartoon deco will go against the purple wall. The cutesy deco will go against the white wall, and the light blue and dark blue wall will have most of the space deco.

The bedroom is 4 walls, and the color palette is here for the walls: [https://colorkit.co/palette/020c61-e9faff-ffffff-500461/](https://colorkit.co/palette/020c61-e9faff-ffffff-500461/)

The decorations are space themed (dark blue, some white, a tiny bit of bright green). Lisa Frank/rainbow and cartoons (rainbow, bright green). And a collection of cutesy things, which have some bright green but mostly pink and lavender.

The purple and dark blue walls will touch, and the light colored walls will touch. My idea is that the rainbow and cartoon deco will go against the purple wall. The cutesy deco will go against the white wall, and the light blue and dark blue wall will have most of the space deco. Because every collection of decorations has a bit of bright green, I feel like that will help it feel more well-rounded.

A heads up, this is a long post talking about myself and stuff I like lol. If you like the same stuff, reach out? :)

I have Friendproject and email to keep in touch on. If I'm not able to access my laptop I probably just can't chat, so I prefer messaging on email or friendproject to chatting- I have a 12-key phone and typing just for fun isn't fun lolol. This is usually a disqualifier. I do have discord but I rarely use it. It glitches pretty bad and I miss messages, I never figured out how to fix it.

\-

I'm interested in horror, especially horror films but also novels and psychological horror of any kind. Crime thrillers and crime-drama-thrillers are my favorite genres, top movies have to be... Faces in the Crowd and Before I go to Sleep. Love that kind of movie. I also hate-watch Lifetime Movie Network stuff and hatewatching movies is one of my favorite things to do lol.

I used to write fiction and fanfiction, and roleplay novella too, but at the moment I'm not in a good place to do that, always too much going on to really sit and focus on it. Ever read any BatJokes? You might've read one of mine...

I hope to get back there one day but in the meantime I'm focusing on pixel/digital art and plotting out future novels, TV shows, whatever- I like creating, in any form. And creativity, so anything you have to share, I have eyes to read or see it lol.

I'm super into like, mid 2000s-alternative aesthetics and just nostalgia in general. Hence the 12-key flip phone. I've been watching Invader Zim and other shows I used to like; South Park, The Looney Tunes Show (the sitcom one, not the originals), Danny Phantom.

I also am getting into Korean drama and horror series, right now I'm watching Flowers of Evil and I'm partway through it and I've always loved Korean horror in general. Not too into Kpop specifically but I like some songs here and there like with any genre- my playlists are allllll over the place fr.

Some of my more cringe interests that I'm getting back into are scene aesthetic, Vocaloid, and cartoons (like Danny Phantom, Invader Zim, etc). And probably a lot more? Idk, I'm pretty unashamedly cringe lmao. I wear my autism on my sleeve and I'm super queer and love that about me. I lost myself trying to hide the cringe and I was never more unhappy in life than then, lol. I'm happier now that I'm being me again.

&#x200B;

Oh, also, I LOVE the subject of psychology and especially abnormal and developmental psychology. I could talk about theories and research on those subjects for hours (but I won't, unless you want to). If you know anything about autism, psychology is my all-time special interest. Followed by autism itself, which feels like its own branch of psychology?

spoons had run out with about four hours to go. tried to have a chat with a person and it was awkward so kept out of the way as much as possible until i had to do more work.

then people were kind and offered to help me out with work but i declined because i didn't have the energy to do the masking (sometimes the masking is friendly and okay but sometimes it doesn't function properly and i seem a bit odd but try and other times - very rarely - i don't try and i am just silent) but help would've been nice to be honest. also, i think refusing help is probably not very good for good social relations as i know i can come across as a bit aloof - sometimes the masking is quite good but if i have time for free social chat it is usually a bit of a nightmare generally.

i wanted to say ""i appreciate your offer of help and i would take it but i find social stuff quite difficult and i don't know you guys very well and i would concentrate more on the communication than my job and i would find that harder than refusing your help"" but i am guessing that would sound very weird (i'm not out at work obviously). 

anyway, how do you deal with this situation? my job's management failures are making these situations arise where i have to refuse help when i shouldn't need help but i am also aware that i'm not really sure how i can learn what to do when i run out of spoons. i guess it would be nice to be awkward/odd and people didn't think anything of it (or to not have to talk/interact but that seems unlikely). if the spoons are gone they are gone. usually, before learning about spoons (i'm a late learner about these things), i would end up leaving jobs because of this kind of thing.",9,8,8,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='121xt4h')>,,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/121xt4h/what_are_you_doing_if_the_spoons_have_run_out_but/,,,False

i was referred to a local mental health team but it has been months and it is so difficult to talk to anyone. they call me and either i miss the call or i'm really not prepared for the call so i don't answer. i call back and they are either engaged or i speak to a receptionist and nobody is available and they will call me back but it takes hours and i do not feel like talking at that point. i asked if i could communicate with them via email but apparently the receptionist can't give out any emails because the person who has the email address would have to agree. i was thinking of writing a letter but i'm worried they will just tell me to call. i am okay with appointments where i have to see someone because i see that as a situation where i have to be in a room and at least something will happen (and i have practiced this way of thinking with seeing the doctor and it has worked. i am still polite and don't say how bad things really are but i have written things down and have spoken more than i ever have - but my doctor changed and my new doctor has basically referred me to this mental health team and said they are just their for medication reviews so the one place i started to feel relatively comfortable talking feels closed off).

i've asked family for support but again, talking isn't so great  so i emailed and they haven't mentioned anything to me. it has been a week. i'm not sure what to do. my work doesn't make me feel so good and i have had interview dates for a few new jobs but i can't bring myself to go and cancel and i'm closing doors that maybe could make things a bit better and i don't want to but i think not having the interviews is better than turning up and having a rough time at the moment as it will sink my mood even more.

the sinking down to a very low place is in progress and i'm aware my reaction to this is becoming progressively worse. i'm not sure what the point of this post is but i guess it is just nice to be able to say it somewhere.",0,1,1,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='118gcsa')>,,/r/depression/comments/118gcsa/feeling_kind_of_bad_lately/,,,False

2960,yes,penpalsover30,2023-02-13 13:44:58,No-Macaroon-9902,38M UK here for penpals,"Hello,

I'm a single man who lives in one of the quiet corners of the UK. 

I once had a penpal from South Korea for 8 years. We didn't send each other lots of letters but once or twice a year it was always nice to send and receive something.

I'm looking for email conversation to begin with and if we both want to I am happy to move to real letters instead/as well.

The main thing that interests me in life is music. I like many genres of music. I started listening to pop music around 10, moved to hip-hop at 12, found punk at 15, found noise at 20 and from there it has been a bit of everything. My constant companions seem to be jazz and minimal classical music. I sometimes prefer sound to music. I like that there are people who have spent time thinking about what we think of as music and what we think of as noise. I also like that some people apply this type of thinking to natural sounds and how we influence them.

I like nature. I don't think I know too much about nature but I know I like walking and looking at the birds and insects and tufts of grass a person might stumble across. Hills or the coast are my favourites. 

I am not very good at watching tv shows or films at home. I prefer watching films at the cinema but it is difficult to find a cinema that doesn't just show new films from America. I do realise this is probably because the cinemas want to make money. 

I recently bought a piano and after not having access to instruments while living abroad for the past 7 years I am enjoying it very much. I'm not sure anybody else with ears would enjoy it but thankfully I can plug in headphones.

I can generally hold a conversation and find people quite interesting. Text based me is better at conversation than flesh based me. It would be nice to share some interests with someone but sometimes it is more interesting when people are very different. I probably prefer science fiction to other fiction. I am not a miserable person but do have longterm experience with depression. I like to drink tea and eat marmalade on toast. I like creativity even if that creativity is deemed not very good.",1,2,2,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='1118kpb')>,,/r/penpalsover30/comments/1118kpb/38m_uk_here_for_penpals/,,,False
2961,yes,pianolearning,2023-02-07 09:28:34,No-Macaroon-9902,If you were a beginner wanting to play jazz piano how would you structure your learning?,"The music I listen to the most is jazz and I would love be able to play and understand what I've been listening to for years - and to improvise and compose myself.

I recently bought a digital piano (Yamaha P45) and I am now ready to learn.

I have found a local teacher who will help me with the ABRSM grades but I was wondering how other people would go about reaching my goal of being able to play jazz (not just learning others' songs but to improvise and compose myself).

If following the ABRSM classical route is a good way to go at what stage should I start moving my learning over to something more jazz focused? Do you recommend trying to make it to grade 8 in theory and practice before even looking at jazz? 

Apologies if my question is very naive!

i've been slowly moving my life towards one that is a bit kinder to myself/easier to manage but there are things that i feel that i want to do but just can't seem to do. depending on the day these can be small things or things that have been long term goals that i still can't seem to start.

i haven't been able to make all the changes in my life i would like to make but i thought the other changes would make things easier but i don't seem to be able to make any difference and it is getting quite frustrating. in the past it was frustrating but i see now that i wasn't really helping myself but now, as i feel i'm doing things that are helpful, it feels maybe even more frustrating.

2963,yes,autismUK,2023-01-05 12:13:15,No-Macaroon-9902,Anyone else good at seeming initially okay at fitting in but over time not fitting in much?,"I think I am writing this with the hope of hearing other people having the same experience but things are feeling a bit lonely at the moment.

I've been working at a place for about six months and I'm quite good at being basic friendly (I think) and I can't help but being a people pleaser (hoping to change that - I've been saying this for about 12 years) but beyond that I have no idea how to really be a person and I've reached that stage where I am noticing my inability to have conversation and realising other people have noticed as well. I've started falling back onto my avoidant behaviours so I don't have to have social interactions but I see that they make my life harder.

I think what happens is that I seem friendly to start with so people maybe think I will be a person who will be friendly but the problem is that initial friendly is all I have to offer. I feel a bit like a robot who only has one setting. I see now that I should maybe try to get help for this problem rather than structuring my life so I don't have to deal with social things much (it hasn't made life very satisfying and usually the problems with the social side create anxiety so I go a bit avoidant and then that makes life more difficult and I end up depressed).

Is anyone else a bit like this? How have you made this problem not such a problem? I've reduced my hours at work because in the past I would usually try to continue as normal and spiral into a deep depressive state but I really don't want to be unemployed again. Reducing my hours does mean I can't pay rent to so I am going to be living with family for the foreseeable future (a situation I was really hoping to change by summer). This is the first time in my life I have really noticed how other people communicate and that I am kind of on my own with not being a part of that (it has taken me about 20 years to realise). I don't think I want to learn how to be a part of that side of things but I would like to know how to not feel uncomfortable and not let that uncomfortableness dictate my life. I am not expecting that to be solved on reddit, don't worry!",9,16,16,0.92,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='103xhw9')>,,/r/autismUK/comments/103xhw9/anyone_else_good_at_seeming_initially_okay_at/,,,False

So, he talked me into accepting the full service and everything looked legit. They had me sign some papers and they left with half the money ($200 USD). They came back the day after and “fixed” it, I paid them another $200 + tip. Two hours later, the washing machine wasn’t working anymore.

I immediately called them and they told me not to worry, they would come back the day after. That was last Wednesday and they haven’t. Every time I call them they give me a bs excuse and promise me they’ll come soon.

Mind you, I’m not from the US, things like this are a little more informal in my country, so it’s not necessarily strange to pay people upfront and just trust they will complete the service, normally there are no problems.

But, I’m feeling iffy about this and I’m now assuming I’ve been scammed for $400 USD. I’m researching my legal options, but knowing my country’s justice system, I don’t have a lot of hope.

This is not the first time something like this happens to me (fortunately not as expensive), but I’m constantly in situations where people just take advantage of me and I don’t notice until later or when someone else tells me what happened.

It makes me so frustrated, since I’m 33 and whenever I try to do adult things, I always mess them up.

I’ve been using testosterone gel for over a decade (probably close to 15 years? I don’t really remember when I switched from injections to gel) and I’ve been applying it to my upper arms / shoulders for at least half that time. 

I’ve always understood that the gel works systemically more than locally, but I’m wondering if there’s a degree of local action because I have a curious strip of coarse body hair on the backs of my arms, just below where I apply the gel, rather than exactly where the gel is applied.

Anyone else use gel long-term and see curious growth patterns in their body hair?

Basically, one of my preferred genres of TV is comedy, but I can't deal with sitcoms. When a character does something remarkably questionable, i.e. the whole premise of sitcoms, I feel so embarrassed for them that I cannot watch. I cover my eyes, look anywhere but the TV, develop an overwhelming interest in the stray strings on my bracelet. Grit my teeth until it is over. It almost physically hurts because I am really good at blundering full speed ahead and realizing only later that I once again made an utter fool of myself. It doesn't feel like it is happening to me, but I just have this visceral reaction. This should be my cup of tea, but instead it is horrible. My partner watches a particularly popular show that has been in reruns since before I was born. Nightly. My husband before him watched the same show. I can identify an episode in seconds without seeing the screen, so I should be numb to this by now, but it is still ... Uncomfortable? Painful? I don't know how to describe it. 
In real life, I don't tend to sense people's emotions until they hit me over the head with them, but these shows make it pretty clear what is coming. 
Part of it may be that much of what I learned of how to exist in society was by negative example. Mom saying ""that person is so ugly they shouldn't be allowed to breed"" (gosh, mom, what do you think about me, then?) Or calling someone else's kid an ""unsuccessful biological experiment"".

3230,yes,modernwarfare2,2023-03-12 15:18:51,bwssoldya,Lag or performance issues or something else?,"So I've been noticing that when I play during my peak hours (EU, CEST+2), the game seems to be a lot more...Laggy? I'm not entirely sure if that's the right word for it, but I notice a difference in timing between what happens on an enemies screen (or the server) and what happens on my screen. I play mostly HC so it's mostly a feeling throughout the game and the only proof I get is I'm the final death of the round. 

What it often feels like while playing is that I peek a corner or run around a corner and I get instantly popped. It feels like I have \~200ms at best to see an enemy and react and by the time I do I'm already dead. But when I watch the kill cam on the final kill of the game or I go play soft core, I see that the server or the enemy or whatever had me on their screen at least a second, second and a half, maybe even two before they even start shooting. 

Now this might sound complainey or whiney, but that's not what I'm trying to do here. If I get outplayed I get out played, fair enough. Bit of latency every now and then is fine as well. But this is something else. This is something I only notice during weekends or evenings. If I boot up MW2 in the mornings or during lunch I don't feel this...lag...for lack of a better word, at all. 

This leads me to believe that this isn't an issue on my end and the scoreboard seems to confirm that, as my ping usually hovers between < 10 and 20ms. I run at \~ 70-80fps range in the game as well and I have no other programs downloading in the background or whatever. And for a spot of context; I'm running a Ryzen 5 2500x, RTX3070, 16GB RAM, on win 10 with a wired connection to a full duplex gigabit fiber connection. I \_shouldn't\_ have any issues on my end.

The only things I can think of is maybe I'm just a bit slow, mentally, at some times during the evening / weekend...I mean...it's an option, I'm going through some shit, but it doesn't \_feel\_ like that's the issue, I feel like there should be a greater variance in how much this happens and it should be less time bound. Or the other thing is that maybe there's some...I don't know...congestion(?) on the servers? The servers being a bit laggy? But then why do my enemies not seem to be bothered by it all that much? 

I have no idea what's causing it, but it's frustrating as heck because it basically stops me from playing when I \_want\_ to play or \_have time\_ to play. I do still play during those times, but I'm not having fun what so ever.

After having played for something in the region of 5 hours over the course of the last week or so I find myself wondering ""how is 2042 still in a state like this, almost a year after launch?"". In those 5 hours I've had about as many crashes to desktop, the Portal search filters still reset every time after you go back to the main menu, TDM is not even an option in the filters anymore, there is still no hardcore game mode available and TDM is still unavailable in the base game. Animations often feel laggy or janky, the weapon and specialist balance is all over the place, the game's menu's and UI are still confusing and illogical as all heck, attempting to join a server that is currently switching maps just gives you a random ass error notice with a UUID and you're just supposed to know that this means ""we can't let you join because we're switching maps, try again in 5 minutes"" and that's not even mentioning the serious lack of content. 

Since last I played, almost a year ago, they've added 2 new maps, something like 5-6 new weapons, of which a decent chunk are old weapons from previous games getting introduced into the base game and like 2 new specialists. And the worst thing? That's just the base game, Portal got no new content as far as I can tell.

DICE, what the heck is going on there? Are you alright? How is this game still *this* buggy after almost a year of dev time? And don't say ""covid has been challenging"", COVID is not the issue here. Everyone's back to work and either in office or WFH and we're all doing fine. That's not an excuse anymore. 

I'm not pissed off or anything, I'm just sad and disappointed. 2042 could've been so frigging awesome and such a wonderful game. But I'm starting to doubt it will ever be that. I don't mind the rocky launch, look at BF4, very rocky launch, but it got fixed over time and content got added and I still play it to this day. It's fantastic, I love that game.

3235,yes,raisedbyborderlines,2022-07-16 21:24:35,bwssoldya,"No mom, just because you're my blood doesn't make you my family","*insert vin diesel here*


Had a BBQ with the parents today, was enjoyable during as we had other friends of the family there as well and mom tends to try her hardest to behave in company, but as soon as they left it of course went to shit :').

I've made a fair few posts in this sub about it previously, but for a spot of context I'll go over the backstory real quick.

At the end of February / beginning of March I caught covid and I ended up getting so sick it triggered an epileptic seizure while I was standing at the top of the stairs, causing me to tumble down. I live by myself and neighbours found me. Got taken away by ambulance to the nearest hospital were I spent 2 days in a coma on the ICU and then woke up again, went home 2 days after that and outside of burnout (had this before the whole ordeal as well) I'm doing fine again. 

Now tonight she kept hammering on about how the police showed up at their doorstep to tell them what had happened and at the time police didn't fully know if I was stable yet, so they told my parents that and my parents were obviously devastated. Doesn't take much of a genius to figure out how that would affect someone.

But they kept hammering on and on and on about it tonight and they kept making it sound like I was at fault for it all. Like yeah of course ma, I 100% purposefully decided to just put myself in a coma for a couple of days so I could have a nice sleep in.

What they ended up saying though is that they are still suffering from this and they still wake up with it some nights. But the blame towards me comes from the fact that I went LC with them shortly after I got home.

Now I went LC because shortly after I had to, of course, process what had happened to me as well and it led me down a rabbit hole of my mental health (which was already terrible) and that's when I found this sub and figured out just how abusive mom's BPD had been over the years and I needed the time to let that sink in, so I went LC.

Apparently though, you're not allowed to do such things. Because we are family and we go through things together and I might not like it that we're family and I might not want to be family anymore but I don't have a choice because I am and if were to even try she'd drag me back into the family by my hair screaming if she had to, she wouldn't allow me to leave the family. Because family sticks together. 

Yeah ma, family does stick together, but family also doesn't abuse each other. Family cares for each other, family doesn't let other family walk on egg shells, family doesn't gaslight each other and lastly, family let's you walk away if you want to.

Just be sure we're blood doesn't mean we're family. We're blood. She can certainly try dragging me back, but I'm going to live my life the way I want to, and that doesn't include abuse. I'm worth more than that.

TW: Mention of rape 

So I guess this is a follow up from [the post I did the other day](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbyborderlines/comments/vv0ly7/i_am_not_borderline/) and besides that...I don't think I even know where to start. Let's go for a quick version and some context first I suppose? 

Been LC for about 4 months (or ever since I found this sub and found out how much trauma mom has caused me), but went shopping with mom on Saturday to our equivalent of Costco. Went to a McDonalds for lunch and ended up telling her about the struggles of getting into therapy for my depression / burnout and trauma and getting a diagnosis for Autism. Mom has been vehemently against me ""putting the label of autism on myself"". Told her on Saturday that I figured out that I am definitely autistic and that I know for sure, but I don't have a diagnosis yet and I do want one just so I can stop the people going ""oh but you self diagnosed and thus it's invalid"". Everything seemed fine and she agreed that it was shitty of people to do that so it made sense. 

Cut to Sunday. She texts me in the morning that I need to look up HSP and that I'm so stuck on being autistic. She basically said: ""You're not autistic, you're HSP"". Thus invalidating my feelings and self-diagnosis, doing exactly what she said was shitty to do. So I told her that I'm stuck on being autistic because I AM autistic. I told her that I might be HSP as well, I don't know, that's something to figure out with a diagnosis, but I'm 100% certain that I'm autistic and HSP would be co-morbid in that case. 

Which got a reply of ""okay go figure it out then good luck. You'll never get rid of labels"". I answered again saying that I don't need to get rid of the autism label because I'm proud to be autistic. It explains a lot of things about me and it means I've finally found a community that I belong in, a community that I understand and a community that understand me. That I no longer have to mask, that I no longer have to be what society tells me to be to and that I can finally get to know myself and learn who I am and just be that. 

And of course the pwBPD can't have the focus being on someone else, so her reply was ""I, of all people, understand what it feels like to want to belong, but I don't have parents that love me, you do, as if you don't belong with us. You've never done anything other than hurt me but I still love you always"". \*insert wut face here\*. But it gets better. A quick follow up comes  in the form of ""Now I'm crying again because of you, as I so often do. But that's okay, we're not good enough anyways. Glad you found a place to call home, hope they're willing to BBQ with you because I don't want to anymore \[editor note: we were planning a bbq on upcoming Saturday\]. Maybe they're also willing to celebrate Christmas with you"". 

Honestly? Celebrating Christmas with people that accept me and don't go fucking ballistic because dad had a breakfast sandwich and now can't eat as much of the overkill turkey dinner that is served for lunch as they were expecting? Yeah that sounds amazing. I'll take that. 

And still it gets better. This morning I got a whole essay at like 6AM. She knows I hate waking up to those, but she keeps doing it anyways. I think it's on purpose. It tends to ruin entire days for me as whatever happens during my waking up period sets the tone of the day for me. I won't translate and post the whole thing because it's like 1.5x the size of this post so far. But I'll TL;DR it. 

She starts off with a good ol' fashioned ""there's so much I want to say to you"" (and oh boy did she). It then goes into a ""no matter what handicap you have, we still love you. We don't care if you're autistic or not"". Well that's a lie. You do. A lot. But it gets better. She says that it's fine that I'm depressed and ""have trauma, as you say"", sorry what? ""as I say""? That sounds an awful lot like doubting if I have trauma. When she knows full well I was bullied in my entire school going life for being different. Not to mention the trauma from growing up with a pwBPD, but we'll get back to that in a bit. 

However that's about the extent of any focus on me or my feelings. The turn is as close to 180 as one can get as she goes ""Why don't you allow us into your life?"" which is followed up by a whole section of ""because you think I have borderline? Well I don't have borderline! I have untreated PTSD, not that you'll believe me, but what I've had happen to me in my life....even therapists wouldn't be able to handle that. I've been beaten, mentally abused and raped."" and she goes on to go into some more detail about how she beaten, abused and raped. She does also manage to find some room in there somewhere to throw out a casual ""Don't you ever call me borderline again, or else..."". 

The last bit of the main part of the message is about me leaving them and not wanting to be with them and throwing them away even though they love me and get ignored. They being intended as ""mom and dad"" but actually meaning ""mom"" in this case (of course). 

The last paragraph starts off with an absolute banger: ""And then I'll tell you something about your trauma"". Oh this'll be good. She basically goes into my accident at the beginning of march where I had an epileptic seizure that landed me in a 2 day coma in the ICU and how they thought they had lost me and how badly that affected them and how they thought they lost me, but then didn't but now they lost me anyways even though I'm still alive and how it hurts her so much. 

That's pretty much the entirety of the last 10 messages in WhatsApp. It's absolutely mental and it's so self-centered. Me saying I found a place I belong in somehow gets translated into ""I don't care about you anymore, go away"". My trauma gets invalidated out the wazoo and arguably the worst of all is the fact that my autism doesn't get accepted. I get a ""we still love you even though..."". But it's not an acceptance of my autism and I take that personal, because it is. Autism \*is\* me. If I weren't autistic I wouldn't be who I am. I would be an entirely different person. So to get this subtle, under the table disdain for wanting the official label for something I already know I am hurts. A lot. 

And of course the trauma invalidation is a big one as well. I still don't know why she thinks that a dick measuring contest about who has the biggest trauma is needed and why her trauma (which I fully accept btw, I know she's had a traumatic life) means my trauma is not valid somehow. One does not exclude the other and yet here I am, left wondering why this person that's supposed to be the adult in this dynamic gets so petty over this. 

I want to respond. I started writing a response, but I'm not sure I like what I have so far. She denies her BPD and in my message I make a big point that she can deny it all she wants, she has the official diagnosis, it was never disproven and she shows all the symptoms (and ""not being able to make appointments and follow through"" is not the symptom that defines BPD mom :/) but I do also mention that if she wants to deny it, then fine, I'll not tell her she has BPD, I'll leave her to whatever feelings she thinks valid, but that it doesn't take away my trauma nor does it invalidate it. 

Ironically, there is so much I want to say, there's so many feelings of sadness, anger and pain swirling around inside, but I can't translate them into the words needed to convey them properly, which is, also ironically, an autistic trait. 

I wish I was already in therapy so I had an emotional / mental support professional to fall back on and help me with all of this. But unfortunately it looks like I'm still a ways away and all of this confrontation is happening a lot earlier than I had planned for. Kinda wishing I didn't tell her about my mental health struggles now. 

Hey. If you made it this far, congrats and thank you for reading the entire post. I hope you're having a bit of a better day than I am currently, but if you're also not doing too great, please just know that no feeling is final, good times are ahead, you will feel better. No matter what anyone says, your feelings are valid and you matter.

So I asked her about her diagnosis and she says ""yes, but it's a bad diagnosis"", which of course explains fully why her tone of voice flipped from happy go lucky to threatening and pissed off in an instant.

She also kept insisting that people with borderline are ""untrustworthy"", they ""keep lying and what not"" and also that ""you can't make any agreements or appointments with them"".

To be honest, now that I know and realize what she is, how she works, how it impacts me and how I can deal with it, I can't help but just be amused by her empty words and denial.

Almost feels like I'm keeping a journal or writing a novel here. Apologies if it's overbearing at all. TL;DR recap: BPD Mom is horrible at finances and now owes me 1500 euro that I asked back and it's been a hell of a ride so far. 

So, after the whole debacle of mom blocking me on WhatsApp after asking her about the money and her unblocking me the next morning and telling me when they were going to the camp site (on the 26th) I kept quiet. I had no energy to deal with her BS and I said nothing. Yesterday (1st of July) she texted me that they were going to the camping grounds again and I kept quiet again. Still wasn't able to deal with it and today (2nd of July) she actually texted me that they're selling the cabin they have on the camp site to the new site owners and that they're going back home, but more importantly she said that I'll be getting my money back, not sure when exactly, she hopes next week, but just so I know. 

Victory! 

Apparently my lack of energy to respond has persuaded them to sell. So I did text her back saying ""okidokey"". 

Now I do have to apply some brakes here because this can definitely be a manipulation tactic to get me to respond. But so far she hasn't responded to my okidokey and she can try to dangle the carrot in front of me with ""it'll be in 2 days"" \*2 days pass\* ""it got moved to wednesday"" \*wednesday rolls around\* ""It's tomorrow"" type of BS. But I came prepped: We'll go right back to the silent treatment until the money is in my account. At the end of the day it's a win-win for me. I don't have to deal with the BS and I get my money back. 

The flipside however would be that if I get the money back she's gonna expect to go back to more contact and generally I'll be fine with that. But I can't deal with BS right now so I'll probably keep LC going for as long as possible.

This will not be the last time any of this type of stuff happens. But I'm happy knowing that they're now at least selling the cabin and they're getting some money so they can pay me back and then do whatever they want with the rest of it (hopefully save it or spend it where it matters, like bills etc, but I doubt it).",1,12,12,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='v34803')>,,/r/raisedbyborderlines/comments/v34803/bad_financial_decisions_part_3_victory/,,,False

Do we think there might be some sort of correlation between ""cat people"" and Autism? 

Now here me out on this. Like any good research study let's set some parameters here. Cats are often labeled as autistic (or at least show autistic traits). Dogs are often not labelled as such. Now the second parameter is people. There seems to be some sort of bias from almost anyone who likes pets towards either cats or towards dogs. Of course people can love both or love other animals too. But if you put a dog and a cat in front of them they tend to bond more with one over the other. 

Now with those parameters set in place, is there any sort of logical conclusion we might be able to take away between people who naturally bond more with cats than dogs (cat people) and being diagnosed as autistic? 

Of course I do realize that one does not exclude the other and there's dog people that are autistic or people who can't deal with either who are autistic, so it's nothing fool proof here, but would it be possible that the percentage of cat loving people who are autistic is statistically significantly higher than dog loving people who are autistic?

It's kinda nice actually, even though there's nothing she can actually do to help me as she's not trained to deal with ANY of the BS I'm throwing her way (dDPD mom + Burnout + possible autism + possible CPTSD + a whole litany of other things all intertwining). 

Today we had another quick half an hour appointment and while walking I told her about my mom flipping out to me and [blocking me](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbyborderlines/comments/uv8897/bad_financial_decisions/) [on WhatsApp](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbyborderlines/comments/uy397l/bad_financial_decisions_part_2_the_reconnect/) (2 links to earlier posts on RBB with context). But instead of telling her I just handed her my phone and told her to read through it. Her first response was basically ""Oh wow....errmmm"". 

It was a greatly entertaining for me to see her reaction and see what she thought of it. I feel like it took her a solid 10 minutes to process what she had read and eventually she came to the conclusion that going that what I've been doing sounds like it's probably the best way to deal with this (going vLC). She said that because of the amount of other stuff on my plate this was probably my best bet to keep on doing and focus on myself and I'm not gonna lie, it felt great to get some outside validation for the BS that we as RBBers deal with from ""normal"" people. 

That's about all I've got on my side, hope you're all doing well and holding out strong. Life with pwBPD can be awful sometimes but know that some stranger on the internet thinks you're incredibly strong for dealing and managing with it as you turn into a much stronger person you would've otherwise been.

So I figured I'd update y'all whenever my mom contacted me again after she blocked me earlier in the week and now is this time. Well technically she had already unblocked me the very next morning but she hasn't said anything since then. Probably didn't know where to pick back up from the last words being ""I'm blocking you"". But I figured that I wasn't going to be the one to start the conversation back up, I'd leave that up to her. Let her go over that difficult bump.

Well this morning is the morning she's managed that and it's short and sweet: ""the car is already fixed and we're going back to the campgrounds so you know"". Nothing too special or surprising really. I'm tempted to send back something along the lines of ""and what about my money? Haven't gotten that back yet have I?"" but I suspect that'll get me another blockage so I'm not sure about that yet.

However what I AM strongly considering is driving over to their house later today and ""breaking in"" (not really breaking in if I have the keys is it) and grabbing my spare house key and car keys back, locking the door behind me and dropping their keys through the mail slot.

That would atleast get me my keys back and get me into a more comfortable position for going NC. Now I do have a slight concern that they might have my house keys on them, in which case it'd be useless, but I dunno, worth a shot perhaps?

Told them to speak to a family friend who we always bring our cars to, not an official licensed dealer but does repair and sell cars for a living.

Got a text this morning that he can do it much cheaper. Great, problem solved right? Saved money now she can set that aside and pay me back the 1500 euro she owes me. Nope, instead she went ""ya know, I'm gonna buy a TV for in the vacation home and an Amazon firestick and pay for an Amazon UK account so I can watch British iTV. could also do it with an iPhone but we don't have those"".

Excuse my language but WHAT THE FUCK? you can't afford 1000 euro to repair your car, but you can afford a new TV (sure couple hundred euros would suffice, but still), buy a fire stick (80 euro ish?) and a prime sub (which we already have btw, just not for the UK site) and then you still can't watch iTV because THAT'S NOT HOW THAT WORKS!

I've told her before I'm working on setting something up, but it's taking a while due to my mental health and reliance on a third party that's not hurrying up. But she keeps ignoring it and instead of paying me back my 1500 euro that I'm gonna be needing soon to buy a garden, she wants to buy stuff for their vacation home.

Oh and as I type this I get spammed back messages, firstly her telling me that that _is_ how it works (it doesn't, I'm in IT, I like to think I know more about IT as a professional than she does). And it's followed by:

""Yeah alright""
""Great""
""Lovely""
""How often have I asked you to pay me back something? It's already stressful enough. You're such a twat, fuck off, I have enough stress without you, stupid kid""
""don't want to hear you again""
""I'm gonna block you""

And she's now blocked me. Guess that's my NC sorted then. And I'm guessing I can say goodbye to that 1500 euro.

Well I say that but in 2 days time at most she'll have unblocked me and she'll be talking to me again.

3249,yes,AutisticAdults,2022-05-18 09:51:42,bwssoldya,Losing special interests?,"Hi all,

I have a bit of a question for those who have lived the bigger part of their life undiagnosed. No idea if this is something normal or if this is something that'll go away or what ever. 

I've been an avid gamer since the age of 7 and am now 30. As a wee-gamer an during my teen years I was absolutely obsessed with gaming, to the point of missing toilet breaks, not drinking enough, the whole 9 yards. In hindsight this was of course a special interest. 

To this day I still love gaming and games. I still keep up with the news on a daily basis and I get incredibly hyped for the big gaming summer press-conferences every year. But what I've noticed is that gaming it self just doesn't give me the same...I dunno, obsession?...that it used to. It's like I can no longer lose myself in playing games and enjoying them and I'm not 100% sure why that is. I do have a few theories though:

I suspect one of the bigger reasons is the constant complaining from my mom that I spend too much time behind the PC playing video games and I should do something useful with my life. This started somewhere during my teens. I've managed to mostly ignore it, but the older I get and the more she keeps saying it the less time I spend behind the PC or the less time I spend gaming. It almost feels like my mom bullied me out of one of my special interests. 

Other explanations are that it might be something natural. It just happens that over time you lose interest in your special interest. Though I find that a bit hard to believe with how autism and it's special interests seem to work. ""life gets in the way"" is the other explanation I can picture being a part of the reason. As an adult there's more responsibilities on you like taking care of your house, caring for pets and / or kids (latter n/a in this particular case), etc. Ya know, ""adult things"". 

If I think through that last explanation though, I end up coming to the conclusion that that would mean that my masking killed my special interest and that would be pretty much the same thing as the first reason I mentioned. It'd mean that to appease NT's I've ruined a special interest for myself. That makes me incredibly sad and furious. 

It also has the side effect of feeling like my current horrible mental state might be stemming from the fact I can't execute my special interest, or at least not without a constant voice in the back of my head going ""you're a 30 year old that is playing games during the weekend? You have a house to maintain and clean. Go clean your house, go do something useful with your life"". 

My horrible mental state is the fourth and final potential reason I can think of for gaming less and less. Currently undiagnosed, but I know for a fact I have severe trauma from bullying as a child and recently I came to the realization that my mom, with her Borderline Personality Disorder is probably responsible for more severe trauma to a point where I'm showing symptoms of cPTSD and I estimate there's a good chance of getting that diagnosis once I do get into therapy (a waiting game atm). 

Is this loss of a special interest something any of you can relate to? Have you ""lost"" a special interest due to societal pressure? If so, can it come back fully or will it never be the same? Is there any explanation I might've overlooked? What are your opinions on the reasons I gave? 

Sorry if that's a lot, don't mean to overwhelm anyone, but I'm just freestyling this and typing as it comes out and apparently it comes out in a quite overwhelming fashion. Thank you if you made it this far in the post. Just wanted to mention that no matter what you're going through, you're still a person and you are worthy of being loved and cared for.",30,17,17,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='us98or')>,,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/us98or/losing_special_interests/,,,False

So, bit of a story here, but I'll condense it down for you.

This happened this afternoon. I was in the backseat of my parents' car and they were driving me home. We're almost there and mom goes ""so, you want us to drop you off, or do you want to talk about it all"" (""it all"" being my epilepsy diagnosis we just got back from). But she says it in a way where you can't help but feel like the only ""correct answer"" is the second option.

So my response is ""no, what you're actually asking is 'can we come inside and talk about it all because I'm wanting to talk about it'."" and she instantly blew up at me 😂. Was actually entertaining to watch (given we were literally around the corner from my house so I wasn't gonna get any long lasting rants). She flipped out and started shouting ""don't you put words in my mouth! I didn't say that, this is about you!"". Ended up rolling my eyes and said ""well in that case I'm good"". Wasn't about to be subject to more of this b/s than that.

If she can't even respond back to me in a normal tone of voice at a normal speaking volume, then I'm all good....well, that makes it sound like I'm not good about my diagnosis, but I am so the answer would've been the same either way.

Anyways, tl;dr: pwBPD can't handle being faced with their manipulative behaviors. Who knew.

Also just to quickly go over it in case anyone is left wondering. Had an epileptic seizure couple of months ago, probably caused by covid. Had MRI and EEG done and we just got the news that it was in fact epilepsy, but that the scans all look good and we're hoping it won't happen again.

UPDATE: so it's the next day and I've been expecting a message from mom about yesterday and her getting her need to talk in anyways and sure enough, 9:30am I get a whatsapp 😂. So predictable.

And of course the contents are just as predictable. TL;DR: ""how are you after yesterday, did the doctor say anything that scared you? Anyways about me. *the other 95% of the message is about how she feels and what she thinks about whether or not I should be taking anti epilepsy medication*""

3251,yes,AutisticAdults,2022-05-08 10:37:15,bwssoldya,Special interests,"Hey y'all,

Apologies if this has been asked before and apologies if this would've been better in the introduction thread (chose a seperate post because it's more of a specific topic). 

Not officially diagnosed (yet) but I'm sure I'm autistic, just have to wait until I can get into therapy and get to do the tests.

So my question is about special interests. The more I read the more I'm not sure about special interests. I do have interests that have been with me for decades now like anything IT related and stuff like gaming, but my other interests that I end up hyper focusing on tend to be things that I hyper focus on for a small period of time and it recurs every year. So for example, in November / December / January I'll absolutely binge and be obsessed with TV shows and movies, but then it fades away and then come January, March I might return into Minecraft for example or I'll get obsessed with 3d printing and it'll last for a month, two, maybe three at most. Then I'll be fed up with them and I'll not touch it for a year when I get some sort of trigger again and I end up obsessing over it again for a few months. 

Are those still special interests? Is that normal on autism? Or is this more along the lines of how NT's work? Reading and watching and listening to a lot of stuff about special interests I hear a lot about people being obsessed with things for much much longer than I tend to be. Hence my insecurity.

I have a feeling my obsessions might be that short because I have a job and a lot of other obligations that get in the way of my obsessions. Or perhaps it's an obsession I just can't do anything with right then and there (woodworking obsession and wanting to get into it but not having wood to work on for example)

But I need to vent and get it out before I respond to my dBPD mom because I doubt this'll be fine otherwise. Also, this post is about issues dealing with finances, I'm personally very open and honest about finances and I know that not everyone likes that, so this is your forewarning that I will discuss finances and I will be using fairly specific numbers in this post. And another big warning is that I am currently fairly angry and I tend to cuss a lot when I'm angry so there might be some swear words here and there. Apologies to the mods, if there's boundaries there that I've crossed please reach out, I'd be happy to rectify the post. That should cover the warnings ahead of time now time. 

My dBPD mom is the person in their household who does the money and she's absolutely godawful at it. She knows how to do it, her advice is actually relatively good, but she straight up just doesn't follow it. As long as I can remember we've been in some form of financial trouble. She's a stay at home mom by choice (more like unemployable because she can ""never work under a boss"" and hold a job longer than 2 weeks is more like it but I digress). My dad is now retired but used to work as fork lift mechanic. Not the greatest pay but should be able to keep a family of 3 people and a few pets sorted out. However due to the poor management of the finances we were always struggling for money and have been fairly close to the brink of bankruptcy.

These financial troubles of course mean that monkey see, monkey do and adult me sucks with money as well , but having been on the brink of bankruptcy myself and just barely being able to escape it and get back on track and having had a lucky break last year I've come to be very aware of just how bad financial stress feels and I've vowed ""never again"".

Now my parents had a lucky break as well last year. See, my fathers sister is a very wealthy woman (through marriage) with millions and millions in the bank and being well off like she is, she's also very stingy with her money (absolutely her right not hating, just painting a picture) and she's getting older (in her 70's) and she's been trying to distribute her wealth among family last year. She'd rather give with a warm hand than a dead one (her words). So she's been gifting all my dad's siblings a bunch of money. In total over the past year my parents received 160,000 euro from her. For a spot of context, they live in a house that is mortgaged for that amount of money.

Now this was in 4 installments, 3x 50k and in January another 10k. My mom has managed to burn through 160k euro in a year's time to remodel the house (ie: start like 5 remodeling projects and not finish them because of course contractors are too expensive, gotta do it all on our own) leaving them with a new wood laminated floor (they also bought ceramic tiles to redo the floor, but those live in the new outside shed that's barely water tight and missing doors) they added a glass room to the back of the house that leaks, gets way too warm in the summer because it doesn't have shades, leaks, etc, had new stairs put into the house that are now destroyed by a cheap ass contractor literally dragging a window up them for double glazing upstairs, etc etc etc. You get the point. Individually all of this sounds great, but each and every single one of those projects was done half baked and there's a few I haven't even mentioned yet.

Now all that in mind, they've run out of money again. They have a chalet on a holiday resort Park type deal they are trying to sell but no one wants it. Now what does a good BPD mother do when she had no money and keeps mishandling her money? She asks her son of course! Nevermind that he's going through severe mental health struggles and is dealing with a lot right now. Let's just pile on more shit that is not inheritly his problem! Yay!

I mentioned that I too got lucky last year financially speaking. It's a whole situation but suffice to say I got a new house and took out a new mortgage that left me with 55k to spend on interior (excluding bathroom, kitchen etc) and stuff like garden. I've bought a lot, a full new interior and splurged on a lot. Leaving me with around 7k in the bank account and another 800-1200 euro in crypto (depending on the day). This 7 grand is planned for the driveway and garden remodel. I'm not sure how expensive it is going to be, still awaiting the a quote. Mom knows this. And last month she already asked me for a 1000 euro. Now they've helped me out in the past as well (always accompanied with angry 'get your finances straight' rants etc which is fair) so I gave her the 1000 euro. And in early January she had already asked for 3 grand and she's paid that back when she got the other donation from my aunt. All well and good. But this morning she's asked me for another 500 euro.

This leaves me with around 5k on the account (had some other big medical bills come in as well) and I'm still not sure what the garden is gonna cost, but I bet it's more than 5k.

Either way I'm willing to give it to her but it's the way she asks. And the fact that she asks in the first place tbh. From what I've heard it's not normal for parents to ask their children for financial support. But what pisses me off about it is the way she asks. She does this thing where she texts me at like 5am when I'm still asleep (she is always up waay early) and thus what happens is that I wake up and first thing I see is a text asking for money, sending my undiagnosed autistic brain into a frenzy and effectively ruining my day because I get mad and that's what my brain does.

And she does this every. Single. Time. And it pisses me off like you wouldn't believe. But oh boy, if I even dare to get remotely pissy at her for miss managing 160,000 euro or giving her a speech about how she needs to get better with her money or even how it ruins my day that she asks. I'm gonna get the full brunt of BPD. Screaming, shouting, guilt tripping, gaslighting, you name it.

I've not transferred the money yet and I haven't responded yet, because I wanted to get this off my chest first. It's helped calm me down a little bit, but it still gets me fuming and you can bet that this day is gonna be a shit one for me.

I'm sorry for the incredibly long post, but I thank you for having this place that I feel safe enough to post this tirade. It means a lot to be able to vent.

I do hope your day is better and whatever you are dealing with, remember that no feeling is final and a day will come where the sun once again shines bright.

3255,yes,raisedbyborderlines,2022-05-03 16:28:15,bwssoldya,Trauma bonding,"So in a post in here earlier today by someone else someone linked a video to Dr. Ramani about Trauma Bonding. Being curious as I am and not knowing what that was I ended up watching it, fantastic watch, thank you for linking the video (apologies, I forgot who it was) ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmB9fpHVd2o) for reference)

It's sent me on a bit of a rollercoaster, not necessarily about my self. I do recognize trauma bonding in there and I do recognize that the last relationship I was in was with a pwBPD and it was based on trauma bonding (now that I know what it is) and I realized I saw some friends go through the same thing as well. 

But no, my main concern in this is my dad. I do recognize some of the signs in his behaviour going back a few years and it's made me a bit sad to be honest. Mostly due to the fact that he's 69 now, getting up there in age and the only way he'd ever get out is by going into therapy. Being Dutch, from a farmer family and born in the 50's he's too stubborn to even remotely consider it so I doubt it'll ever happen, which is what makes me sad. The thought of having to eventually lose my dad (which is something I do struggle with, but putting that aside) and him having not had the same....I want to say chance, but he has had the chance...but therapy and stuff was different back when he had the chance I'd say....either way, inner dilemma aside, it pains me that he's going to have to probably spend the rest of his life enduring this abuse (or in the very rare case of him escaping, being alone) and not ever being able to find out what healthy relationships look like. It's such a sad thought. And yeah, I know, don't ever assume things (ass out of u and me, and all that) and I'm not saying there's 0 chance. But I think odds are better of him winning the lottery than him seeking out therapy, so.... 

However, mentioning therapy also brings up a very recent memory of mine that I've been struggling a bit with. Something my mom said recently. Before I get into that though, a spot of context is needed. 

At the beginning of March (2nd) I was very ill and I ended up tumbling down the stairs with a seizure (temp diagnosis is Epilepsy, still awaiting results if it actually is or not) and ended up being found by my neighbours and being rushed to the hospital where I was also found to have COVID (I'm 30yo male with obesity and a history of various lung problems among which bronchitis and asthma, all that being a very bad combo). Ended up in a coma the ICU for a solid day and 2 days after was declared healthy enough to be released back home. This however triggered a whole thing about possible mental trauma for having gone through all of that suddenly. Both from my parents but also from my GP. He recommended I go see a psychiatrist (got the referral yesterday) and possibly even undergo EMDR therapy depending on how bad it gets. 

Here's the bit you're here for:  
However, I also told my parents that I think they should undergo therapy as well due to this not only being a (potential) traumatic experience for me, but also for them. The response I got from mom however is what has puzzled me ever since and I think Dr. Ramani might've just helped me figure this out. Her exact words were ""No, we're not going to therapy. If we go to therapy my marriage is over"". 

Up until now I haven't been able to place why this was exactly. Yeah they have fallouts (geez who would've guess there'd be loads of arguments in a household with BPD?) etc and their marriage has been rocky ever since ""the flat incident"" (more about this later) so I get it from that point, but I couldn't figure out why therapy would be the bit to break that relationship up. But it's not therapy it self that would do it, it's specifically my dad going into therapy that would push him into realizing what was going on and then yeah I can definitely see the marriage break up. That makes sense now. So, again, to the person who posted that link, thank you! 

So quickly about ""the flat incident"". Back when we lived in a flat for a while (talking like \~15 years ago now?), mom fell in love with the superintendent of the flat and they were gonna be together and she'd divorce dad and the intendent would divorce his wife, etc. And yes, their were pretty much cheating on their partners because they were already in a sort of relationship together while still being with their partners. This might well be the most traumatic event I've been through that I can recall and I can't really think about it all that much without becoming overwhelmed with all the emotions and I can't place them. They ended up reconciling with their partners at the behest of the superintendent's partner and mom and dad stayed together but we moved out of the flat a while later, so I don't know what happened to the superintendent. Either way, mom and dad's marriage has never been the same since and it feels like the BPD and it's effects have grown worse over time as a result. 

Also, that flat incident is where I'm getting my main confirmation for ""dad is involved with trauma bonding"" from. During that whole incident both parents used me as their defacto therapist and oh boy, lemme tell ya. Seeing your dad literally bawl his eyes out uncontrollably in front of you does something to your soul. But the main bit that sticks out is that even though ALL of that was going on, I vividly remember him shouting about my mom to me. I don't remember the exact words but it boiled down to something along the lines of ""she's the one for me, she's the love of my life, If I can't have her my life is useless and I might as well end it then"" (perhaps not entirely that suicidal, but it wasn't far off). Thinking back on that, it definitely matches what Dr. Ramani talked about in that video. 

Sorry for the long rant. This just triggered something and I felt like posting it. If you've read this far, thank you, I appreciate you and whatever you're going through, know there's going to be a better tomorrow. The sun will rise again, it's science, they proved it, and life will go on, so take a deep breath and keep on keeping on.

3259,yes,raisedbyborderlines,2022-04-28 10:31:43,bwssoldya,Contact is hard after the initial realization,"Hey Y'all, 

So, having realized just Tuesday that being RBB has a serious mental impact and is a *big* part of being as mentally scuffed as I am, I've now ended up in a situation that I find myself struggling with. 

I've not told anyone (except my social worker) about the situation and I plan to keep it that way. People around me know I've had a bit of a mental breakdown Tuesday and I've told them I'd explain more once I finally get connected with a psychiatrist (which is taking longer than I had hoped). 

I feel this need to talk about this sort of thing over with the psychiatrist first because even though the feelings and realization are there, I feel like I need some validation from a professional about the situation and for them to tell me that ""yes, you are right, your issues do seem to stem from mental abuse from a pwBPD"" before I go around telling the people around me. If I don't it feels like I'll be drawing conclusions without an actual basis for it somehow. 

However, internally I am already feeling like the flood gates have cracked and slowly but surely stuff is seeping out, among which is the standard blame towards my mom. I know those feelings are valid (if I am right about the abuse) and I'm allowed to feel them, but here's the issue: I'm still in contact with my parents and the contact has always been fairly regularly. Some weeks we barely talk but most weeks it's atleast a few whatsapp message per day back and forth. But feeling this blame and this resentment makes this contact *extremely* difficult. 

Out of all the people to tell about this, my parents are probably last on the list (because of obvious reasons). But I think the psychiatrist might be weeks if not a few months away (waiting lists etc) and I'm not sure I can hold back the floods that long, let alone mask those feelings of resentment and blame. 

Is there any advice you guys, gals and others might have that will make it easier to keep up appearances while I await the psychiatrist? 

Thank you in advance. 

P.S. Also have another kitty pic just because

3260,yes,raisedbyborderlines,2022-04-26 14:00:17,bwssoldya,quick introduction and some questions about being RBB,"Hey y'all,

Just found this community today and you made me realize that I am RBB as well. I was so oblivious to it all that I never knew. So, thank you all so much for giving me such an epiphany.

Wanted to give a quick intro about me and my situation and had some questions after the wild mental and emotional morning I've had today.

So real quick, 30M over in Europe, grew up with a diagnosed BPD mother (of the ""witch"" type) and a father that also couldn't (and still can't) handle it. I'm not sure if he's an enabler or not, I've not had the time to analyse this yet.

Currently looking into this sort of thing due to recently falling down the stairs with a seizure and waking up in the ICU (currently still awaiting tests for more info) and due to the fact that this was such a traumatic event I'm currently seeing a social worker whilst I await my doctor's forward to a psychiatrist for (EMDR) therapy. Poking and prodding into my mental state (which, as you've all also experienced is v. bad) led me down the rabbit hole and eventually (via another community on reddit) I ended up here.

So, enough about me, I mentioned I had some questions, would appreciate it greatly if I could take up some more of your time and ask these (and hopefully get an answer?). The initial questions that spring to mind are:

1. How can I recognize who is enabling my mother, other than people's acting like flying monkies or confronting them with the diagnosis? Is there a way to find out what the enablement looks like without letting anyone know I'm looking into this sort of thing? I really don't want to do a confrontation or anything yet until I am in therapy and I know I'll have a stable net to fall back onto when stuff eventually blows up.

2. I've always held a believe of me being on the spectrum for Autistic and as a part of my request for therapy and this journey of uncovering the mountains of bad mental issues, I've requested an official test for a diagnosis of ASD, that being said I've also been diving into ASD and out of all the points in DSM5 that are associated with ASD I'm checking a good 80% I feel like, so I'm almost certain I'm somewhere on the spectrum atleast. Now my actual question is not a diagnosis or anything, but I'm curious to know if there are any others in here that have ASD (diagnosed or undiagnosed) that have gone through RBB and if they'd be willing to share some of their experiences. 

3. I see a lot of talk about LC and NC situations. I get that removing oneself from the situation is definitely a solution, but is there some sort of solution whereby there is still a lot of contact, but where it's more manageable as you're not in _constant_ contact? Given that one of the main issues in BPD is abandonment issues, wouldn't NC or LC be the worst thing imaginable for the BPD person and only help to trigger more issues towards you? And for me personally, I do love my parents and even though I'm now starting to see how growing up with them messed me up worse than I thought, I don't really want to lose contact with them and I don't really want to hurt them. 
	
Like I said, new here and don't want to mess anything up, so please do let me know if this post isn't appropriate or anything. If it's really bad I'd be more than happy to delete it and compensate with some cute cat pictures.

Thank you all so much for being here and creating this community. It's helped me open my eyes and I now know what a great starting point for therapy would be.

Thank you.

Hey y'all,

Just started my journey into the halo books, currently deep into the fall of reach and reading through the part right after >!they get their MJOLNIR armour, specifically where Linda and John have to leave Samuel behind!< left me wondering something and I'm curious to pick your brains about it. 

Would Spartan II's ever be able to love? And I don't mean the Spartan's like Fahjad who had to drop out after the augments, I mean the Spartans like John, Kelly, Linda, etc, the ones that actually saw active combat and lived to tell the tale. 

I know the Thyroid implant in their  augment suppresses sexual drive, so I doubt there'd be much HoloFlix & chill going on with any of them, but from a romantic perspective, or heck even a non-romantic perspective, would they be able to love? Given all they were ever taught was friend and foe, I wonder if they would ever be able to love. Side note, I also don't mean ""love"" in the way the Spartan II's all share their special family-esque connection, I mean outside of the Spartan II's. 

And extending out from loving, do we think the Spartans would ever be able to just...live...outside of active service as a civvie? Looking at our real life situation, you're already seeing soldiers who have seen long active duty and deployments seriously struggle with reintegration into society and that's young adults voluntarily signing up for service. I can't imagine how difficult it'd be for a Spartan II.

It's cool that we can do custom rulesets but that's not what I want to play. I want to play traditional Hardcore TDM and I want to know what I'm getting into. I want to know if I'm gonna be able to kill team mates or not, I want to know if I'm gonna have a HUD or not, I want to know if I'm gonna be killed for killing a teammate or not and most importantly, I want to know that I'm gonna be playing the same experience over and over again...against people. 

I get it, Conquest (and now breakthrough) have been **the** battlefield gamemodes since the inception of the series. I get it. But not everyone likes dealing with vehicles or big ass maps all the time. Or perhaps, in the case of air superiority, we specifically *want* to deal with vehicles all the time and not worry about capping objectives. How is it that we can get a whole ton of gamemodes in BF4, some of which are literally already in Portal as well (TDM, FFA) but not get them in the new main 2042  game? 

Give us more options DICE. Even if it's just TDM and FFA for now. I doubt it'll be hard for you to create a TDM and FFA mode for AOW seeing as they are already working in the game. Hardcore for all the AOW modes should be a matter of settings, the same settings we control in portal mind you. And for the other gamemodes like gunmaster, air superiority, domination, ctf, etc. I'd understand if they are a bit more work to implement, that's alright. But that doesn't mean they don't need to be added. I'd be fine if they were added at the beginning of next year. But AOW versions of TDM, FFA and Hardcore should not be that hard to implement given they are already in the game.

**Details**

Top 3 rules set the variables we want to use.  
\- *global* **iSniperLimit** \- *int - default: 5* \- The maximum number of snipers per team  
\- *global* **aSniperWeaponList** \- *array* \-  A list of weapons that are considered ""snipers""   
\- *team* **iSniperCount** \- *int - default: 0* \- The current amount of snipers per team   
\- *player* **bIsSniper** \- *bool - default: false* \- If the current player is a sniper   


Last rule is where the magic happens. It will check on player  deploy if the the player is carrying one of the weapons listed in the *aSniperWeaponList* variable. If they are it'll check if the player is marked as a sniper. If not it will check if the sniper limit has been reached. If it is, the player gets killed and a message gets shown. If the sniper limit has not been reached the player will be marked as a sniper and the current sniper count for that team will be upped by 1. If the player is already marked as a sniper nothing happens. If however the player spawns without a sniper rifle and the player is currently marked as a sniper it will remove the mark from the player and it will decrease the team's sniper count by 1.

3271,yes,battlefield2042,2021-11-10 17:10:00,bwssoldya,Recreated my favorite BF4 server in BC2 Portal (+ small tutorial on the logic editor + tips),"Just wanted to share my first creation in the portal editor. Very quick sort of recreation / homage to one of my favorite BF4 servers at the moment.

[https://review.portal.battlefield.com/experience/rules?playgroundId=44e5c140-4244-11ec-aae1-7b50c6ace776](https://review.portal.battlefield.com/experience/rules?playgroundId=44e5c140-4244-11ec-aae1-7b50c6ace776)

&#x200B;

It's Hardcore Team Deathmatch with BC2 classes on BC2 and BC3 maps with custom logic for a sniper limit. I believe this *should* technically work.....but...hard to test.

So onto the tutorial + tips on the logic editor.

First off the order of things. *Step 1:* You begin with a rule. A rule is basically telling the game when stuff needs to happen. By default it's set to ""Ongoing"" and ""Global"". This means this rule is always doing stuff and it's for everyone.

*Step 2:* Conditions A condition is optional. If you specify it you are telling the rule ""hey, only do the things I tell you IF (or when) this condition is met. Example: ""Only run the actions of this rule if a player spawns with this weapon in their inventory"".

*Step 3:* Actions This is the meat and bones of it all. This is where you do most of the work. There's a lot you can do here, from displaying messages to killing players to....well, whatever really. There's too much to cover, might make some tutorials if people want it?

Next up: Symbology. There's a fair few icons used and imho there's no real documentation on what does what. I've figured a few out so far, I'll list them below. Side note; if a field has multiple icons it means it will accept any of those types.

* A person: A player
* Multiple people: A team ID (note; Not sure if it's just the ID, but I imagine so)
* Two arrows going opposite directions: A boolean (true/false, yes/no, etc)
* Question mark: Null (note; still not sure what all goes in here. I've found that it will accept variables, but the rest I'm still not sure on)
* Infinity symbol: Much like my love live, this will take pretty much anything it can get
* Two opposing square brackets: An array (a list of values, ie; \[""apple"", ""pear"", ""orange""\])
* 123: A number, big surprise
* A rectangle with rounded corners (a USB-C plug?) : Some sort of specific green element. Only really saw this in the message thing and there you can add a CustomMessageSlot.

Hope this helps some of you out a bit. If you found more stuff please let me know, I'm eager to dive into this stuff some more.

3272,yes,Advice,2021-01-19 10:06:47,bwssoldya,Struggling with selfishness versus being there for others,"Hey r/Advice,

I have been dealing with an internal struggle on and off for the past little while already and today it seems to have gotten to a point where I'm ready to ask some advice on the matter. It is the struggle between being a good friend and selfishness.

I have felt like a selfish person (in the bad way) for a while now, dealing with my problems, talking about myself a lot (this issue is here while writing this as well) and laying focus on myself. I've really taken notice of it this last year and I've decided I don't like being selfish. I want to be less selfish and focus more on the people around me. I want to hear them out, I want to help them with their struggles and I want them to be in a place where they enjoy being.

This however goes against the other side of me, the side of me that is hurting, that is in pain and that has helped me survive for the past like 5 years. I have no official diagnosis, but I'm pretty sure I am suffering of some form of depression, given how lazy I have gotten and how I beat myself up, both emotionally and in some ways physically as well (with junk food, taking care of my body etc).

Now that you know the two sides that are at play, I'd love like to explain the situation and go through some of the internal debate that rages within me. A good friend of mine is going through a tough spell in life. They have just broken up with their SO last week and yesterday they had some news that causes them to think their job might not be as secure as they had previously thought.

Over the course of this last week I've been talking to them about their breakup and I've kept on tell them I'm there for them and they need to reach out if they want my help and I've offered to hang out in voice chat with them when they're lonely in the mornings etc, been DMing with them on an almost daily basis to talk them through the rough patches and basically offering my support, trying to tell them everything will be alright and things will be better in the future. This has been going on for a week now and I totally get they are feeling down and in the dumps and life is taking a shit on them right now and I've been there and I know you have too.

However, since yesterday morning I've felt actually fairly happy since a while. Even though there's plenty of nasty dark clouds drifting over towards me as well, but I've not really had a break in the grey clouds that have been the day-to-day of my internal thoughts over the past 5 or so years, so to finally have a glimpse of a blue sky and some sunshine really gave me a good boost.

Today however, with my friend taking a few steps back down their emotional state where they were just last week as well, I am having a serious discussion on both sides of my being. On the one hand I want to be a good friend for them and be there for them,  I want to offer my support to them, I want to reach out to them and do .... I don't actually know what to do, I have no idea what to say or do to help them out, I know the feeling is shit and I've not really conquered it myself, so I don't know what other advice I can give besides ""hey things will be alright"". But I want to be there for them, I want them to not feel as shit as I have, or maybe improve it somehow. On the other hand, that would probably require more voice chat's as well, but I personally don't really enjoy the voice chats that much and on top of that, I'm feeling fairly alright today and yesterday and I don't want to go back to that place myself either, it's been a while since I left that place.

The thing is, this friend hasn't reached out to me today and from where I'm standing, I don't think it likely they will. They haven't asked me to hop into voice, they haven't asked me to DM them asking them to go into more detail on what they are feeling and they haven't asked for my support and part of me is going ""I really don't want to reach out to them again. It's all I've done for the past week or so and I've set aside my dislike for voice chats etc. to be there for them, I've offered to watch their favorite TV show with them, etc., all for them. I myself am feeling quite alright generally speaking and I don't want their 'negativity' (big word, I know they can't help it, but at the end of the day it is negativity) to ruin my day too. My past years have been bad enough by themselves. Let them reach out to me and maybe I'll consider responding, but maybe also not because of the last reason"".

On the other side however, I have this part of me going ""Dude. You offered to be their friend, you have on multiple occasions told them you want to be there for them and you want to help them. You have also decided that you want to try to not be as selfish as you have been and still are and it takes a lot of effort to be selfless, but c'mon, you made promises and you genuinely also want to be there for this person and you can't even be selfless for that. How can you call yourself a good friend if you can't even put your own feelings aside for a friend going through a deep deep valley in their life?""

Which gets answered with a ""yeah, and where was this friend when I was going through these deep valleys huh? Where were they for me?"", which sounds an awful lot like Ego, I do realize that.

To which the other side responds with ""What don't you understand about being selfless? The whole point is that you do it and not expect anything in return. Just because they weren't there for you doesn't mean you can't be there for them. Also you didn't reach out to them either, much like they are not reaching out to you right now and you know how shitty you felt. Maybe instead of letting them go through the same thing you went through you can reach out and they'll have a much easier time than you still have"".

**Question**  
So here finally I have the question for all of you: How do you deal with this sort of internal struggle? How do I make the right choice? Both for my friend and for me if at all possible? This struggle between selfishness (and Ego is on that team here and there as well) and between caring for others is a tough one and I don't know how to make this call, I need some help and I could ask my mother, but it feels like she is biased and I won't be getting the answer on *how* to deal with this and more on what to do in the situation, which doesn't help for any future similar situations.

Any advice or help would be much appreciated and even if you don't want to comment or plan to comment, thank you for reading through it all, it's been a long read and I appreciate it. I hope your day is going well and either way, I hope it only gets better for you.

3275,yes,PathOfExileBuilds,2017-05-15 23:55:39,bwssoldya,[Noob] Confused noob looking for able pro,"Hey /r/pathofexile! 

First off I want to apologize if this is not posted in the correct sub or if I do anything else incorrectly, new to the sub and pretty new to reddit in general, so sorry! 


Alrighty now that I have that out of the way, I, as a new player in Path of Exile have a few questions. I've been looking at PoE for a week or 2 now and playing for a week or so. I've mostly been looking at a few of the bigger YouTubers and their guides on things. I think I've got a fairly rudimentary grasp on most things and I think I sort of maybe know a little bit of what I might be doing, however there's still a lot I don't quite get. 


Now that brings us to reddit and I was hoping that, since there's quite an alive community of PoE-ers here on reddit that you might be able to guide a skrub towards gitting gud. 


So to give you an idea of what I'm playing on: My first character (tried to find a way to link him but I can't find anything on the PoE site?) is a level 57 Shadow in softcore legacy league with the following [passive tree](https://www.pathofexile.com/fullscreen-passive-skill-tree/AAAABAYAAQPuBx4I9A18DdEOSA-rES8Rlha_FvMdviBuIvQkiyY8JpUnqSj6KjgrCi-dM4c2PT1fSVFJsUyzUDBSU1fJXfJh4mNDaoxsC2yMbRltbH_GgseEb5MnlS6XlZf0naqi2bDYtAy1SLzqvorAVMM6yBTK08u91ELXz9te44Tmgeq662PviPDV9W_5N_no). Now this passive tree might seem familiar as I'm basically following the [blade vortex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOwXnAW9NFk) build by LiftingNerd. 


The first thing I'd like your opinion on is whether or not I made a boo-boo in going for a way too complicated build as a complete noob.


In the beginning I absolutely blew through normal and even the first few bits of cruel were no problem at all. Even cruel dominus (phase 2) had no idea what was coming to him (Although phase 1 managed to defeat the might BV at least 3 times thanks to those pesky lightning ghosts >_>). Now however I find myself in Act 4 cruel and I'm just keep on dying. The stronger rare mobs and bosses and basically anything that has anything close to resembling a charge or multiple charges will 1 or 2 shot me. 


My character, with his gear at the moment has 1578 life, 1448 es and a grand total of 71 armor. Resists are 22/17/29 (f/c/l) and chaos res is a sturdy -20%. I know I should probably work on those resists but I just can't seem to find any gear that does the resists well and keeps up plenty of ES so I won't instantly die to literally everything. 


That leads me perfectly into my second question: What can I do at this point in time to...well..fix? my character and not get absolutely melted at Malachi and his minions? 


You can find my current set up [here](http://poe-profile.info/profile/bwssoldya/_bws_Celius). I'd love to hear you guys's thoughts on what I could do to improve my current situation. 


My last question (for now anyways, no promises about the future :P) is: I notice my character often times seems to get...stuck...like he'll just plain refuse to move and especially when casting BV it'll take like half a second after casting for him to start moving which often doesn't help against bosses. Would those be stuns or something else preventing me from moving? (Happens on dried lake and I don't think it's a freeze)


Again my apologies if this sort of thing isn't appropriate here, as I said I'm new to the reddit / POE thing and I don't really know if these things are okay or not (can't find it in the rules). 


Thank you in advance to anyone willing to give me some pointers and helping a skrub git...well better for now.

EDIT: 
Okay so I thought of another question. Sorry >.<. But I was wondering what's the best way to go about the league stones? They're currently filling up my stash and I'm already running low on stash space as is. What do you guys recommend? Keep em till late game or just run them because...well yolo?

3276,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-05-23 06:53:31,Valgrimm93,Identifying triggers for Late Diagnosed/Self-diagnosed Adults,"\*Cross Post\*

 I found out about 8 weeks ago I am likely autistic and have been in burnout essentially ever since. I have noticed that when I am at almost zero energy and am in a safe space, I am often numb and don't feel a whole lot of anxiety or much else. When I do something to recharge some energy however, like go for a walk in a park or partake in my interests (primarily PC gaming), I actually will gain some ambient anxiety to feed off my newly gained energy even when otherwise completely comfortable. For example I was playing a game much of today and felt fine, but as soon as I logged out, I was hit my immediate low grade anxiety, which has been sticking with me ever since.

My guesses as to what might be causing this is:

1. Anticipation of my intake screening appointment with a therapist specializing in autism in about a week, to determine if I should move forward with adult diagnosis. I am feeling fairly sure in my self assessment, especially since hitting burnout and figuring out what was happening, but am frequently imagining what I will say in the appointment even though I really have no idea yet on the format.
2. Stimming. Now that I am aware of my stimming, including some (realistically many) I didn't even know I was doing before I started watching for them, I feel like I perhaps have more conscious control of whether I do them or not. I feel like I am actually doing things I did subconsciously all the time before (rhythmically twitching my fingers, shaking my hands, etc) less since I am more aware of doing them and just don't. I do literally feel a compulsion to do some things when I am not though. Do those aware of their stimming have to do so more consciously?
3. Some unknown irritant I haven't identified yet.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to how to identify what is bothering you when you are having obvious stress from somewhere in a place that otherwise seems safe and relatively trigger free? I am just wondering if anyone has any suggestions for identifying triggers, or if could be due to lack of conscious stimming (or accidental conscious suppression of stimming).

3278,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-05-17 23:50:25,Valgrimm93,Problems with anxiety meds,"I have recently realized I am very  likely autistic and have been doing a ton of research and searching my past to make sense of things.  About 20 years ago, when I was 27,  I had what I now think was likely autistic burnout, but I was undiagnosed and had no idea what was happening to me.  I just lay in my apartment for days trying to figure out why I had no energy to engage anyone socially or really do anything.   I had microdosed weed all day everyday for about 10 years to calm my mind and feel at peace, and suddenly it reversed and increased my anxiety about 10x.  I felt like the world was falling apart on me.

One day, while laying on the sofa, I saw a Zoloft ad on TV which seemed to describe my most obvious symptoms as social anxiety.  I went to the doctor and told him what was happening.   He gave me some Zoloft and referred me to a psychiatrist, who I saw every few weeks for a year or so after that.  I ended up taking Zoloft and Wellbutrin for a few years before I decided I didn't like what they did to me and opted to wean myself off and just sink myself fully into my interests and minimize social interactions outside friends and family instead. 

Fast forward 20 years and my work and just generally increasing social demands are pushing me to my limits again.  Ended up finding out my problem is more likely autism than social anxiety about 8 weeks ago, as well as being in burnout ever since.  One thing I did turn up in this last 8 weeks,  which I had never thought about before, was that I fell out with almost every friend and family member while I was on Zoloft.  Like serious relationship damaging or ending fallout.  I remembered falling out with all of them previously, but not that that all happened when I was on SSRIs. The Zoloft seemed to remove my anxiety, and with it my mask and almost all sense of social tact.  I just said exactly what was on my mind, with no thought as to the consequences.  While removing my fear of conflict, it certainly didn't do anything at all to increase my social ability or desire for interactions.  It was worse if anything else.  

I am having fairly regular anxiety during my current burnout, but would rather be anxious every day than piss off everyone I know again.  Things would have to be pretty dire for me to try SSRIs again.  The slightly scary part is that it seems to be happening, to some extent, even without the meds.  I guess because my battery is always near zero these days,  I have a hard time controlling both my emotions and responses to things that annoy or upset me.  So far, I have kept the most ""unwise"" responses to friends, family,  and co-workers under wraps, but it has been a challenge.

Not sure where I was going with this or even if it makes any sense,  but posting in case someone can relate.",11,7,7,0.89,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13kiavn')>,,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/13kiavn/problems_with_anxiety_meds/,,,False

I have been basically bouncing along through life at almost zero energy since then, while madly researching all I can about autism to try to understand myself and what is going on.  All the things which were stressful and annoying up to this point have become significant problems for me now, as far as social situations and sensory overload.  I have been trying to do my best to relax and recharge as much as possible, but  working in client services, I never seem to gain much before I am drained again.

My work interactions for the last 6 weeks have mostly been by email, Teams chat or phone (ugh, to voicemail those go) so haven't been too hard on me.  Today, I had to have an in person client lunch for the first time since I fully realized my issues.  I was super nauseous and tired on transit to the meeting, keeping my eyes closed, listening to music and trying to sink my attention into random Google feed articles all the way there.   I was grateful our sales person was coming along to carry the conversation. Then I arrived at the restaurant and found our salesperson was 20 minutes late and the client arrived just after I did.

Magically, my nervousness and ill feeling disappeared.  I kept him occupied and managed to steer the conversation to things of interest I could actually talk about.  I felt pretty much just like I always did prior to my burnout while at the lunch with him, minus the sun reminding me of my light sensitivity by blinding me through the clouds while sitting out on the patio.  Granted, I have known the guy in a professional sense for over 10 years and I tend to do better in professional settings, but still.  The changes in me were instant and stark, like I was a different person.  Then, the meeting was over, he left, and I just felt the energy start to drain out of me.  The sales person drove me to the transit station and I slowly regressed back into exactly how I felt before the meeting, except relief that it was past.  Since the meeting, I feel ever increasing exhaustion coming over me and will probably need to sleep early tonight to try and recover.

That was a super weird experience though, since I have never observed myself snapping back and forth between essentially different personalities to fit a situation.  It has always been subconscious and automatic.  Not just putting on a false pretense externally, but more or less being a different person with a different emotional energy level for a short time. No wonder I never had any idea I was doing it before, since it wouldn't have felt like such a massive change from a more normal starting energy level.   Just a weird observation I thought I would share in case anyone can relate.",13,71,71,0.96,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13cfy2y')>,,/r/AutismTranslated/comments/13cfy2y/masking_is_super_weird_once_you_can_observe/,,,False
3280,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-05-08 06:27:47,Valgrimm93,Looking for advice to prep for screening visit with therapist - ADHD traits for possible AuDHD diagnosis,"I am a 47M who has been researching and going through self discovery for \~6 weeks now. I have an appointment with a therapist specializing in autism in a few weeks and am trying to prepare information. I have listed out a lot of autism traits, compared to the DSM and otherwise, but I am intending to tell him I think I may have both autism and inattentive ADHD (currently not professionally diagnosed with either). For ADHD online screening and trait lists seem much less thorough than the adult autism information. Very brief in most cases and half the questions are more related to the hyperactive presentation, which makes sense but don't apply much to me in particular.

I am wondering, for anyone who has been through both autism and ADHD diagnosis, how did you approach the initial screening when you were successful? I would really like to have my information together in case I turn into a semi coherent potato when I am talking with him. Any advice on how to organize the information and the level of the detail for each of the traits for both I should include? Realistically I now have pages and pages of scattered information in 4 different documents arranged in different ways, which won't do.

I have included my notes regarding traits I think are specifically related to ADHD with a brief explanation of each. Please feel free to read and comment, or not. Keeping in mind there is a another larger list I have for autism related traits, except where they cross over. Please let me know if you think if I should exclude any of this or pare it down further for the therapist (it is only a 50 minute screening visit). Any advice is much appreciated.

ADHD Traits

* Generally disorganised. While I find organisation helpful, I often can't motivate myself to organise myself, in relation to planning, general organisation at home and organisation at work. Am very careful where I store important items such as keys, phone and wallet, since I would otherwise likely often lose them.
* Often keep track of things I need to take care of visually. Will often forget to do what I need to do related to physical item (bill, form, note for follow up at work) etc, if it isn’t right in front of me.
* Rely heavily on the calendar on my phone to keep track of appointments. I likely wouldn’t be able to remember most appointments if they aren’t added to my calendar as soon as I have the information.
* Easily distracted. Often I have problems getting started a task again if I get diverted. May never get back to it, even if I want to do so. (Demand avoidance/inertia?)
* Often have problems getting started on tasks that require some thought and organisation to get them started, even if generally easy. Also sometimes have difficulty finalising the last details for a project that is essentially complete.
* Often very difficult to write things down, even when it's relatively important and something I want to do. For example, when developing recipes related to my interests that would be difficult to remember, I often have to use minimal notes or saved web pages to record the most important details in order to be able to decipher and write it down when I have the motivation to do so. For things like grocery list, always try (with varying success) to remember by memory if at all possible.
* Often fidgeting when sitting or otherwise (likely related to stimming, because is more intense when anxious, focused or excited)
* Often make careless mistakes when distracted.
* Very intense and focused interests. Probably cross over with autism since I tend to have long term interests (many years), short term interests (several months to years) and “flash” interests lasting hours or days (very intense short term interests that often drive me to an end goal, such as purchasing an item I am interested in). These interests choose me, rather than I choosing them, and I often can’t ignore them.
* Often lose track of what someone is saying to me and am poor with verbal instructions. Rarely can focus at all in meetings and usually have to ask others about important details afterward or wait for a written meeting summary.
* Time blindness. Time can seem to fly by in a flash or a minute can seem like an hour. Often late as a result of poor assessment of how long things will take or losing track of time.",2,1,1,0.57,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13bg7rn')>,,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/13bg7rn/looking_for_advice_to_prep_for_screening_visit/,,,False

3282,yes,AutismTranslated,2023-05-04 06:18:07,Valgrimm93,Difficulties in conversing with friends,"I recently realized I am very likely autistic and have been doing a ton of research on the subject.  One of the main things that brought me to the conclusion that I might be autistic is how much difficulty I have in socializing, even with friends.  In a group of over about 4 people, I am pretty much screwed and never open my mouth unless asked something directly.  I don't really do small talk and find I am not able to really interact in a group setting.  I do also find I have problems even with my current close friends and sometimes in one on one conversations.

The other day, I ran into the description of top down and bottom up processing, which describes how most NT people think vs how many autistic people think.  My understanding is that in top down processing is used by most NTs. They will hear about a specific topic or read an article and generate an opinion there and then largely based on intuition from their past experiences.  Bottom up processing, on the other hand,  is more common in ND people and means that you approach the same topic or article from a detail oriented  approach.  You look into the subject in great detail before forming a balanced opinion based on the information gathered.  The bottom up method is what I do personally and I rarely claim a solid opinion on anything unless I have looked into it thoroughly.  I might say, ""this is what I have heard"", if I have limited information, but I won't claim a solid opinion if I don't have a solid background on the subject. I am also open to someone changing my opinion if they have new information I haven't previously considered.

Thinking on a recent conversation with one of my friends and other similar conversations I have had in the past, I think that is where a lot of what would be a potentially satisfying conversation for me falls apart.  I give a balanced opinion and they reply with a very fixed opinion based on little but an initial impression.  They are usually unwilling to be convinced much beyond that opinion, and don't have any patience for waiting for you to further explain your side.  That is where I usually run into my personal version of the ""boring other people"" question in all the screening tests.   When trying to explain something I am very familiar with, particularly an interest, they will suddenly just change the subject, start talking to someone else over me or someone else will interrupt and that is the end of my conversation.  Pretty frustrating, but I think I have a better understanding of why it happens now.  Not really sure what I can do about it though, since that is just who I am.

Not that I want to move on from my current friends, but I feel like I need to find some more friends that I am able to relate to better and on a wider range of common interests. Most likely from the ND community, based on what I have seen works for many ND people.  Not sure if anyone else can relate to this or has reasoned out the same in their own experiences.",5,12,12,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='137c0aj')>,,/r/AutismTranslated/comments/137c0aj/difficulties_in_conversing_with_friends/,,,False
3283,yes,AutisticWithADHD,2023-04-28 06:34:33,Valgrimm93,This is quite the journey,"I have posted on a few more specific topics recently but thought I would summarize my 4 week journey and see if anyone could relate or had any advice.

On Mar 27 this year, after feeling a definite increase in anxiety over the last few months since we returned to office work and more of a general normalcy following the lockdowns, I decided maybe some self discovery was in order.  I had had a serious meltdown about 20 years ago which ended in me treated for social anxiety.  I didn't really enjoy what the SSRIs did to me as they turned off my social filter and I had serious issues with almost everyone I knew, since I didn't know how to filter what I was saying on those meds.  I stopped those and managed to find a strategy which got me by (more or less isolation and sinking into my interests).

Now it is 20 years later and I feel a similar building of stress as before my last meltdown.  Some random luck in seeing some autism and ADHD videos on YouTube and TikTok, and I was thinking, ""Some of what those people are saying sounds just like me!!!""  Three days of intense research, doing screening tests, reviewing the DSM-5, looking at peoples experiences on social media later and I was pretty sure it was me.  The only thing is that I had very hazy memories of childhood and thought I needed to dig deeper internally, since I was running out of things to find externally (so I thought).  Next think I know, my brain is involuntarily deciding to do a deep cleaning and reorganizing to dig up childhood memories and reframe remembered experiences with the new information.  

I spent 3 days barely able to think or do anything while my brain reordered and tried to make sense of itself (burnout or meltdown?  I don't know).  Very unpleasant to say the least.  After that was done, I felt like I forgot how to people.  Doing anything was a mental strain and anxiety was constant.  I felt like I had to relearn how to do basic things at work and struggled with essentially all social interactions (fortunately over email and Teams, since I was at home that week).  After about a week, I felt a bit more myself, but have been drained, anxious and immensely distracted until the last few days.  The whole time, including the days I was really having a tough time at the start, I have been driven to spend every spare moment researching all I can about autism and ADHD to exhaustion.

With the help of a combination of Reddit feedback (thanks to you all), reading, looking at information from professionals and people sharing experiences on social media, and self reflection, I have finally managed a clear enough image of myself that my drive is relaxing and I am feeling more comfortable in my own skin.  I have a pretty clear self assessment that I likely have both high masking autism and ADHD with some PDA traits.  I have a preliminary meeting with a therapist specializing in autism and adult diagnosis in 4 weeks.  All sounds great now right?

Well...  Sort of.  I am very happy in how thorough I was able to be in my self discovery process.  Regardless of that, I am still wavering between 95% sure I have it all figured out and 95% sure I am somehow making it all up and it is all a delusion.  Also experiencing sensory issues far above what is usual for me.  I have historically had some sensory discomforts, but since the burnout, has gone far above what it ever was before.  I was feeling pretty good today and went into the grocery store for 10 minutes and my heart rate was up, was anxious, and slightly nauseous within that short time.  Slightly concerned now as my previously ignorant and well masked self never had that hard of a time in my memory.  Discomfort has always been there, but never that bad.

Has anyone had a similar experience after discovering they are likely on the spectrum and a burnout to top it off?  I know everyone may be different, but is it usual that these elevated responses will go back down to the levels I would expect from previous experience over time?  I am also having a hard time keeping my more adamant opinions to myself at work when something annoys me.  I really want to tell people pretty bluntly what I think.  It is all pretty rough at the moment, as a counterbalance to my happiness at having the world make more sense.",4,1,1,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='131jseq')>,,/r/AutisticWithADHD/comments/131jseq/this_is_quite_the_journey/,,,False
3284,yes,AutisticWithADHD,2023-04-24 08:00:52,Valgrimm93,Aversion to scheduling,"Cross posting this here after a comment on another subreddit that it sounds like perhaps autism with ADHD.  I thought perhaps someone here might relate to this.

I recently realized I probably am autistic, due to a large number of traits in common with the DSM-5 criteria and relating to community experiences, however I noticed there is one major difference between myself and the life experiences described by many autistic people. Most autistic people, including my diagnosed son, seem to hold to rigid schedules and are often distressed when they get off schedule.  Even a lot of neurotypical people seem to have a very tight daily schedule for eating meals, sleep, etc.I, on the other hand, am very adverse to scheduling routine daily events.

I think the reason I tend to prefer as little schedule as possible is that I value being able to complete what tasks I feel I need to complete at the pace I need to complete them over scheduling them for specific times.   It is more important to me to have the full amount of time I need before bed to recharge and calm down, or the full amount of time in the morning to do everything I need to do and mentally prepare for the day without set times to limit my flexibility.  I think feeling I had to complete a daily task, that was not time critical, at a specific time would stress me out unnecessarily.

That is not to say I never schedule anything, since I do sometimes have appointments and so forth which are not flexible. For these, Google Calendar is my saviour.  Scheduled appointments do tend to stress me out and I end up arriving 45 minutes or more before I am supposed to be there just to be sure I am not late.   

Any others in the community with the same inclination as myself?  I realize this might be a me problem.   I am fairly adverse, in my personal life, to following social norms I don't understand in general.",23,19,19,0.92,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='12x827t')>,,/r/AutisticWithADHD/comments/12x827t/aversion_to_scheduling/,,,False

3286,yes,AutismTranslated,2023-04-23 04:13:33,Valgrimm93,Sensory issues worsened by elevated stress or anxiety,"I had referenced this briefly in another post recently, but I wanted to focus on asking the community specifically about sensory issues, since they have been causing me significant problems for the last few months.

The first time I looked at the DSM-5 and did some of the checklists, I was like, ""Nope!  No sensory issues!""   When I really thought about it though, there are several I have had all my life, which I just never really thought about as more than personal quirks:

1. Bright lights - I realize I don't think I have owned a light that wasn't dim or dimmable in my life.  I seek shade or stay in on sunny days like a vampire.  I hate fluorescent lights or any other bright environments and avoid them when I can.
2. Heat - I absolutely abhor heat and being sweaty.   Constantly have heat rashes and feel exhausted or faint at any temperature above about 22C when outside or 25C when sitting inside.  I will become nauseous or faint if I am out in the sun on a hot day too long.  I know this is probably something everyone experiences, but I crash and burn well before most other people.
3. Sounds - Low constant or repetitive noises, such as tap dripping, ventilation systems; people whispering or making drawn out 's' sounds when speaking.
4. Textures - Clothing textures such as wool or specific non-breathable synthetic fabrics.  Also any food texture similar to soft fat or skin from any kind of meat (not crispy like bacon) literally makes me gag.

I don't experience these at the same level as some autistic people I have seen comment before, where their sensory issues can lead them to a meltdown on their own, so I really don't know if these are all possible autistic traits or just the same personal preferences any NT person would have.  What I can say though, is that low steady background noises and bright lights have been really significantly more troublesome the last few months and especially since I identified them as sources of stress in my self discovery process.

In particular, bright fluorescent lights and white backgrounds on my monitors at work just absolutely melt my eyes recently and give me almost instant headaches.  I have also taken to wearing noise cancelling headphones at work to clear out the ventilation noise and ambient background so I can concentrate.

The other day at work, I made a discovery.   I was at a relatively low stress level that day and for a change had no headache and the lights weren't bothering me too much.  Then I got an email with some good news and it spiked my anxiety (excitement?) for some reason.  Suddenly it was as if they turned the lights to broil and looking at my monitors was almost unbearable for an hour or two until my level of anxiety  went back down to normal.  So my level of sensory discomfort seems directly tied to my ambient and immediate stress levels.

Does anyone else have the same experience as myself, where environmental sensory issues are generally tolerable, but can become intolerable in an instant if other factors in your environment increase your stress level?",7,17,17,0.96,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='12vv6ay')>,,/r/AutismTranslated/comments/12vv6ay/sensory_issues_worsened_by_elevated_stress_or/,,,False
3287,yes,AutismTranslated,2023-04-21 06:49:40,Valgrimm93,"What is ""normal""?","I am 47 and I have recently discovered  I most likely am autistic.   I essentially worked from home and barely left my house far a few years, during the pandemic, and seem to have lost some learned social skills on the way.  Since things have been more back to normal, I find I am more anxious in public and at my office than I remember.  It led me to reflect on some things that trouble me now, and that I realize have been with me forever.  The things that really made me start looking deeper in the last month were:

1)  Talk of doing semi scripted presentations at work.  This terrifies me and makes me semi shutdown just on rumination.  I can talk to a number of clients on the spur of the moment about a familiar subject to me with little discomfort,  but presenting some random thing for my company is out of the question.   I have no idea what the difference is.   The best I can come up with is that it feels inauthentic to me, similar to small talk, which I am also virtually incapable of doing.

2)  I was in line at the store with a few people in front of me.  I saw the cashier was a cheerful sort and chatty with people in front of me.  While I usually don't make eye contact and try to minimize interactions like that, I do sometimes try to match their energy and return their cheerful demeanor for practice and to be polite.   Oddly,  despite my effort, when it was my turn, he was very flat and business like with no excess chat.  This is not a one off but happens to me frequently.  I don't know if I am reading people wrong or giving off a strange vibe myself that people behave so unexpectedly.

3)  I have long term and short term intense interests which at times are virtually uncontrollable.   For example,  computers and PC games are a long term interest for me.  I don't just play games.  When focused on them,  pretty much all I do is research games or a specific one.  Once I latch onto something interesting I don't own,  i will research it and decide if I would want to buy it.  Then I will check for a sale.  Then buy, if on sale, or think, ""I have such a backlog already.  I will wait for a sale.""  Then after 2 hours of resisting,  dwelling on it, I buy it anyway.  I literally have to avoid looking at some of my more expensive interests to prevent an inevitable purchase of something I probably don't need right then.

4)  I essentially never talk at a gathering of more than 4 people, even if all friends or acquaintances, unless I can talk to one or two at a time.  I am not scared of rejection or anything in that scenario,  so I have no idea why my ability to talk just shuts off.

None of these things made sense to me, so I decided to dig further.  So now my focused interest is neurodiversity itself and I have found a lot more things I do that meet the DSM 5 criteria for autism.  After basically 3 weeks of steady research, I am fairly  sure my self discovery is pointing me in the right direction,  but I keep swaying back and forth between surety and imposter syndrome because of one question.  What is ""normal""?

Some things everyone does to some extent (stimming, for example) so how do you know where it crosses the line to an autistic trait?  How do I know if I can read someone's body language and facial expressions normally since I don't know what a ""normal"" experience is?  I don't know if I really read much visually from people at all.  I mostly read others by what they say and their tone of voice.  That is not even to mention the screening tests where they ask questions about how others see you.  How the hell do I know?  I don't really associate with people who would call me out on the kind of things they are asking about in the questions.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to figure out what is considered ""normal"" when defining an autistic trait vs a similar NT one?  I do have an appointment to talk to a therapist specializing in autism,  but that is in 6 weeks.  Was hoping someone might have some suggestions to help alleviate some of my uncertainty in the meantime.",11,12,12,0.88,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='12tt5er')>,,/r/AutismTranslated/comments/12tt5er/what_is_normal/,,,False
3288,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-04-19 00:13:32,Valgrimm93,Issues after self diagnosis of autism,"I would like to share my recent experiences in a form slightly longer than War and Peace, after 3 straight weeks of research and self reflection,  but will try to keep this shorter so someone may actually read it. 🙂 

I am a 47M with an officially diagnosed 16 year old autistic son.  I had been having some increased anxiety at work and in social situations since largely being at home during the pandemic.   I started to question (yet again) why I struggle with social interactions so much.  I don't consciously feel like I care what people think of me, but avoid social interactions like the plague (and have for most of my life).  Thinking back on my current and past life,  I ran into more and more illogical contradictions in my behavior I couldn't make work.  In addition, as my son grows older,  he seems more and more like how I was at his age (and beyond). 

I decided it was time for some self reflection and, in the process, ran across many instances online of autistic people sharing their experiences that struck chords with me so strongly they brought tears to my eyes.  I began digging deeper into official medical information and felt like it perhaps didn't sound like me, but was better framed when I heard others explain what the criteria represented in actual behavior.  About 3 days in to my research,  I decided I needed to really dig back into my memories to see if this was really with me since childhood or if it was actually social anxiety disorder, as I was diagnosed with at 28 after a multiple day severe burnout.  That is when it happened...

My mind apparently decided to make my inner examination of my past my new very intense focus interest (of which I have always had one or more throughout my life) and seemed to try to tear itself apart looking inward for answers.  I would describe it as like taking everything out of every storage area in your house and throwing it all over the floor at once and then trying to slowly figure out how to put it all back together in a way that made sense.  I spent 3 days after that in intense mental pain and stress as my brain tried to forcibly sort things out.  I did actually successfully pull a bunch of long forgotten things out of my past which fit that I was very likely autistic as a child, though apparently mostly unrecognized by my parents and teachers due to presentation and circumstance.  I was also driven to keep researching and finding experiences of autistic people which would give me a new spike of mental strain whenever something clicked into place.  

After 3 days of this,  I was mentally exhausted and barely able to think at all.  I was having persistent anxiety and decided I needed some professional help to sort this all out.  I contacted our local autism organization and asked for a list of providers familiar with autistic adults.  I sent an email to the recommended therapist who may be able to provide an adult diagnosis, with the hope I could use it for accommodations at work and for peace of mind.

Because I know that is a long process and I was hoping some clarity from my parents would help.  I knew it was a mistake, but hoped somehow they would be understanding despite my reservations.   Well that didn't go well.  They told me some additional things which supported what I had remembered myself until they found out why I was asking.  My father literally tried to force my left-handed brother to be right-handed as a child, so I don't know why he would ever support me in something he would consider stigmatized as much as autism.  My mother views the world through rose colored glasses so of course said things that made it obvious she was glossing over things I clearly remembered having issues with let alone remembering me as anything but perfectly well adjusted.  I figure that ends any hope of official diagnosis since my parents won't cooperate and wouldn't want to see me with that label.

Next I decided to talk to my manager at work  to see if I could get any accommodations based on my anxiety alone, which did go much better.  They basically agreed to take anything off my plate that was affecting my mental health and I just had to ask.  That made me feel a spike of peace and relief temporarily since that essentially removed one major reason for even getting a diagnosis.  Now there is just my own peace of mind.

I am now 2 weeks past all this and still obsessed with  researching autism and related conditions.   I seem to clearly have symptoms of both autism and ADHD that go back as far as I can remember.  I have recognized sensory issues such a bright light, heat and repetitive noises, such as a dripping tap or ambient quiet office noises,  as things that bother me much more than I ever recognized before.  I am not sure if my near constant elevated anxiety for the last 3 weeks is contributing, but bright lights and even ambient light outside on a cloudy day have become literally painful.  Social interactions are even more difficult than usual and my previous ability to look people in the eyes, if necessary,  is much more difficult.  Because of such a sudden increase in intensity for these issues,  I feel like I am faking it somehow,  although I can't imagine why I would want life to suck so much on a daily basis when I was doing a passable job of getting by with all this stuff hidden from myself (and perhaps everyone else) before.  I feel like I opened Pandora's box and can't decide if I am relieved to have found others experiencing the same life issues as me or regret that  I ever opened it to begin with.  

Now for the questions:

1) Has anyone had an intense, almost involuntary, brain restructuring experience as I did?  I don't know if it was overload or what, but it was very painful and stressful even if strangely satisfying since it helped me fit things together.  I am still anxious and barely able to think clearly due to mental exhaustion weeks later, as I write this.

2) Has anyone had a sudden increase in intensity of sensory input and social discomfort after diagnosis or self diagnosis?  I am wondering if it is just because my base anxiety levels are so high that I have no headroom without going over the top with any added stress. Perhaps they will go down to a more routine level once I make more progress in working through this.

3)  I don't actually know what to do now.  I am not sure I need an official diagnosis anymore, since my work will accommodate me on my social anxiety history alone.  Even though I am quite sure I am right with my self diagnosis,  I still am having pretty significant imposter syndrome.  I continue to research endlessly, hoping for an answer I will likely never find myself, in a way that will satisfy my need for confirmation.  I am wondering if seeing a therapist who has experience with autistic adults may be able to help me work through this, as I feel stuck.  I am just not sure what I would be looking for from a therapist besides confirmation, which would likely only come with a positive diagnosis.  Any advice is welcome.

Thanks to anyone who cared enough to make it this far.  I realize the greatly abbreviated version is still very long.",6,1,1,0.67,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='12r9wd3')>,,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/12r9wd3/issues_after_self_diagnosis_of_autism/,,,False

I would like to get something with good potency and flavour.  ""A"" rating, appearance and bag appeal are not all that important as long as the quality is otherwise on point.  I am just trying to avoid getting stuck with an ounce of weak or subpar crap. 

I see that several sites have these right now however they seem to mostly be either budget/outdoor bud or be on sites with a history of inconsistent quality.  Has anyone tried any of the current batches of these strains that are still available and are of good quality for the price?

Edit:   If anyone knows of a MOM that frequently stocks good versions of these strains but are out right now, that would be a big help too! 👽",4,6,6,0.76,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='eoy037')>,,/r/CanadianMOMs/comments/eoy037/source_for_quality_trainwreck_ghost_train_haze_or/,,,False
3292,yes,vaporents,2019-11-19 06:00:53,Valgrimm93,My brain is broken - Splinter V2 with Voopoo Drag 2,"I just ordered a Splinter V2 online today and picked up a Voopoo Drag 2 box mod to pair with it.  I had read about people using custom firmware for several other box mods to activate temperature control however it seems like the built in temperature control works for the Gene chipset in the Voopoo, if set up correctly.  After looking around extensively and comparing what I am reading to the available settings, it seems the reality is more complicated than the theory.   I have looked up some recommended coefficient settings to start with however the interface is confusing the hell out of me.   On the Coil Advanced Setting page of the Windows app,  I am assuming the two settings relevant to use with the Splinter are perhaps the Stainless Steel 316 (SS) setting and the TCR (TC) settings. 

I have seen settings for the Splinter of SS: 1380 to SS:1500 thrown around and what I am wondering if that means both the TC and SS setting should be set to this.  Is the SS setting for wattage mode and the TC for temperature control mode?  I am assuming once I get these set up, I will also need consider wattage and resistance settings for temp control mode, although i don't see those in the Windows app.

If anyone uses this setup or has any insight into some good starter settings for temp control mode, any help would be much appreciated.
