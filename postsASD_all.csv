I read that one technique people with autism use in social situations is to mimic the person they are taking to in order to fit in and have acceptable behaviour. 
I had no idea I did this but my wife has been watching me do it for a year or two and it's one reason she wanted me to get tested. She was afraid to say it to me in case I got really upset and she was right, I would have. 
I did notice over the years, when talking to people 1 to 1 I picked up the other persons accent very easily.

18,yes,CPTSD,2023-04-04 16:55:37,Solid-Ad-75,Question about grooming,"My mum was molested by her grandfather growing up. She used to scream about all men being pedos and rapists when I was a kid, I was very parentified in trying to sooth her and remind her dad isn't a rapist (just a normal chauvanist! Haha). 

She used to talk about sex like, I don't know how to describe it but it was weird. She was too open and inappropriate, told me about very adult stuff when I was a bit too young to know about it (end of primary school? Not sure. Certianly before we did it in sex ed).she was enthusiastic like she was horny? I don't know if that's exaggerating but she wanted me to think sex was great and I should really enjoy it and know that it's about love and a load of crap. The polar exteme opposite of anal conservative mums. 

I was groomed online when I was 13, molested by a boy (17) at 14, raped by a man at 15-going-on-16 (21), raped again, and then in a sexually abusive (still not sure if I should call it that, both 16) for two years.

The Internet pedo spoke like my mum, acted like he was being sex positive. If im a feminist I'd be into that, but also being bi means im just as perverted as him (boo freaking who, the gods will burn him). I thought he was just an adult giving advice. He sent me links to violent BDSM porn and tried to cybersex with me. So it was pretty bad. Only remembered him two years ago (I'm 28 in August!) so that's a deep wound. 

Anyway, I was behaving strangely - shut off from everyone and then was hypersexualised after I was rape. I don't know who started it but my mum and I used to grope (""honk honk"") each others breasts (both of us were well endowed, I'm a trans man so I'd rather call it that lol. The gods will burn cis men with tit fetishises.). I did that to a few girls at school and got suspended (there was a whole drama that lead to that but I digress, i was reported by a girl who exaggerated it out of spite bc she was a cheating whore and i called her that to her face. Girls are lovely to eachother!). 

My mum encouraged that behaviour a lot in fact. Like idk if it was the abuse I experienced  that caused it or my mum's reckless enabling. She's fucking clueless. She's better now, I forgive her bc I know what she survived but my god she was a shit mother. 

Would you consider how my mum behaved grooming?

22,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-05-17 12:57:57,luna_bea_tuna,My life is falling apart,"WARNING: This is a vent.

Self diagnosed 6 months ago. Married and have a 3 year old, live far from family (another continent far).

My life has been slowly falling apart. 
- I started anti depressants 2 years ago for depression and anxiety, which has caused weight gain to which I am reacting poorly (I hate how I look and I put a lot of my self worth in appearance). The medication does not help with depression but helped with anxiety, until it didn't. I am going to go off this medication since it's not helping. 
- 2 months ago i left my job/was asked to leave (it was mutual). I'm at 7-8 years of recurring burnout at every job I've had. I can't see a future where I work without burning out once a year, hating and resenting my job and then leaving or quitting. I think about starting a new career but feel hopeless there's anything else I can actually do. I feel so useless.

- my wife and I are constantly fighting and it's the same triggers. In various situations I will get overwhelmed and become nonverbal, and she will push for words or her needs. I try to explain I'm all out of spoons and can't do anything more but she keeps pushing and asking for more or rejecting what I am saying and minimizing my experience. To her point, I get so overwhelmed and then yell or be angry when i communicate, which is totally unfair to her, but I can't stop myself. I get so angry when I'm trying to communicate what's happening and am interrupted and talked over or my experience is minimized. I feel hopeless I can be the partner she needs and that she can be the partner I need. The ASD possibility is still pretty new and I think she would respond better to reading about it versus me explaining myself. Our 3 year old takes all my energy. Constant noise and needs. Makes every stressful situation that I was able to get through in the past impossible. I think outside of burnout I'm a good father and usually enjoy the experience. But it gets to be so much. I don't understand how to do this. I'm failing and there's nothing that can be done.

Health, job, family all on the decline with no light at the end. I can see this is only going to end one way.

23,yes,u_luna_bea_tuna,2023-05-08 11:22:42,luna_bea_tuna,Beckmann Street FLX 30-35 - First Impressions,"I was pretty sure this bag wasn't going to work for me (its 1.5kg empty) but I really wanted to at least spend a bit more time trying it out than in the store. I had a look at the Beckmann 26L a few months ago and it felt too heavy and small in capacity (for the bulk/size) so thought maybe the 30-35L would be better. Also, I really like the look of matte black rubberized bags :| 

&#x200B;

My Requirements:

* I would \*like\* to have a bag that usually 20L but can expand to swallow another backpack (my sons + various kid winter or rain gear). I thought maybe a 30L bag would still be small enough for EDC.
* Water repellant (no need for rain cover for a 30min bike commute)
* Less than 1kg
* Water bottle pocket
* One big compartment with a few internal pockets.

&#x200B;

Some of this is copy pasted from my last 'review' of the 26L, but still applies as the bag is very similar. The Beckmann website has pretty good pictures and details of the exterior and internals, but thought I would also give an initial first impression and review and maybe some more details on the size of pockets and typically what you can fit in the bag. I haven't used the bag more than what I've done for this initial review as I don't intend on keeping it.

&#x200B;

Some findings and thoughts (aside from what you find on the website):

* It feels like a good quality bag.
* It stands up on its own (when empty), though it looks like it will fall over. Maybe if loaded in a strange way.
* The lid tends to want to flap in, covering the top opening when unzipped. I could flip it out, but seems to prefer going in. A bit annoying when I wanted to fill the bag. 
* The extra 5L is a wedge shape and...I guess adds 5L volume. I wish the bag were smaller when this was zipped up or bigger when unzipped. But maybe I didn't test packing it well enough.

&#x200B;

* Outside:
   * The bag is big. It's a 30L bag though so that shouldn't be unexpected, and the material is stiff enough that it retains its shape when empty, which I like, but then it means its always big (ish). 
   * The outer materials (soft touch rubberized) feel and looks great.
   * Materials have a 'quality' thickness to them. Like they aren't going to tear any time soon.
   * The zippers slide really smoothly, going from all the open to all the way closed, they didn't snag along the way.
   * The straps all have strap keepers.
   * The back panel is well padded and rigid, from both an internal plastic sheet (i think) and there's a (maybe removable) flat aluminum piece running down the spine I guess for extra laptop protection? Or maybe its a shoe horn for shoe horning on the go.
   * The compression straps have buckles! Should be good for maybe also getting a jacket in there, or even something long that sits in the water bottle pocket. Also, these have strap keepers. Nice.
   * 2 external water bottle pockets, which are on the medium size. My big water bottle fit but it felt like I was overstretching the pocket. For a 'normal' size water bottle, a twisty bike lock, or anything else I just need to shove in there on the go they will do nicely.
   * 2 external pockets, one on the lid, and one on the front. The lid one has a lot of capacity and the front a bit less, but still useful, also a bit trickier to get into.

&#x200B;

* Inside
   * The laptop sleeve is lined with a velvety material. It real nice.
   * On the front there's a hand size mesh zip pocket and a headphone size elastic pocket.
   * There's also 2 mesh 'water bottle' elastic pockets along the insides and a document sleeve
   * The velvety laptop sleeve is big enough for my 16in laptop but the laptop is tall enough that the velcro flap can't engage

&#x200B;

Thoughts

* It's a super nice bag. Good size pockets and placement. But too big for me for EDC. Though that's more of a 'me' problem.
* I really want my next bag to have a light coloured inner liner. With a top loader, it can be really hard to see into the bag and where all the things are.
* My expectation was that the expansion would result in either a much smaller bag when not expanded or a much larger bag when expanded. But it was just a bit more space.
* Was this review helpful? Not sure. 

&#x200B;

I can't regulate my body temperature and end up too hot or too cold really easily. I am trying to find a backpack that I can quickly store and take out my puffy winter coat or rain coat on the go (bike, outside, inside, bus).

I'm constantly on the lookout for an expandable rolltop style backpack, but that has additional access. I was inspired by this post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacks/comments/114hmlz/20222023\_everydaymultipurposeversatile\_clean/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacks/comments/114hmlz/20222023_everydaymultipurposeversatile_clean/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3))

Most of the bags here were listed in other reddit posts, so thank you to everyone that contributed. And please comment if you have more suggestions :)

Need: EDC backpack that can expand to fit my jacket, or another small child size backpack / kids snow gear.

I have really been struggling with meltdowns every evening. My son is 3 and is super talkative and my partner is also a super talker.  

There are 2 situations that I really struggle with with my family. I'm hoping someone out there has similar experience and found a solution that could maybe help me too.

1) Both my NT partner and son will be talking at me (usually in a small room / confined space that I can't just leave without going through them). I am overwhelmed by too much sound and can't understand either of them, and I meltdown because of the noise stimulus. I TRY to tell them calmy to both stop talking, but it comes out as yell or as short words. I have tried to explain to my partner that at that point my communication energy is gone and any words I use just come out and I need them to understand it is not I am angry, I am just overwhelmed and don't have the energy to 'calm down and ask in a calm manner' in that moment. They interpret the whole exchange as me telling them to ''shut up''. In my mind I am suffering and pleading with them to stop talking, but they see it as me aggressively trying to shut them down and control them. Despite talking about this afterwards, they can't help but see it this way. I feel so guilty now, and trapped, like I can never have my needs met or this part of me understood or accepted, and that I am 'bad' for having this need. Or that we are just a bad match doomed to fail (if we aren't already failing). Or that I'm just not a match for anyone and should really be alone 90% of the time.

She reenacted a hand symbol I try to use (the stop hand symbol) and did it so angrily at me, it felt like I was being mocked. How can I explain how desperate and overwhelmed I am in those situations? It's like I'm drowning and thrashing around in the water. We have decided I will use the ''I love you'' hand symbol instead of trying to talk and hopefully this makes in a difference in the way we both react.

2) In the evenings after pickup from daycare, my son will talk non-stop. I'm realizing that at the end of a workday, I'm probably all out of spoons from work and interacting with others in the world. So, when it comes to bed time and winding down, he will be talkative/noisy and not listening to us, and both the non-stop noise and focused effort push me into a meltdown. My partner's reaction was to say to me 'don't meltdown', when I really wish they would be empathetic and comforting and see I'm in distress. It's like saying ''don't drown'' to someone who's drowning and can't swim.

In general they don't seem to have any empathy for what I'm experiencing. I'm feeling so guilty for the way I react. The whole experience is depressing and the only way I see things changing is to leave (either the marriage/family or this world).",4,0,0,0.5,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='10fxih9')>,,/r/autism/comments/10fxih9/how_to_explain_my_needs_to_my_partner_and_how_do/,False

Hello! Last week my wife suggested I may be on the autistic spectrum (based on a discussion with another friend that discovered they are on the spectrum later in life). 

Well, I’ve jumped down the rabbit hole, and taken all the self tests which say I am highly likely on the spectrum. And I feel a strong resonance with what Ive read about asd on Reddit and elsewhere.

I worry I am an imposter and not autistic, and just adjusting my feelings and personality or picking and choosing what makes sense to indicate I’m autistic as a way to explain my past behaviour and feelings, and feel like I finally belong in a group. Or treating it like an excuse for “bad” behaviour, like because I have autism I can’t be expected to not freak out in triggering situations.

I’m wondering if it really matters if I am autistic or not. Though it may matter from an understanding self and “treatment” perspectives. And could also be an explanation for the anxiety and depression, like those are symptoms of unaddressed autism? Or maybe it’s a super fun combination of all 3.

38,yes,depression,2022-11-15 09:16:53,luna_bea_tuna,Visualized tools for depression,"Hi - I suffer from anxiety and depression and take medication for both, and am in therapy to articulate the way I feel, have someone challenge or validate feelings, and learn tools to use on a daily basis to help myself when I am feeling deep sadness, hopelessness or purposelessness. 

What I haven't been able to do is really take anything I learn in therapy to help myself outside of the 24hr window after therapy. My brain is so fuzzy that I struggle to remember the tools I have learned and it feels like I haven't grown at all and am in the same spot as years ago. So I get caught in the whirlwind and spin out.

I started watching (haven't finished) the Jonah Hill netflix special about his therapist, who uses some drawing/visualization techniques (in the therapy session at least) and I felt inspired. I am thinking of having physical things to remind me of different tools to use - either like actual objects/jewelry or drawing/non-permanent tattoo/stickers. 

So for reddit I ask this:

1. What are your ''tools'' / techniques for working through feelings in the moment?
2. Do you have any physical/visualized objects/techniques to remind yourself? Or if not, how do you remember them? Or jolt yourself out of a moment to remember that you even have tools?

I expect not every technique works for everyone, and that everyone struggles with different depression and anxiety challenges, but I appreciate any shared thoughts.

Was working well for managing both. Depression came back (constant suicide ideation, spinning out) due to a period of higher stress, and I decided to up my dose to 225mg, as I was out of town and not able to see my doctor or therapist and didn’t know what else to do. After 4 weeks on 225mg I feel better than I did on 150mg, better at managing social situations and depressive episodes, though it may also be because the high stress period is gone. I saw my doctor finally and she said I should not go above 150mg (effect of the drug is not much higher but side effects would be much higher) and instead prescribed another medication to complement venlafaxin for depression. 

But given that I feel better on 225mg…I kind of want to stay on this dosage for longer and not add another drug. Talking more with her is probably the best move, instead of just not listening and taking 3x75mg and not 150mg + the new medication.

44,yes,Anxiety,2022-07-12 16:51:57,luna_bea_tuna,I can't plan anything by myself,"A bit of background: I'm married and have a 2 year old, and work a 9-5 job. We live abroad away from family so don't really have any help taking care of our son. All that is to say I find my normal responsibilities tend to fill my time and am generally bad about making time for myself, though I do get some hours here and there for hobbies.

  
Last year I started taking medication for anxiety and depression (which in retrospect I have had my entire life. Neat!) and seeing a therapist. I went on sick leave due to ongoing anxiety attacks about a new job, and suffered the usual dreading waking up everyday and seeing no point in life. You know, the usual. Eventually I changed jobs and along with the medication and therapy got past the anxiety.

For the first time in years, I now have a week off to myself (wife and kid are visiting family and I'm on vacation), and I find it impossible to plan something fun to do by myself. Usually I am so overwhelmed being around other people that I keep imagining I will go off on a hiking trip by myself and just get away from everyone. 

But when it comes down to planning a trip, even just a day trip, I get tunnel vision and have trouble focusing and generally feel short of breath and overwhelmed. I'm so uncertain and overwhelmed about where to go, what gear I should buy (and should I even buy gear for a one or two time thing), if I actually want to go on a trip, what I even want to do. And I am so afraid of making the wrong choice, that I just don't choose. And then my whole ''deal'' of wanting to get away from everyone is revealed to be an obtainable fantasy, or just not really what I want. And then the question is what do I want to do with the precious free time I have.

This is pretty typical for me planning ANYTHING, that I either waste my time in indecision, or give up. Generally my wife does all the planning, and I can help her make decisions...but when it comes to myself I'm hopeless.

Maybe it means that I need to plan something with a friend, but for just this once I don't want to have be following what someone else wants to do, or needing to ask for help or borrow gear or...maybe its unrealistic given it's something I've never done before.

45,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-05-27 04:33:12,Putrid-Occasion1881,Autism and BPD? *Vent,"I got diagnosed with autism as an adult but I know of at least 2 people that are knowledgeable on both disorders and who know I'm autistic, that have noticed enough symptoms of BPD in me to ask my partner directly if I have this comorbidity. He said the idea has also crossed his mind since we met. 

I don't have a BPD diagnosis and none of my healthcare providers have mentioned it to me in my life but then again they didn't catch the autism until I brought it up either. I was curious that so many people were seeing this disorder in me so I did some research into it and it was uncomfortable how relatable it felt. I looked into specifically how autism and BPD can overlap and how they differ and I still relate very much to both. 

I don't really know what I'm looking for. For some reason I thought my autism diagnosis would be the last major psychiatric diagnosis I would receive in my life so I don't think I want to pursue if I would qualify for a formal diagnosis right now. I think I'm just uncomfortable because it feels like every time I finally figure out what's going on with me, there ends up being something else still.

 Does anyone else have experience with this comorbidity? Am I leaping to conclusions here by assuming there's a high chance I have this disorder based on my internet research and observations from others alone? This is how I discovered my autism after all. Is it worth bringing up to my therapist and/or psychiatrist to see what they think? I worry they'll think I'm being dramatic and that I'm looking for something to be wrong with me.

46,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-04-06 19:50:04,Putrid-Occasion1881,how much can coping skills and such improve autism symptoms?,"Autism comes with all sorts of symptoms obviously but generally with certain symptoms like anxiety, sensory difficulties, social struggles and such, there are things that can be done to, not take away, but improve the symptom. For example I can't take away the anxiety but I can learn skills to cope with it and eventually make it easier.  I can't take the sensory overload away but I can practice exposure and other skills to develop a higher tolerance for it. 

I guess my question is how do I determine if a symptom can or should be worked on and how do I know if it's something I can continue to improve or if I've reached the max improvement I can make. Because if I can just continue to improve with it then I would think we could all just therapy our way out of autism but obviously that's not how it works. 

I've had a lot of conversations with people telling me things like ""I know it's a symptom of your autism but it's still not ok and we need to find a way to work on it/change the behavior"". Which of course autistic people are just like others and we have the capacity to hurt feelings even if it's a symptom and we don't mean to. But how much of a change in behavior is reasonable to expect before it becomes ableist? I don't disagree with the conversations for the most part. Usually it's something like I was really overwhelmed but rather than give myself space when i knew I was getting there I blew up at someone. So yeah, reasonable to want a change there I think. 

I'm having difficulty finding the line with what's reasonable to expect from myself and what's not. There have been occasions when looking back I can tell it was ableist but in the moment I just feel ashamed because I take so long to change behaviors. I don't know if this makes much sense.

At first I only noticed it at night in bed so I though it could be bed bugs or fleas but neither my boyfriend who's highly allergic to fleas, or my dog showed any sort of reaction. Eventually we moved out of state and spend about 4 months moving from hotel to Airbnb until we finally got an apartment. The rash was present the whole time which ruled out the bed bugs and my dog and boyfriend have at no point shown any signs of anything so no fleas either. I thought maybe something got into the cloth seats of my car but again, no one else has shown any sort of reaction.

In this time I haven't started or stopped any new products or medications. I get these big pink welts on my skin and they'll show up on my legs, arms, back, chest, stomach, or hands. It seems the only place they won't go is my face. It's so itchy that I'll break skin because I'm scratching so hard. But it seems like it disappears as quickly as it shows up. I can't pinpoint anything that triggers it and it seems to show up in a different spot every time, at all hours of the day now.

I've been struggling with it basically since I became sexually active. My partner has helped a lot seeing as he's the only person that has given me the time to explore my likes and dislikes with him but even still, the sensory overwhelm has a really big effect and I can only follow through about once every five or seven times we initiate it. He's super understanding and doesn't ever try to make me feel bad about it but I know he doesn't understand the extent of how it affects me and talking about it can sometimes be difficult and frustrating. 

It's not that I don't want it or anything, I do. It's just that whenever we start I get really overwhelmed and my mind starts focusing on everything else around me. I'm normally really ticklish which is also a major sensory trigger so I'll start anticipating that when his fingers touch me the sensation is too light and then that feeling of overwhelm won't go away and I have to stop things. My previous therapist brought up that there may have been some sort of assault in my childhood which I don't think is a huge stretch to assume because I have a lot of sensitivity around that whole topic. It's mostly another conversation but applies here because it's also a thought that comes up when we initiate sex. Not that either of us is doing anything wrong, I can't really put into words what the exact thoughts are, just that they're there and about that topic.

58,yes,AskVet,2021-10-23 05:51:26,Putrid-Occasion1881,Can repeated exposure to marijuana smoke cause nerve damage in a cat?,"My friend's roommate's cat is a 14 year old overweight tabby cat who lives day and night in the kitchen. He can't go outside because he has severe allergies. Both him and his roommate regularly smoke weed indoors for medical purposes. My friend smokes in his room across the house from the kitchen with the door shut, windows open and makes reasonable efforts to keep the smell from traveling to the rest of the house, which roommate has said works well. The roommate is currently sleeping in the living room for unrelated reasons. He only smokes stiizy pods though the living room connects directly with the kitchen. The kitchen does have a door on it that always remains shut. 

Recently the cat was seen acting very lethargic and later was unable to walk properly. The roommate took the cat to the vet but when he returned he told my friend that the vet had asked him directly if anyone in the house smoked marijuana and then said that the reason for the cat's behavior was that it was being exposed so regularly to weed that it was constantly high and it was causing neurological damage. The cat is receiving treatment and is recovering well and my roommate no longer smokes in the house but my question is more about how a vet would come to this conclusion. Is it possible that it's so obvious weed was causing the issue that the vet felt confident to ask for it specifically? The roommate also said that the vet specified that a stiizy wouldn't be able to cause the damage in the way a bong or dab rig could which would make sense except that the roommate has confirmed themself that the efforts my friend had been putting into masking the smell had been effective and also my friend is across the house and the smoke would have to travel and get through a couple of doors. And yes, while a stiizy isn't nearly as strong, repeated use throughout the entire day still leaves the house smelling just as if you've been smoking from a dab all day and it wouldn't be hard to make it into the kitchen if people are regularly opening the door to go in and out. 

My friend and I are just really confused as to the circumstances of the diagnosis, especially since he's basically receiving all the blame.

I get intense anxiety when I'm around them and at home in general and it's severely affecting my ability to function at all. The only way I see my situation improving is if I find somewhere else to live but that won't happen until I can get a job and keep it for more than a few months which I haven't been able to do.

Talking about things with someone does help but I hear people talk about going to therapy and working on how to process certain events or learning coping skills and getting homework that they have to do and I've never felt like I got any of that in therapy. I've been to about 7 or 8 different therapists, most of them for 2+ years but every session was just them asking me how my week was or talking about things they felt were important but even then we never really explore those things for more than that session. I tend to not bring things up unless asked but usually when I'm asked I immediately forget what it was i needed to talk about. I was able to bring that up once but the response i got was ""well if you can't tell me what's bothering you then I can't help you"" which is fair but I had been expecting an answer more along the lines of ""ok let's explore that and see if there's a reason you can't remember"". 
     I was sort of diagnosed with asd about 8 months ago and am now in the middle of getting an official assessment done. I've been out of therapy for a few months now and I know I really need to find a new one sooner than later with covid restrictions being loosened plus, among other things, the fact that I'm moving at some point this year and have no idea how I'm going to handle that.
     My question is if anyone knows of a specific type or types of therapy that are more beneficial to people on the spectrum? Normally I just go with the first therapist that calls me back but this time I'd like to try to find someone who's a little more able to help.

65,yes,AutisticAdults,2021-04-16 11:03:53,Putrid-Occasion1881,cw: self harm. Just a long rant because I need to talk about things but don't have anyone to do that with,"(CW: self harm for second to last paragraph in case anyone is sensitive to that.) I feel like I just gave up. I've been feeling like real shit lately, just losing hope about the future and my life and lately I've really been wondering why I even try anymore. I'm 21 and I live at home still which I know is not a bad thing at all and is pretty normal but I have to drop out of school because I can't even keep it together for one semester and while I just applied for a job, it was more out of a combination of being desperate to leave and also to prove that I'm not just lazy or worthless and to not be a burden  anymore though realistically I don't think I'm capable of being a reliable employee at all right now.

I know I'm autistic and I have a diagnosis to back it up but in the last few years I came to be pretty comfortable with myself which resulted in a big change of personality from being a very socially impaired teen to being decently outgoing, social, and responsible enough to acquire management positions at a few different fast food places. I know none of that means I'm not autistic however that's exactly what it seems to mean to all of my family that is aware of the diagnosis. My mom keeps asking me if I'm sure it's autism and keeps telling me about the other diagnoses she thinks suit me better. Mostly she says it's just anxiety and that I need to stop holding onto grudges (she's referring to meltdowns I had because she went and completely deep cleaned my room while I was in the mental hospital after she specifically promised she wouldn't touch anything and then waited until an hour before I got home to tell me and then got mad at me for having a meltdown because she spent a lot of time on it and I should be more grateful. The grudge I'm apparently holding is that I don't want her touching anything in my room at all because I can't trust that she's going to do what she tells me she's going to do. Not that it stops her anyway).

I know I'm autistic but I feel like it can't be true if everyone that knows me best is saying I'm wrong. Logically I know that there are a multitude of reasons as to why I'm autistic but there's still a big part of me that thinks that I'm just overreacting and making a huge deal of nothing. I have a diagnosis but even that feels iffy because the psychologist that diagnosed me has no experience with autistic people and couldn't really answer my questions about it beyond basic google type answers that I can and have found myself. He referred me to autism speaks and I stopped seeing him after I told him I struggle with getting myself to do daily tasks which make it really hard to function and he told me that I need to stop thinking that I can't do it and instead to think that I can and if that doesn't work then he can't help me and I need to see a neurologist.  I haven't had success with finding any other psychologist or organization to go to that takes my insurance. I want to get a second opinion just to be sure but my insurance doesn't cover diagnosis at all. I've heard that most don't.

I'm terrified that someone is going to tell me that no, the diagnosis was wrong and/or not valid and that it really all is in my head and I'm just selfish and ungrateful and lazy like my mother says I am. I'm afraid to even say I'm autistic or fill in or click the bubble on forms and stuff because someone is going to catch me in this lie I've come up with. I'm trying to learn more about it and myself but I still have trouble recognizing what my meltdowns even look and feel like let alone what causes them. I read an article that said it's good to explore different ways to stim so I did and I realized that I stim all the time, I just had no idea that's what I was doing. Before I got diagnosed I had begun hand flapping which I hadn't done before but suddenly started to feel necessary when I was especially overwhelmed or upset. Part of what led to me getting diagnosed was that I believe I experienced burnout that resulted in a bit of loss of a few skills. I worry that that paired with the recently more obvious stimming will only serve as more proof to those around me that I'm just making it up. I feel like it was burnout and honestly feel as though I'm still experiencing it 6ish months later but even worse. At the same time I'm still doubting that I'm even autistic and that calling it burnout is just trying to find an excuse for why I'm being lazy or something.

The worst part is that I believe I'm autistic and I'm 100% okay with that, in fact I was relieved at how much it makes sense. If it wasn't for the resistance my family has towards it, I don't think I would be worrying at all or at least nothing close to this. I feel like I just gave up tonight because I self harmed for the first time in years. It's not bad, as not bad as self harming can be anyway. Not bad as in it'll heal in a day or two. But I hate that I've gotten to the point where that feels like the only solution even though I'm well aware that it's anything but a solution. I feel really guilty because my boyfriend has been struggling immensely lately with his own issues and even though he's truly incredible and so so supportive, I hate that this is now just another thing for him to be stressed out about. I know that this doesn't have to mean anything and that just because it happened once doesn't mean it has to happen again and all. But as guilty as I feel, there was a part of me that was relieved because the wound I gave myself is more than anything else I've been able to do to address the level of turmoil I have going on in me right now.

I'm terrified even posting this because I'm scared that everyone here is just going to tell me to get over myself and that I'm being dramatic. If that's the case please at least don't be mean.

Finding out I'm autistic would feel like a huge relief because now I know for sure that there's nothing wrong with me except that pretty much every single person close to me has been very upfront about the fact that they don't believe me. I feel really isolated and hopeless because I have this diagnosis now but I don't really know anything about it or how it affects me personally except for the contradictory information available online and everyone I talk to that is supposed to know what they're talking about clearly has no idea.  I had to stop seeing the psychologist who diagnosed me and every psychologist or organization I've gone too since has basically told me that I'm not autistic enough for them.

I'm in my first semester of college which I've been really struggling with because I wasn't able to get a disability verification until about two weeks ago so I've pretty much lost this semester since I'm too far behind to catch up even with their help.

So, we just got electric solar installed and we're starting to see significant savings in our electrical bill so I am really hoping that we can make these upgrades as energy efficient as possible. 

\#1 is upgrading from a single speed pump to a variable speed pump. We just got this pump a little over a year ago so it kind of sucks considering replacing it so soon but if the ROI is there then we'll do it. 

\#2 is adding a heat pump heater. We used to have a solar system we'd pump water through but those came down when we got our new roof and electric solar panels. Currently looking at the HeatWave SuperQuiet SQ225 or SQ150VS

(Bonus question; can you have a variable speed pump with a variable speed heat pump and is there any benefit or negation from combining the two?)

\#3 is adding a solar blanket on a reel. We have one end of the pool where I wouldn't mind losing walking space if the solar blanket reel is worth it. My only real concern is if we have the solar blanket out on the pool and one of my small dogs falls in, would they slip under and drown? 

\#4 and last on the list is converting to salt water. I'm ready to bite the bullet and pay someone to start maintaining my pool for me but I've read some stories that make it sound like if you convert to salt that it's much easier to maintain. Could a person like me who's often chasing my pool's balance and failing find success maintaining his own pool after converting to salt water? Would the reduction in chemicals ultimately make the cost worth while?

Sell about $200k worth of stock

Put $20k aside for taxes either in an HYSA or CD or I-Bonds (wife and I)

Put $15k aside for an emergency fund (HYSA)

Put $22.5k aside for retirement investing

Put $140k into our house

Recast our mortgage and end up with around a $400 mortgage payment

Then the plan is to put all extra money into a taxable investment index fund account and sell stock in the next opportunity to put towards house (hopefully paying it off entirely within the next 2 years). 

Once our mortgage is in this position ($400 a month) we'll be putting all available cash into investments.

78,yes,DaveRamsey,2023-01-06 04:50:08,MyBrainsPOV,Is this a proper Dave Ramsey Baby Step plan (selling company stock to hit the baby steps),"I just submitted this to the show but wanted to post here as well just in case I don't get an answer in time. I am currently in a private company purchase offer that's got 2 weeks left so that I can sell off company stock. I have about 350k in stock and about 243k of it is vested. I feel like applying the baby steps here means the following: 

1. 3 months emergency fund at least (sell $15,000 worth)
2. 15% towards retirement (my wife just turned 50 so $7k to my wife's IRA (SAH Mom) and balance to my Roth 401k (no match) (sell  $11,250 worth total). 
3. $40,000 to my house principal. After 40k the interest savings tapers off (which means if I were to put $60k towards it I'd only pay off I'd only pay off about $55k in interest and it goes down from there in a curve)
4. We are considering also selling enough to pay our mortgage for the rest of the year. We know this is not financially sound but we have a lot of financial stress in our lives and feel like it's worth it. So this would mean selling an additional \~$10k to put into a HYSA and pull from every month to pay the mortgage.

84,yes,personalfinance,2022-11-25 18:33:15,MyBrainsPOV,Giving $50k to my brother - What's the best way to do that?,"My brother is legally my foster brother. When our parents died neither had any assets worth much of anything. The only thing of value was the home which I bought outright over 20 years ago. However, I wanted to give him something and after a title lawsuit with other relatives, agent fees, etc, my wife and I decided on $50k. 

He doesn't need or want the money right now and wants me to help him get the most bang for his buck. We've looked into buying him a place to live (most likely a condo or trailer park home) but cost of living where he is is too high for $50k to make any kind of dent where he could afford the monthly payments, and he's not quite ready to move yet. 

Question #1 is do we keep this money until he's ready for it or do we gift it to him ASAP?

Question #2 is if we keep it until he's ready; how does growth work when we put it into a HYSA or CD or mutual funds etc? (he'd keep the interest not us). 

Seems like its less complicated if we gift it to him via 4 checks from my wife and myself in 2022 and 2023 and he just takes our advice on how to invest it but there's also concern of him spending it. It's a concern he is fully aware of and he wants us to help him. There is 100% transparency on everything. 

My current thought is to split the money between a HYSA and a 5 year CD. It looks like he could make between 8-11k if he left the money alone for 5 years that way.

Today the project rep reached out to me and wanted to know if I wanted to keep the leftover metal panels. It's 26g charcoal colored standing seam panels.

88,yes,AutisticAdults,2022-09-12 02:08:18,MyBrainsPOV,Identity question: Where does autism end and character and personality begin?,"How do you decide for yourself if something is because of you experiencing life through the lens of autism or because of who you are as a person? I feel like its likely a huge gray area and that everything that makes you YOU is painted with a brush that was first dipped into a bit of autistic paint and I feel like no experience can be had that isnt tinted a bit by that fact. 

But I really struggle now trying to figure out what parts of me are me and what parts are because I'm likely on the spectrum. 

I firmly believe that regardless of diagnosis that underneath it all is a person. Yes, shaped by their diagnosis, but there is a degree of personal choice and personality that shapes you regardless of your diagnosis. 

My question about myself is essentially ""who am I""? What parts of me are just me, and what parts are me covered in bruises from my diagnosis beating me down over the years? 

I take responsibility for everything that I do. But I try to give myself grace for being able to do more than I possibly would be able to do if I didnt try so hard. 

It's really weird. I dont know whether to be proud of myself of upset with myself because so many things are in the gray area.

My parents worked in a ""group home"" which was, in the 80's/90's what we called an institution that had various mentally challenged people. There was down syndrome, there was manic depressive violence, there was simply mentally challenged people. I went to the Special Olympics with these people and cheered them on as my friends. And when some of them became suddenly violent or unable to complete a task I never thought of it as a character trait. I always felt like they were buried under the burden of their condition.

So now I wonder a lot, thinking back over my life, and am having a bit of an identity crisis. Were those moments that haunt me my own responsibility and poor decisions that I made; or was I operating at a disadvantage and should be kind to myself.

It's a private company that I work for. Right now it's worth nearly $320k and by next year it should be worth over half a million dollars. In two years it could very realistically be worth over 1 million. It's very hard to walk away from this. However, I'm terrified having everything in one place that I cant even touch until they tell me I can. I am new to investing (besides accruing this stock) and am equally afraid of putting it into the stock market and have really bad FOMO. 

My biggest fear is selling stock, paying taxes on the capital gains, then taking that reduced amount and investing it elsewhere and watch it grow at less-than-even-anticipated lower rates; all while the single stock continues to skyrocket. 

I know that the right thing to do is diversify. But I cant help but feel like I'm walking away from such a huge opportunity. 

Part of me says that the current value, while high, isn't something that will significantly impact my life; especially after taxes. So maybe I just pretend it doesnt exist and cross my fingers and take that risk. The other part of me says cut and run, take control of the money and dont look back.

Prior to my MIL moving out we always had the option of one or both kids staying at home; so what I had for a car never really mattered until now. 

Both my kids are special needs and my wife has a bad knee (knee replacement and constant pain) so she cannot comfortably drive my vehicle and it's too cramped for one of my girls. 

My wife has a 2019 Honda Ridgeline and I have a 2015 Hyundai Sonata. 

I would like to keep my fuel efficiency as close to what I've currently got as possible. I dont really care about the year of the vehicle, but I do want one that's got fairly low miles on it. Like under 60k if possible but at least no worse than what I've currently got which is about 85k. The number is arbitrary really as some cars last a lot longer than others so I am not stuck on this really. 

Sure, I want a nice car, something clean and comfortable to drive. I do like my Hyundai a lot but it has some issues that worry me like door handles keep coming off  for example. 

I pretty much came down to the Honda CRV or Mazda CX-5. I like the Mazda a lot more but sounds like its smaller by enough to be significant. 

Will be trading in my car (or private sale) to put towards the new vehicle and total budget is 20-25k. Cash only. I'd need a really good argument to finance something. I will have to steal this money from some other project it's already earmarked for but it is what it is.

I have about $320k in company stock that should be double that in 2-5 years and I will be pulling about $15,000 per year minimum from that in the coming years for that 10 year plan of paying off the house. I may also take additional money out of that to transfer into more traditional and diversified investment options. 

I have never had a 401k plan. I am kind of overwhelmed by the process of choosing investments. I am trying to avoid managed accounts and paying a financial investor if possible. I chose these based on how old they were, their long term growth, and their minimal impact from the current financial dip. 

When I choose this I will divest my 15% into my company stock down to 5% so between stock and 401k I will be at 20% investing for my entire family (single income).

That's not what I'm mad about by the way lol. I just want to explain that I have not officially been diagnosed. I've taken tests online, read some stuff on here, generally been blown away having my own thoughts and feelings explained by other people as their experience of reality for the first time in my life.

This has been a short but very intense  journey for sure. 

So, I am 40 years old. I have always been an introvert. I have always felt different. Once upon a time I thought that I might possibly be God reincarnate to experience the alien human race experience. That's true.  I didn't feel special and it wasn't some megalomaniac thing. I just felt like I was a scientist or something. An observer. 

I always somehow though felt like I was normal. I felt more normal than those around me. I have always felt like the people in my life were so fucking strange. Like, what's up with these people? They have these rituals and obsessions and are so fucking mean. 

All of my inner thoughts and feelings and insecurities and weird behaviors I felt were normal. I felt like at the very most I was just more in tune with myself than the people around me. Like I was understanding how weird everything is while everyone else just floated through life oblivious. 

I do not like events or gatherings. I do not like vacations. I do not like the idea of hanging out with someone. My parents just recently died and I was very briefly sad and then that passed and now I am ok with it. I do not have friends that I hang out with after work and I wouldn't want to if I was invited. I remember being sad about being lonely when I was younger but now it is my comfort spot. 

I have my routines down to a science and sometimes, when I break them; I fall apart. Literal example: today I didn't feel comfortable backing out my driveway the way I usually do because the across-the-street-neighbor were having driveway work done and I figured ""I'm smart enough to figure out how to get to the convenience store by going a different way"" and left my street by the opposite end because I was more comfortable backing out at that angle and I got FUCKING LOST IN MY OWN NEIGHBORHOOD FOR 20 MINUTES. 

I unsuccessfully used Google maps to try to find the store I wanted to go to. I've lived here for 3 years. My maps were stuck in walk mode because at work I use walk mode to show drivers how to navigate the Space Force Base where Google doesn't let you do drive mode. I couldn't get out of it. I lost my fucking mind in my own neighborhood of 3 years  and was late to work because I initially just had to go around the block. \*sigh\*

I have honestly thought and felt that whatever this experience of mine was that it was unique to me. That these were my faults and my frustrations. 

I am the most forgetful person on the planet and it means that I am not taking the time to pay attention and that I don't care about people according to people close to me. I have no idea where anything is, what I've done prior to today, and unless you describe exactly what the thing you're looking for looks like I will not find it. Looking for a 1 gallon jug of milk but turns out you bought a quart? I will do my very fucking best and ultimately not find the quart because I was looking for a gallon.

I can drive a car and generally navigate through life but I sometimes stare at credit card machines and panic because I'm not sure which version of ""credit"" I'm supposed to choose. 

I'm afraid to buy certain things because sometimes when I do the clerk starts making assumptions and asking questions and I really dont understand why they are injecting themselves into my personal life but fuuuuuuck apparently thats how people enjoy interacting with each other. 

And I have lived 39 years thinking this was all just me. That I was weird. That I was unique. That I alone lived this way. In a way I had comfort in that because I could say to myself that I was ""off"" but passing, for the most part, and that hopefully no one ever really caught on that I was a little confused about this whole ""life thing"". I felt responsible. I tried to fix me and I used masking and mirroring to figure out to be a ""normal human being"". I fucking apologized to my core for being who I was. 

And then I tried to read a book (Look me in the eye) and a few years later took a few online tests and had my mind blown. I have lived 40 years thinking this was all me, and that I was alone with this. I'm not officially diagnosed but by this point, after these tests, after my interaction with people on reddit and conversations and  expanding my understanding of autism... I guess that I am autistic and it fucking explains EVERYTHING. 

So now I'm here feeling like a fraud because I've been a step-father to autistic kids for 10 years and never, not a single fucking time, did I ever say ""oh I know what they are going through"". And I now have the absurdity to go ""oh yeah, me too!"" I cant begin to explain the gut punch of discovering that your unique experience in life suddenly has a name, and it's a name you've struggled with in having your kids navigate through life, it's nothing like what they are dealing with, and you just have to fucking deal with that like its cement firming up around your feet as you sink into to ocean of self pity. 

My heart is breaking because I feel like I'm doing some  Munchausen syndrome shit to my kids. To be fair I think like attracts like and I am so greatful for the family that I ended up with, and I hope that I can help my kids with my perspective, but I feel like I'm a big fat phony here with this. My kids suffer so much with this in ways that I have such an advantage with that they dont have. 

And I'm fucking furious. I am so mad. I am mad at my parents. I know they knew something but they never told me. I am grateful in one hand that they ""let me grow up normal"" not knowing anything was wrong, but on the other hand it would have been so helpful to know. Then again, it was the 90s and I dont know how much help I would have gotten. 

I'm mad because I'm learning other people apparently are experiencing this pain. I wish that I was the only one on the planet feeling it. 

I'm mad because I dont know what to do next. I dont know if an official diagnosis matters. 

I'm mad because I just want this to end. I'm sick of my obsessions and how my special interests change and bother those around me and how I'm viewed as unreliable. 

I'm mad because I need to do things that are boring to me and that boring is like an end of the world feeling and it means that I cant put my special interest power into things that I dont care about but I want to care about and ultimately that hurts people that I love. 

I'm just bitter now. I used to shrug off my weirdness and try to play normal. Now I have real anger. I wake up and I'm blaming my parents in my head for not getting me help. I'm blaming my family for not accepting my crappy behavior as a side affect of whatever this is. I'm blaming myself for having side effects that affect my family. I'm just mad all the time now.  It oscillates between anger at myself and anger at those around me like a neutron bomb and I'm honestly scared because I dont know when or how this emotional response is going to end. I have never felt this emotionally unbalanced in my life. 

I just want to crest over the plateau and  find myself again. It's depressing.",1,11,11,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='vde2oj')>,,/r/adultautism/comments/vde2oj/im_mad_and_my_heart_is_breaking_and_i_dont_know/,False

I am 40 years old and life has been so frustrating and uncomfortable. I hate small talk and think it's an insane waste of time and I feel like I'm doing a little skit when I have to perform it. I am supposedly the strange one in the building but apparently neurotypical people think it's perfectly fine to just stand in front of what you need in the grocery store and you have to wait for them to perform their little ritual of looking confused as they stare at the products so close to the shelving that you have to wait for them to move for you to get the one thing you want. But I'm strange for not wanting to talk to them and ask them to move. 

Today I was in the new lunch room of the building we're going to be moving into and everyone was so close and just bumping around and I did my best to stand out of their way but everywhere I went was apparently where they wanted to go so I was constantly in their way. 

I bounce between feeling like I'm in everyone elses way and that everyone else is always in my way. I find this especially problematic in my house. Our fridge is in a doorway to our kitchen and if you use the fridge you block that route. There is another route through our house but its a bit awkward. I have considered paying to move the fridge out of that blockage area and releasing that route but sometimes I feel like that's super extreme and maybe crazy? 

I'm just so glad that I dont live in a high density area where you have to get into tightly packed trains. I see videos of that and I am just so grateful that I'm not there. 

I know that these feelings are mine alone and that I have to deal with it. I rationalize that I am having irationational reactions to these environments and that I have to calm down and distance myself from the feelings. I'm working very hard on that

But I still feel like everyone else is crazy. 

Before I ever considered I may be neurodivergent  I  figured that I was just weird or stupid. I put a lot of self-hate on myself for not belonging.  I hate attention and often feel like if I'm forced to stand up for myself that I am either extremely misunderstood and then have to step up my self-defense to make the other person super understand that the misunderstanding was a mistake (of theirs) and that  my intentions were always pure and that I am innocent and I hope that they have an ah-ha moment and absolve me of the misunderstanding (but it never happens that way and I always walk away feeling like a victim and also the perpetrator).

97,yes,personalfinance,2022-06-03 01:16:48,MyBrainsPOV,Investing in 2022 with a looming recession question,"Hi all. What would you recommend I do for investing right now, in June 2022 with a crashing market and looming recession? I have no debt except the house. I have some cash from a parent passing situation. I have no 401k. I am 40 years old. My only other assets is stock in my company that I am pretty much going to pretend doesn't exist because selling it now could pay off my house but selling it in 5 years could fund my entire retirement. 

&#x200B;

I was playing with a mortgage pay-early calculator and it looks like if I put 50k towards my house then I'd save around 50 in interest. The higher I go from there, the interest savings starts tapering off (so 100k doesn't save 100k in interest it only saves $80k). 

&#x200B;

I get that the market is ""on sale right now"" but I have zero knowledge or toes dipped in yet, so I am not necessarily scared to invest I'm just very wet behind the ears and am nervous I'll jump in too early. I was thinking maybe 50k to my mortgage and 50k into the market at ""some point"" but want to get this community's advice. 

&#x200B;

I sought out advice from a fiduciary financial advisor that I found via the Dave Ramsey Smartvestor Pro network but he wanted 2.4% which sounded batshit insane so I didn't get involved with him. I know there's strong feelings about Dave Ramsey. I am not an idol worshipper so you don't need to save me but I do think he helps a lot of people. But again, I am open to all sorts of ideas.

I'm nervous that this may be overkill for what we want for our bedroom so I wanted to ask here hoping I might save us from a mistake. Our bedroom is on the opposite end of the house as the 3 ton air handler and we often feel a little too warm in our room at night.

99,yes,AutisticAdults,2022-04-07 04:04:34,MyBrainsPOV,Safe space vehicles for day trips - thinking of going crazy here,"Hi everyone, so I have an idea to bounce off of you. We're thinking long term and trying to come up with ways to make half and full day car trips something to look forward to vs something to feel trapped in. So in this scenario lets pretend that price doesnt matter. We're considering a few options:

1. A minivan. Yaaaaay! Who doesnt love minivans? Except me and my wife? But who else?! Pro is they are much cheaper than the other options and offer plenty of space to ""feel comfortable"". The Sienna is ugly as sin but has twice the warranty. The Kia Carnival looks like an oversized badass SUV but in the videos I've seen getting into the third row seating looks hard to do. 
2. A big-ass-camper! This is actually awesome but its huge and difficult to drive. And this is kind of a lead in to a thought process we are playing with: when we get to the destination we essentially have a whole damn apartment on wheels. 
3. A tow camper! OMG so much cheaper than option 2. We could literally get my dream SUV and get a brand new towing camper for the price of a powered RV. 
4. Bigass SUV! I am leaning towards the Wagoneer but it's like twice the cost of top end minivans. 
5. Wagoneer plus towing rv! My dream combo but  obviously fucking insanely expensive. 

&#x200B;

The thought process here is to ""bring home with us"" in some fashion. Whether its some convenience and space or an outright rv that we tow along, we want to make going out not seem so much like something you want to opt out of. I have 2 autistic kids and this would be their safe space. My oldest is now 18 so she can stay by herself in the parking lot in whatever method of madness we decide on. My youngest could potentially stay with her though I'm not quite there yet. That's not a statement about my oldest it's more about leaving my youngest alone in public even if in a locked vehicle or RV. Maybe in another year or two. 

&#x200B;

Lets say this was you. Would this rock your world? Or am I not explaining this properly? So like; almost everywhere we go my oldest wants to stay in the car and my youngest generally joins her within an hour. So the idea here is to give them more than  car to go back to (minivan, rv, whatever) so they can feel super comfortable and happy, and some or all of us adults could continue shopping. A single adult may have to come back at least for now until my youngest is a bit older. I could potentially add some cameras to the rig so we can keep an eye on them remotely. 

If it werent for Walmart delivery and having our mother in law living with us we would never be able to leave the house, shop, etc. WE are so lucky we're in 2022 with modern conveniences. But even when we go out to do something fun the whole trip is a bit much. So.... 

1. we are prepared to spend more than we're comfortable spending in order to get a high luxery vehicle since it will open up travel for us. 
2. we are prepared to turn ordinary outings into camping situations if it brings some order and comfort to our kids lives
3. how would you feel with any of this?

100,yes,AutisticAdults,2022-04-06 04:50:07,MyBrainsPOV,Self-diagnosed and feeling like a fraud,"For 40 years I've done my god damn best to be a ""normal person"". I have equally desired close friendship as well as deeply dreaded it.  Eye contact conversations are my kryptonite. I just learned about the term ""masking"" and I have apparently spent my entire life learning to master it. The negative part of my performance reviews at work have always been about my personal interaction skills and I have been significantly monetarily compensated for meeting and exceeding my manager's expectations of my ability to address those concerns. I now lead a team in logistics.  

I am fucking exhausted at the end of the day mentally. The only time I feel like myself is when I drive  home and sing, and scream, and laugh until I cry.  I have been depressed for 20 years. And now here I am at 40, being sidelined with a realization that I meet a diagnosis that I feel like someone should have recognized and been like ""hey you really seem like this"".  I dont blame anyone I'm just  shocked.  

My children are autistic. We're not biologically related but I feel like a fraud ""discovering"" at 40 that I'm apparently also on the spectrum. I love my kids. I feel like them learning this is going to make them feel like I'm a Munchausen patient clinging onto their diagnosis as my own. I fear this could hurt them severely. My oldest son is accepting but he's also my kid who's most able to live on his own. I fear what this will do to my girls. They experience this so much more intense than I do. Is it even fair to say that I ""suffer"" when they are so much more affected by this than I am? 

Let me put this into my perspective: I am in mental discomfort every day. But I also am the single income for a family of 5 and we also partially support my son and his fiancée.  None of us get public assistance though my kids are on state care vs through my insurance at work. We live paycheck to paycheck this way but comfortably so. I have nothing to complain about and everything to be grateful about. 

I log into these chat rooms and I am comforted talking to people who are experiencing what I'm experiencing. But it also depresses me because a short while ago one of the things that I was grateful for was that no one else on earth had to experience life the way that I was. It just seems so unfair. I'm sorry for those experiencing life the same as me out there. 

I plan to start writing again, after 20 years, very soon. I dont know what will come of it. But I am working on moving from that unknown part of my life of 40 years and shift into the next 20-40 and try to make some sense of it and be somewhat productive. 

I'm changing therapists right now per my last therapist. She thinks her strengths dont really match my needs. I think although I liked working with her that she's right. I will be a lot more open with my next therapist and make sure I express how important some of this conversation is with her. I am kind of bummed that I'm going to miss a week but I'll make the following week worth while. I mean, I hope so. 

Thank you for those who have these subreddits and conversations. I hope to learn and grow a lot because of it.

Also, a title settlement question regarding it's impact on my tax liability.","Hey guys! I have two specific questions that I wanted to ask the community. I have a CPA that I am going to meet with but I wanted a wider set of opinions that I could work with to bring to the table for my CPA and I to discuss regarding this. 

So here is the situation: I bought a house in 1999 for $110,000. I am now selling it for $405,000. 

1. I had to settle with descendants of who I purchased the house from to clear the title. Turns out, when the husband passed away his half interest did not go to his wife. So when I bought the house from her, she didn't have the legal right to sell his half interest. I had to settle that issue by paying out a total of $30,000. It's worded in the agreement that this is a  payment of inheritance settlement. Can I add this to my basis?
2. Over 20 years have passed since I've bought the house. The roof has been replaced. The kitchen has been remodeled. I replaced the boiler pretty recently. We also replaced some of the flooring. How do I calculate this stuff without receipts? My CPA says if I over-estimate that it can just be 100% rejected which is terrifying. I am not looking to screw the government out of anything but these costs really happened over the years. 
3. It's my understanding that I can add agent fees etc so I assume that includes the over $20k that I'm about to pay during closing?
4. Regarding attorney fees that can be deducted; does that include what I had to spend to resolve this title issue? It's well over $5k so far between what I paid my lawyer and agreed to pay their lawyer. 
5. Are there any other things you can think of that get overlooked that owning a house for 20 years, but not living in it (my parents lived in it) that I can add to the basis? 

I appreciate any responses and feedback. I hope this isn't inappropriate. As I said, I do have a CPA and am working on setting up an appointment with him in the coming weeks.

103,yes,personalfinance,2022-03-12 01:38:07,MyBrainsPOV,How should I structure a monetary gift to my foster brother after our shared parents have passed away?,"Here is our story: When I was 17 years old, in 1999, my step-mother was her grandmother's POA. It was time for her grandmother to go into 24/7 care and in course of her transitioning from living in her own place to moving into elder care; I purchased her house from her (through my step-mother as POA)\*. When I was 18, I moved out of the house and went to college; and my parents fostered a child around that same time. 

I am now 40 years old and he's about half that. We didn't have much overlap, but his experience of growing up was with my parents as his parents. Now that both parents have passed, and I am about to sell the house, I am trying to figure out how best to help my foster brother out. 

The details aren't yet established on the sale of the house but I should be able to give him somewhere between $45k-60k. The original idea was to ""take care of him"". That was what my parents wanted and I am truly excited to help realize that goal.

Where he lives, it is impossible to get into literally any living situation on that small investment. You cant even get into a mobile home park with that. So, the question is; what is the best way for me to help him? Do I....

1) Just give him the money and wish him good luck.

2) Give him the money and have a structured conversation with him about how best to use it, but leave it up to him.

3) Set up a trust or a mutual fund or something else, hand it over to him, and wish him luck.

4) Take an uncomfortable amount of control over this aspect of his life and be like a ""controller of the money"" somehow? Maybe put the money into some scenario where he cant touch it for a certain amount of time. I dunno...

5) Not give him any money, for now, work on growing it under my full control and give it to him at a later date. The idea here being that supposedly me being older means I'm somehow better with money and that I'll just manage it for the next 10-20 years then give him it when ""he's more mature"" and it's much more money and much more impactful and we're all pretending that I can control this entire process and he's in an amazing place in life when I give him the money...

6) Some other idea?

&#x200B;

\* The house is 100% mine. It is not an inheritance. There is no legal requirement to share the proceeds from the sale of the house. Also; I am 100% committed to this idea. He'll get the money; I am just trying to figure out what is the best way to help him out in the long run. I came into money when I was young and I wasted a lot of it. I don't want to burden him with me being some kind of caretaker of his future, but I also don't want to take this opportunity that he has and just throw it away if there's a better option here.

I just got through several extremely difficult years, and now with the pandemic, I'm majorly struggling to stay motivated at my job. I work part time and remotely, so it's totally up to me to get my work hours done.

I just moved to a new city, so trying to get established during a pandemic has been overwhelming. Not to mention that the messaging from ""on high"" is all about ""stay away from others to keep everyone safe."" I feel guilty for feeling desperate for human, in person contact with others, like I should be able to suppress those needs because of the messaging from leaders 

I just got out of several years of difficult health issues that were extremely isolating, then over a year of some sort of post traumatic stress, and now I'm attempting to move forward in life and I feel like I'm making so little progress. I keep wanting to do this or that but lacking I dunno the willpower or energy or motivation to get up off my rear end and take action.

Well, that's not exactly true. I am getting some things done. But the things I really want to do, like play my instrument or get involved in outdoor activities or learn a new instrument - I'm trying to take steps, but find myself having a ton of trouble knowing how to deal with obstacles in the way. Some sort of paralysis.

I just want to cry. But I've spent so much time crying the last few years. I'm sick of it. And I don't know how to figure out the reasons behind why I'm having trouble with various things lately. There are so many things I want to do or see, but I feel so stuck 

And I feel so lonely. I'm making attempts to reach out, but it goes so slowly. Thankfully, I'm living with people, but its older relatives. I'm really longing for some people of all ages to talk with and live life with.

I used to have social anxiety and worked through it, but my illness has brought back some of the feelings of nervousness.

I'm not nervous to interact with other people in general. I love meeting new people and getting to know them. However, I'm nervous about navigating the social life, being socially acceptable.

I am also nervous about dating and falling in love. I've never done that before.

My ADHD always tends to exacerbate whatever feelings I have. Nervousness, excitement, happiness, sadness - whatever the emotion, my ADHD magnifies it and I experience it to an at times overwhelming degree.  I have to ""ride out the storm,"" and I'm not in control of it. This can make life fun, but it can also make it scary.

I do not deal well with uncertainty and change, and getting back into social life - and getting into dating people for the first time - might be challenging. Probably when I reach new milestones, dating people will have benefits that make the hard parts worthwhile, but it's hard to see that when you've never been there before and you feel afraid.

Can I navigate this and come out okay?

He has provided his IBAN and account name and is asking for a payment of the deposit and 1 month's rent right now by bank transfer, and I just feel uncomfortable making the transfer without having a written and signed agreement in place. In hindsight I should have at least asked to see his ID during the viewing.

He said he had recently retired and is using rent as a steady income. One of my references also let me know that he called a few hours before he sent me the offer email.

What should I do? Make the transfer and request a receipt? Only send him the deposit and wait until the lease is signed to transfer 1st month's rent? Refuse to pay anything until we have signed the lease? Request some form of ID?

Thanks in advance.

So today, I was playing on a public piano because I had time to kill. Now, the piano sounds terrible (since last week it has been broken, all the notes are sustained even when you let go of them, so if you play fast, all the notes kind of blend in.)

I was just learning this ( https://imgur.com/a/v9EbJae ) bit of a simplified version of turkish march for the first time, playing it very, very slowly and sometimes incorrectly. I have only been playing for 3.5 months (self taught) and I was fairly sleep deprived, so it was quite sloppy.

But despite that, at one point, a young girl (8ish?) walked over to me with who I assume was her younger brother and asked me if she could give me €1 because ""I play so well"". Now, I was totally embarrassed because it almost felt like a prank since I was playing so badly. So I was like ""haha I'm not playing well. I can't take that,"" but she insisted, and now I am €1 richer.

Afterwards some guy started hovering near me and when I got up to leave he was like ""gotta go? That was really nice.""

I have had a few other circumstances (albeit when I was playing better), e.g. when someone said I just made their day after I played a nice song (again, not too complex at all, since I'm new. It was actually a simplified piano version of la valse d'amelie)

It just makes me realise that you really don't have to play incredibly complex pieces to sound good. It also reminds me of how powerful music can be.",9,77,77,0.98,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='10faewz')>,,/r/piano/comments/10faewz/everyone_loves_the_piano/,False

I have read a little bit on this claim and on the surface it does seem accurate and like a reasonable reason to be hesitant of taking the COVID vaccine (at least, in the early times of the vaccine. Not so much now that plenty of time has passed to monitor its long-term effects).

Obviously drugs are different then vaccines, so I wonder how relevant this is because of that distinction.

I am not looking for arguments made with the benefit of 2 years of hindsight in terms of the COVID vaccine, more so from the POV of early COVID days.

157,yes,autism,2022-12-11 15:36:43,No_Boysenberry_7138,Had an extremely weird and unsettling experience after my yoga nidra and a dream," I am going to include lots of seemingly relevant context here, so this post is very long.

This feels like the first time I so viscerally described an experience of mine, especially such a weird one. Don't be mean. Part of me is afraid I am making no sense.

I have been doing yoga nidra (a kind of lying-down meditation) for over a year and a half now. I found it near the start of my discovery journey as an autistic, although yoga nidra is particularly relevant to me realising that dulling my physical tension is **crucial** to improving my mental health (I basically, without knowing much about autism, indepdently found what overstimulation feels and how to cope with it). As time has gone by, I have learned to do it in the exact same conditions:

* After breaking my fast at noon (I only eat from 12-8pm, for over a year), with the **exact** same meal (I wrote about this meal in my post somewhere)
* In my bed with a memory foam mattress and under a weighted blanket, with nothing but underwear and socks.
* With headphones on, but on the loosest possible configuration and with both the top of my headphones and the side of the ear cuffs resting against the pillow, to prevent them from feeling too tight on my head/ears.
* Usually in the same pose (savasana) or some variation thereof, e.g. with wrists on my belly to alleviate hand tingling/numbness (not to self-diagnose but I think I have some subclinical CTS - long story, won't go into it)

I don't do it every day, there are many times I didn't do it for weeks. But I love it. That being said, it's effects on me have changed a decent bit over time. One thing I started experiencing eventually was that I would fall asleep during yoga nidra! This was crazy to me because I can **never** take naps. Unless I am **very** sleep deprived, if I wake up at my usual time in the morning then I won't be able to fall asleep until the evening. But here I was, falling asleep for anywhere from 30-120 minutes during noon!

That being said, when I would wake up, I felt... weird. I felt like my head was very empty (mentally, but also physically, like I am light headed) - much more so than when I wake up in the morning. I also felt like I **needed** water and the freshest air possible. like the air I was breathing is dirty. My throat felt a **little** bit like I had just thrown up. It wasn't an issue, I would just get up, drink water and stand around for a bit (maybe go to the garden) and the unpleasant feeling would go away. The big benefit was that my head would (mentally) still remain empty, which would make it much easier to focus on things, particularly productive tasks. The temptation to do more instantly gratifying things like playing games, watching yt, browsing social media, etc. was very much diminished. Currently, I am writing this post on such a ""high"".

So moving to today. Today was cold. I woke up a bit chilly and was a bit cold when chilling in my room. So I decided to keep my sweater and sweatpants on while I did yoga nidra. I knew that it would be slightly more unpleasant due to the physical restriction that wearing these **and** being under a weighted blanket would bring, but I felt it was worth the extra warmth.

So I did it. I fell asleep quickly enough, and I woke up once(dogs were barking), took my headphones off, and fell back asleep.

Then I had the dream. It was more of a nightmare. The best way to describe how it felt was **suffocating**. I was meant to have my session at 12:30pm with a therapist I am attatched to but haven't seen in a few months for reasons (I am seeing someone else rn, also I have an appointment with this older therapist tomorrow irl at 12:30). So I'm like ""ok, let's start walking there"". But time accelerates, and next thing I know I've been wandering for long enough that it is actually 12:20 but I haven't gone anywhere, and the map of my town is really confusing. So, distressed, I call my mother to drive me there. At one point I consider it more efficient to get out of the car in traffic, run, and get back into it later when it catches up(lol), but that confuses my mother (she didn't see me jump out of the car, allegedly) and we waste a lot of time. A few more time-wasters later we get to what is allegedly my therapists workplace. The building looks completely different, a big apartment complex basically.

I realise that I should spare you the details of the rest of the dream, otherwise I would write for a long time. Basically, a bunch of irrational stuff happens to me and I feel like I can't think straight at all, like e.g. when I go on my phone and try to click on ""messages"" but it brings me to a foreign looking app so I can't see my appointment confirmation text. The stairs have no stairs so I can't walk up, but I also can't use the elevator. I don't know which room it is so I can't ring the buzzer. Basically I am stuck there for the rest of the dream and feel horrendous, with lots of anxiety and brain fog. I am quite confident that this was partly induced by the extra physical restraint that came with wearing stuff under my weighted blanket, in a position where it would be hard to move without doing some uninituitive sliding movements (by that I mean that e.g. I wouldn't be able to just lift my arm up and over my torso cause of the blanket, I would have to slide it somewhere)

Then I wake up. It is 2 hours after I started yoga nidra. I feel light headed and lacking energy, which is never unusual initially. But I feel those things particularly strongly. I am sort of distressed about my dream, still don't **feel** I have woken up even though I kinda know that I did. I make a voice recording noting some of the dream. As before I have the feelings including thirst and like I need fresh air, so I dress up, drink a glass of water, and go to our garden. The fresh air feels great, but I still feel weird.

Here is when I realised something weird was happening. I basically walk around my garden completely on autopilot, doing weird shaky/flappy arm movements which I never do, and it feels like the conscious, rational, ""inner monologue"" part of my brain is completely deactivated. I just spend minutese walking, sometimes standing and just staring at some rock. At one point I start hitting my head repeatedly because my gut tells me to (I have this memory of doing that when I was very young, only to be told off by my teacher). My dog doesn't seem to like it and barks a bit at me (lol), so I stop a bit and pet her.

This feels like a weirdly autistic thing, but the fact that this hasn't really happened to me in recent memory makes me sceptical of that idea. I feel like if anyone tried to approach me and ask what's wrong, I would get get very distressed and try to physically stop them, but I also felt like if I wanted to, I could have activated the more conscious, ""inner monologue"" part of my brain to help me put on a normal face and act fine.

Będąc ostatnio zdiagnozowany z autyzmem (w irlandii), próbuję komunikować moje potrzeby więcej do moich rodziców. Oni mówią płynnie po polsku i niezbyt płynnie po angielsku, a ja jestem na odwrót. Więc komunikowanie się z nimi po polsku może być trudne, ponieważ mam tendencję do bycia bardzo wybrednym i specyficznym w słowach, których używam po angielsku, więc może być bardzo trudno to przetłumaczyć.

Dlatego jestem w trakcie badania autyzmu po polsku, aby pomóc mi komunikować mój autyzm po polsku z rodzicami. Planuję również podzielić się tymi samymi przydatnymi polskimi materiałami z moimi rodzicami, ale chcę być ostrożny i nie wysyłać przypadkowo moim rodzicom (np.) blogów lub artykułów z organizacji, które mają przestarzałe i szkodliwe poglądy na temat autyzmu.

Having been recently been diagnosed with autism, I am trying to communicate my needs more to my parents. They speak fluent polish and not-so-fluent english, while I am the other way around. So communicating to them in Polish can be difficult because I tend to be very picky and specific with the words I use in English, so it can be very hard to translate that.

Therefore I am in the process of researching autism in Polish to help me communicate my autism in Polish. I plan also on sharing those same useful Polish resources to my parents, but I want to be careful and not accidentally send my parents (e.g.) blogposts or articles from organisations that hold outdated and harmful views of autism.

Therefore I am in the process of researching autism in Polish to help me communicate my autism in Polish.

I will describe what the keys are like compared to other pianos I have tried. My frame of reference is based off of:

1. My cheap €80 digital piano. It's keys were very light and so easy to press. You press them down a little bit (like 1/2 of the way down) and they make noise
2. A piano located at my local train station. The keys are much harder, and of course the harder you press the louder the noise, unlike the previous piano.

My new piano has weighted keys, but it seems rather strange in that its keys are quite light to press, more like piano 1 than 2. So to make notes louder I have to press the keys hard as if I am whacking the keys against the base of the piano. Whereas with 2 it feels more like the force is exerted evenly throughout the depression of the key if that makes sense.

Is this fine? Is there any way to sanity check that my weighted keys are working as intended? Would post a video of me playing help with this?

Thanks for reading, hope this makes sense. I am probably being paranoid for no reason lol

* Reading, or just being exposed to, lots of text at once
* Doing something physical. The more awkward, physically demanding, and novel, the more overwhelming 
* Playing video games
* Doing something that requires me to think a lot
* Sensory distractions - sound, sight, touch, taste, smell

I can avoid sensory distractions, but the other things can be very hard to avoid. The difficulty is that I also have the compulsion to do more stimulating things, because otherwise I feel kind of uncomfortable and often just bored. College often goes well for me because it gives me a chance to focus on something slow-paced for a long time, which tends to be less on the stimulating side and therefore kind of relaxing. But now that I’m out of college, and I won’t be starting work for a few months, I struggle to create that sort of external restriction on what I should do that college brings me.

Anyway, I guess my main issue is that I have an instinct for doing things that overstimulate me in spite of how shitty I feel. I didn’t struggle with overstimulation much a few years ago, but now it is an experience that really shapes how I spend my time.

I think the power system specifically is especially important here, because it allows for massive amounts of creativity and cool abilities, while also being constrained by the rules of nen. If we got a group of people who were all familiar with how nen works and the hxh universe, I feel like it would be a super fun thing to try - and battles could be really interesting. We could choose personalities, and then the DM might suggest to us what kind of abilities (based on nen type) those might correspond to. Maybe we could roll dice to determine if someone is a specialist (1 in 15 chance maybe?). I am thinking that maybe the DM could have a short one-on-one session with each character discussing what kind of abilities they can have, and the player can decide without the other players knowing. It might be fun to role play a group of characters who don't yet trust each other enough to reveal the entirety of their abilities.

As for the background of campaign, a simple one could probably be based in a game just like greed island - that would make building a campaign much easier I feel. Although at the same time, it would add an extra layer of complexity due to all the different cards that exist/ that you could make up. We could take inspiration from pre existing abilities or even characters (that would help since we have drawings already available for pre existing characters). 

The players would presumably be familiar with the hxh universe quite well (I watched the anime twice, read the remaining manga, scoured the wiki a decent bit, and have watched plenty of videos about hxh). Because otherwise I feel like it would be a headache to explain nen. People who know about nen might have more creativity when it comes to their abilities, and more importantly they would have a better understanding of how other people's abilities might work, which would make battles work more smoothly.

Obviously since I am super new to D&D I wouldn't be able to DM a campaign yet, especially one as creative as a hxh campaign. Since coming up with cool hxh fights and rules (specifically in a way that works in the D&D combat system), I wonder if having 2 DMs would be a good idea.

2. Cottage cheese with banana and cinnamon.

Then of course I add a bunch of cinnamon and mix it in with my fork. This takes longer than assembling the wrap, overall between 5 and 10 minutes.

I was assigned my first workload today, and I emailed my boss asking a clarifying question about exactly what all she wanted my notes on. I explained that I didn't want to offend anyone by overstepping beyond my jurisdiction and making unwelcome suggestions.

She responded by telling me to go ahead and include any suggestions I felt may improve things, and when I thanked her she replied ""You are so great!  😊"". I'm not really sure if I'm supposed to respond to that, and if I am I have no idea what to say.

I know she probably has a friendlier than normal tone with me because she's (sort of) known me since I was younger (via occasional company holiday parties with my dad, etc), but that compliment just feels so broad that I really don't know how to address it gracefully.

What do you think I should do? Does this warrant a response, and if so, how might I go about wording it?

He's a selfless and doting partner, and it genuinely seems like the only thing he's truly aware of wanting is for *me* to be happy.

Since I love and care about him I have been trying to help him connect more with what *he* actually wants, for himself. He's extremely resistant to making any sort of decision, however, and especially anything along the lines of ""What would you like to do/eat/watch/etc"".

Sometimes we run into the issue that he is just trying to guess what I want with his answers, but I've realized also that he genuinely can't imagine a real answer to the question. He seems just incapable of thinking of himself.

I would just choose something for him to come along with and see if he likes it, but most of the time what I want to do is something very individual, such as work on a project, play a video game, or read. Sometimes that's fine and he'll just hang out and entertain himself, but I don't want that to become the standard. I could really use some advice for helping him figure out what would make him happy, or even just suggestions for an approach to the issue that is more likely to at least lead to something he may actually enjoy.",12,9,9,0.92,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13p7tl6')>,,/r/Enneagram/comments/13p7tl6/tips_for_helping_a_9_out_of_a_hole_of_indecision/,False

After 2 years of depressing and infruriating battles with corporate insurers I'd basically forced myself to never get my hopes up about anything top surgery related.

I got on a new insurance plan that I know will cover it, but I still refused to get too excited. I booked a consult, stayed level-headed. When I went to the consult, though, and the surgeon told me I'm a prime candidate for excellent results, and that my surgery date could be as soon as 3 MONTHS FROM NOW... Y'all. I can't even put it into words.

I'm still trying to stay cool, because you never know. Until it's actually finally truly done, then I'll celebrate no holds barred. For now though, I'm feeling hopeful and happy for the first time in years. I can actually see a future.for myself again, one where my body matches the rest of me.

So I just had to let it out here because idk who else could possibly understand how much this means to me!!

196,yes,TransMasc,2023-03-19 21:18:37,serromani,Chest dysphoria is literally killing me and I don't know what to do anymore. [Vent],"Sorry if this post comes across sort of 'woe is me'. I generally try not to be one of those people, but this whole situation just sucks and I need to let it out somewhere where it can hopefully be understood.

I've got major chest dysphoria (obviously). Before I knew I wanted T, I *knew* I wanted top surgery. Unfortunately, certain shitty circumstances prevented me from having access to it. [TW: SI] >!Not knowing if or when I could ever get surgery led to the worst depression I've ever gone through, and I made an attempt on my own life for the first time.!<

Finally, I'm now in a position where I might actually be able to get it covered. I immediately called up a nearby surgeon with a relatively short wait-list and asked for a consult. They told me they'd just need a letter of support from both my HRT prescriber and a therapist before moving forward.

I got the letter from my prescriber easily, but my therapist was taking a while. When I asked her about it in session, she told me that she 'couldn't sign in good conscience' until she knew for sure that 'all mental health conditions were under control'. I'm currently being assessed for a very stigmatized disorder, and have already been informally told the likelihood I have it is very high. My therapist wants to contact this specialist to make sure I have it 'under control'-- while I'm literally in the middle of even finding out it exists.

I understand her concern, I genuinely do. I know there's potentially very serious liability for her if she signs. But she's been with me through the depression, through the attempt, and she knows it was all directly due to my dysphoria. In all the time we've worked together, I've never once said or done anything to suggest I may ever change my mind about surgery.

Things have gotten so bad I've basically become a shut-in. I can't leave the house or be around people if I'm not binding. Unfortunately, my chest is fairly large comparable to my frame, so even when I am binding I'm still extremely self-conscious. I go through ridiculous amounts of trans tape, and every time I have to apply it in front of a mirror is pure torture. I start shaking all over and end up just dissociating tf out of my body through most of it.

I feel so lost and terrified. I'm going to try to contact other places to try to get a letter in case my therapist ends up refusing. I started a GoFundMe a long time ago, hoping I could just do it out of pocket, but unfortunately I never reached my goal. If I find out I have to wait *again,* or that possibly I may never be able to get it based on this diagnosis-- I just don't know how I could handle that. I just want to feel okay in my skin for once in my life, and not crippled by shame and disgust at the sight of my own body.

197,yes,TopSurgery,2023-03-08 22:21:05,serromani,Anyone here have experience with Dr. Iteld in Chicago?,"I've been actively trying to get top surgery for about 2 years now, and I'm so fucking excited to say that I think I'm FINALLY on my way to really making it happen.

I know that quality results are the ultimate goal, but tbh at this point I'm also really hoping to get this surgery done ASAP. I'm in my friend's bridal party and the wedding is almost exactly 1 year from now, and if I could have a flat chest for the first time I wear a suit... That would make me the happiest guy in the world.

I've been looking at Dr. Iteld in Chicago, because a) he's nearby, b) he seems pretty affordable, and c) his staff has said that they're pretty confident they could get me into the OR within a little under a year. He doesn't have many photos of results for top surgery that I can find, though (the only one I could find was actually a post in this sub- the results looked great though).

So, does anyone have any experience with him that they could share with me? Is there any reason I should be wary?

198,yes,gaytransguys,2023-03-04 19:14:59,serromani,How can I be read less as a straight guy??,"So I'm technically bisexual, but I've got a pretty strong preference for men. My personality and mannerisms are pretty 'generically masculine', at least when I'm just getting to know someone. I'm pretty quiet and closed off, and when I speak I don't have much inflection or anything.

Also, the way I dress is pretty 'heterodudecore' lmao. It's partially because I'm still in a bit of an awkward androgynous-ish phase in my transition (or at least I feel like I am, even though I'm never really read as female anymore), so presenting more stereotypically masc is a bit of a safety blanket. Also, I just kinda like dressing like this I guess? It's no different to how I dressed before-- comfy tees, flannels, jeans, sweats, sneakers, etc.

Problem is, pretty much everyone seems to just assume I'm a straight guy. Which is fine in most situations, I don't mind when the barber asks if I got a gf or whatever, but it's a bummer when I go to LGBTQ spaces and people don't seem to consider that I'm queer myself.

Last night I went a LGBTQ night club for the first time, and literally the only person who came and danced with me was a girl (and she kissed me too afterwards, which was sweet and she was very pretty and nice but that's just not really what I was looking for there). It probably didn't help that I was there with my femme-leaning cis lesbian friend, so from the outside we might have looked like a couple.

Anyone else have this problem? How can I subtly hint at the fact I'm not straight, without having to dress or speak in a way I don't want to? I'll admit I'm still pretty insecure and have a lot of social anxiety, and acting like a cool-headed masc guy is a really comforting mask to get me through it. But I just want guys to take interest in me lol, or at least see me as an option. What do I do??

ETA: Just realized this might be relevant, but I'm autistic haha. Having a blank/straight face, monotone voice, and not using many gestures is kind of just how I am.

200,yes,NonBinary,2023-02-26 23:08:27,serromani,Advice on prosthetics for AFABs in the bedroom? [NSFW],"TW for pretty detailed descriptions of sex stuff (sorry 😬).

I'm transmasc, and I'd really like to be able to top/penetrate more during sex than I do currently. It's something I always fantasize about, but so far reality has really not measured up.

I've tried a few different options, but none of them were quite right. The first was just a standard strap-on with a harness, but it was so hard to get a feel for it. The angle felt awkward and unnatural, I just couldn't get into a groove or anything, and since it didn't give me any actual sensation it was ultimately not really worth the effort.

Next I tried a strapless strap-on (that you insert into your own front hole so you don't have to use a harness), and I did actually like that one better. It was a lot more intuitive to use because I could actually feel it, so the movement was a lot easier to get the hang of. I wasn't a huge fan of the sensation it provided me though- it wasn't exactly stimulating or anything. It didn't feel bad, necessarily, but it didn't really feel good either.

So next I tried to look for products specifically designed for transmasc folks to use. I don't have a big budget for this kind of stuff, so I got something on the cheaper end to start with. It was off some Etsy shop, and it doubled as an STP/packer but had a rod insert that was meant to feel good on my bits too. Unfortunately, it ended up being basically same as the first strap-on in terms of awkwardness/difficulty to use, and there was barely any benefit for me in terms of stimulation (just kinda... Some rubbing, I guess).

I'm really looking for recommendations for what I should try next, and what sort of expectations I can really have. I'm starting to think maybe I should just go back to the second option I tried, because at least I felt I could perform okay with that one. But it would be really cool to find something that also actually made me feel good at the same time.

I'm trans(masc) myself, but I didn't figure that out about myself until my mid 20s so I've never had the experience of being a knowingly closeted trans teenager. I'm hoping others here can give me some tips or pointers for how to support my cousin while she's still a minor living with homo/transphobes.

She just came out to me privately a week ago. She's chosen a name and talked to me a bit about what her hopes for the future are regarding transition, etc. In the meantime, though, she lives with her mom/my aunt, who is honestly an awful parent (runs in the family unfortunately). Her mom's dating a very ""traditional"" guy who is constantly going on phobic rants to her while he drives her to and from school.

She has to sit and listen to him go on and on about how being gay and/or trans is the work of the devil, and that she (my cousin) just needs God in her life, which is what he's gonna do for her. She's not out to family other than me and my sister (for obvious reasons), but her mom has always been on her case for ""acting so feminine"", so it seems like she's recruited her bf to teach her how to be a ""real man"".

I'm really worried they'll get word of her identity via my sister, who's a religious fanatic and bigot herself. Idk why she chose to come out to her at all honestly (maybe because they're a little closer in age I guess), but of course that's her choice. Either way, it's done now.

I guess I just want to ask what I can do to be of maximum support for her? If you were a teen in this situation, what would have been the most helpful for you? I stay in touch with her daily and am always affirming, and always tell her that the BS her mom's bf and my sister spout at her isn't true. If her mom finds out and she's kicked out or something, I'll make sure she has somewhere to go and is provided for (I can probably take her in myself).

Other than that, though, is there anything I'm missing that could help her stay strong for these last couple of years that she's under their thumb?",6,10,10,0.99,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='113cr8b')>,,/r/trans/comments/113cr8b/in_need_of_tips_for_supporting_my_cousin_16mtf/,False

I only got 2 comments before I deactivated the entire account. ""1st was better"" and ""down grade"".

I know how pathetic it is to let stupid internet comments get to me like this, especially when I practically invited them myself by making that post. But I'm deeply, deeply insecure about no longer being ""pretty"", and those comments just sort of drove in the nail that was already lodged in.

My husband is straight. I'm bisexual. We got married in 2019, before my egg cracked. When I finally confronted my non-cisness in 2021, I was absolutely terrified of losing him as a result... Which I basically did.

We're still married, he says he still loves me... But he's not attracted to me anymore. He's not even a little heteroflexible, there is nothing about masculinity that he is attracted to whatsoever. He says I'm still a ""beautiful person"", and he doesn't want to lose me, but it's obvious our relationship will never be what it was-- what I had hoped it would be for the rest of our lives.

I've got boatloads of trauma going back to early childhood regarding my appearance. By age four I had literally, explicitly been taught that if I weren't pretty/cute enough, I had no value to anyone. Taking this leap into transitioning, letting go of the feminine appeal that I had clung to for survival my entire life, was the biggest risk I'd ever taken. Now all of the fears that kept me clinging to it for so long have come true.

I genuinely feel like I have no value in the world anymore. I didn't feel like I had much before, but at least I was pretty. That was enough to make people tolerate my presence. Now, I don't even have that.

I'm disabled and unemployed. I've never been able to hold down a job for too long, and therefore don't really have an established career.

I went to college briefly (about 2 years) for creative writing, but had to drop out because of the above mentioned health issues. However, I'm still pretty good at writing I guess (based on third party feedback at least).

I have a lot of fairly unique identity perspectives, mostly on mental health/neurodiversity (Autism/ADHD) and LGBTQ+ issues.

I've spoken publicly a few times about these things, mostly through the church I used to attend, but I am consistently told that I have a ""real gift"" for public speaking. I really don't know what that means exactly, but since so many people make such a point of bringing it up to me (even years after I last spoke), I figure it must be something I could make use of in some way.

So my question is, what can I possibly do with this combination of strengths? I'm really not able to keep up a normal 9-5 job at this time, but I do want to be able contribute in some way. I have no idea where one would look for a job to just... Make speeches, I guess?

Any advice or guidance would be really appreciated. Thank you.

209,yes,CPTSD_NSCommunity,2023-01-01 18:18:46,serromani,Is there anything different I need to know about healing now that I understand I actually underwent child torture?,"I recently realized that many of my experiences in childhood actually fall under the definition of ""child torture"" rather than abuse. This is the passage in a recent article I read that defined the difference for me:

""The authors of the study argue that torture contrasts with other forms of child abuse, which usually result from episodic unchecked anger or a loss of self-control in a person in charge of a child. Torture is more prolonged and designed to establish domination and control over a child’s psyche. Torture is carried out to physically and psychologically 'break' someone.""

[Full article here.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/slightly-blighty/201801/the-psychology-child-torture%3famp)

Essentially, it boils down to the difference between a parent getting angry and lashing out at a child versus them enacting a more complicated, pre-meditated plan over time designed to inflict harm and gain psychological and/or physical control.

My story does not align exactly with most descriptions of child torture (since it was not enacted on me by a parent/parents), but there's no denying that it was very systematic and my abuser was successful in ""breaking"" me. Many of my deepest core beliefs about myself were instilled through torture.

Now that I realize there is something of a difference between what I went through and other, more well-known forms of child abuse, I'm wondering if maybe there is a specific approach to healing that would benefit me more. Perhaps some resources that deal with this more specifically, or certain therapy modalities that may be more beneficial?

I apologize if this is a stupid question or if it comes across as insensitive in any way. I know that all abuse is evil and all survivors deserve the same amount of love and healing. I am just wondering if there is anything I can do with this new information to help me heal more, since I have been on this journey for a few years now and I'm feeling quite stuck.

As a child/teenager, I resembled more of an 8 than a 5. I grew up in an abusive home and very much took it upon myself to ""fight back"" and try to protect my younger sister.

However, life continued to not treat me so well, and over time I retreated more and more from the world. My strategy of pushing back against the world had gotten me nowhere, so I became passive and isolated. I have always been an intellectually-oriented person, so retreating to the sidelines, studying, and observing became my MO.

I relate heavily to the core fears and desires of a 5, but I am wondering if I have been confusing my need for competency as simply my adopted strategy for achieving the autonomy and control that I have always wanted (and never had).

212,yes,CPTSD,2022-12-12 22:37:49,serromani,How can I make my first ever Christmas alone not be completely soul-crushing?,"Growing up, every year we would have the entire family over for Christmas brunch. It was my favorite day of the year. Since finding out I had C-PTSD, unpacking all of the trauma, and snapping out of the gaslight fog that my parents had me in, I have gone very LC.

Last year was the first year I did not do Christmas with them, and it was hard. Instead, I spent it with my husband and his family, which at least was nice and kept my mind off of it.

Earlier this year, however, I tried to leave my husband. Our relationship had been deteriorating for a long time and he began treating me very poorly. I ended up failing to support myself on my own, though, and after 3 months of homelessness I came back.

His family had soured to me long before I left (for complicated and problematic reasons), and him refusing to defend me to them was actually the straw that broke the camel's back. I was ripped into by his sister for having a panic attack at her wedding shower, and when I asked him to say something to help me he said that he ""would never choose me over his family"".

Things here are... Complicated. I don't know where we stand, if things will change, or anything. All I know is that for now I depend on him letting me live here. Obviously, I'm not expecting to be invited to Christmas. I wasn't invited to Thanksgiving, and he spent it with his family.

What can I do on Christmas day to not get sucked into a depressive spiral? When I was all alone on Thanksgiving, I felt so worthless and miserable.

213,yes,Enneagram,2022-12-11 04:06:44,serromani,I just realized that the niche topic that I feel like I need to master before I can begin living my life is... Myself.,"I'm a 5w4 sx/so.

I've been reading *The Wisdom of the Enneagram* for the first time, and I just had possibly the most significant realization in my journey with the enneagram.

The part that made it click was when the authors discuss 5s who get stuck in ""preparation mode"", refusing to actually move forward and engage in life because they feel they don't yet have mastery of their chosen field-- and without that mastery, they feel they won't be able to survive the real world.

I've never completely jived with the concept of needing to have complete mastery over one particular domain, despite relating deeply to everything else about being a 5. But after reading their take on this phenomenon, it dawned on me that the domain I have been obsessively studying and attempting to understand to the fullest extent possible is *myself.*

I have autism, ADHD, and a tremendous amount of trauma that has resulted in C-PTSD and dissociative issues. I did not know any of this about myself until a couple of years ago, at age 26, when I burned out and was sent for a neuropsychological evaluation. Since then, I have completely withdrawn from the world. I have not been able to consistently hold down a job, all of my relationships fell apart, and I rarely even leave my home anymore.

I finally understand what has been holding me back from any attempt to reconnect: I feel as though I do not understand myself and my own brain enough to navigate the world without accruing further trauma. Instead I stay at home and research psychology and neurobiology, diving deeper into specific areas of autism/ADHD/trauma research to uncover whatever information I can to just figure out *how to handle being me.*

I don't really know what to do with this realization. On the one hand, it's good to finally be aware of what has me feeling so unbelievably stuck. On the other, I can't think of how I can ever possibly move past this. I don't feel safe operating outside of my understanding, and when the thing I don't understand is *myself* there is no escaping that sense of unsafety.

I'm not sure exactly what I'm hoping to get out of this post, but as I have no one else to share this revelation with I felt it may be productive to put it here.

I've begun reading Janina Fisher's book ""Healing the Fragmented Selves of Trauma Survivors"" to understand more about this phenomenon and how to move forward. It's extremely informative and helpful so far, but I'm not going to lie... I'm sort of scared about what this means for me.

Do you feel like that plays a role in your typology at all?,"While reading into the types and figuring out that I was a 5, I couldn't help but think that quite a lot of other autistic/neurodivergent folks must relate to feeling that they'll be depleted by other people. Interacting with others is not only draining to me, it can also feel like navigating a minefield when it's so incredibly easy for wires to get crossed and misunderstandings to arise (seemingly) out of nowhere. I feel like the conclusion that engaging with others takes more energy than it's often worth is, frankly, a pretty logical and realistic one for me personally.

I struggle a lot with the idea that, as 5s, our growth path is supposed to include ""learning that we will not be depleted by others"", when that is in fact quite a reality for me. Too much socialization will always leave me feeling spent, and a huge part of my growth as a person has in fact been a process of learning to put up *more* boundaries to ensure that I'm not completely sucked dry. I'm sure there are many neurotypical 5s out there who could make adjustments to their thinking and lifestyle in such a way that they wouldn't need to worry about becoming overwhelmed by others, but I don't know whether or not that is something that I can achieve as an autistic person.

216,yes,AutismInWomen,2022-12-02 17:30:12,serromani,It's so distressing being back in what used to be my home. [Vent],"Sorry for this vent, I just needed to let it out somewhere where I feel like people might understand why it's so hard.

My relationship with my husband became pretty toxic and unhealthy over the past couple of years, especially after I was diagnosed with autism and stated trying to unmask. In August of this year, I tried to leave and strike out on my own. First I was accepted to a DV shelter, but the shared environment was so overwhelming that I quickly left. I spent the next 3 months living out of my car and various cheap hotel rooms trying to get on my feet.

Unfortunately, I failed, and I had to move back in with my spouse. Our relationship is very complicated still, but he's trying to support me in the ways he can and I'm at least grateful to have an actual address again. 

But while I was gone, he apparently decided to take ALL of my things and just dump them haphazardly into spare rooms we never go in. This is a huge 3-bedroom, 3-bathroom home (completely his idea, completely in his name), and it's already a toxic dump because he has ADHD and depression and hasn't cleaned a thing since we moved in 3 years ago. Now, almost every single item I own is buried in a giant pile in a little room where the door is kept closed.

I can't find anything, and just looking at my whole life swept up and tossed away is so overwhelming and depressing that I rarely try. I rotate wearing just the clothes I've kept with me in my car because it sucks so much to rummage through everything to find something to wear. All of my books, my journals, my crafting supplies, my favorite stuffed animals... All laying in a glorified landfill with the door shut to hide them from view.

It's so hard readjusting to being back here. This place was never all that great for me, but it was the closest thing to a home that I've ever had. Now it's just a dirty, empty shell. I'm grateful to get to sleep in the same place every night again, but it can be so depressing and so incredibly overwhelming at times. I just want to cry.

My spouse gets angry or frustrated fairly often, and I always know about it since he doesn't really try to hide it. He'll sigh loudly, sort of slam things around a bit, mutter curse words, and if I try to talk to him when he's in this mood he'll be very short with me.

My mother did (does) all of this as well, albeit to a much more extreme extent. It was how I could tell I needed to stay away-- once she was angry about something, it would escalate like this until she was throwing things, screaming, and lashing out at anyone who came near.

Perhaps because of the environment I grew up in, I developed the idea that anger is an emotion that should be carefully controlled as much as possible. When I'm angry, I do my best not to express it to or around anyone else unless there is very good reason. I thought this was normal and healthy. However, my spouse has said that he has a right to express how he feels, and he shouldn't have to feel bad for feeling frustrated. He actually hates when I am sad or anxious (it makes him react angrily), and when we have argued in the past about it I have said much the same thing about my emotions (that I shouldn't have to feel bad for having them).

So, I was wondering if there really is any difference between expressing sadness or anxiety (such as by having a sad expression, crying, or communicating a worry) and expressing frustration or anger. I feel as though acting angry can be scary and damaging to others, which is why I feel it's something to work out privately when at all possible, but my spouse clearly has a negative reaction to other emotions-- so is either one of us really ""wrong"" or ""right"" to express these things in front of the other?",2,3,3,0.71,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='zaqe88')>,,/r/askatherapist/comments/zaqe88/is_it_okay_to_express_anger_in_front_of_other/,False

Only recently, I've been missing expressing my femininity so much. I miss makeup, flowy clothes, and bright colors. But every time I tried to experiment, I would immediately get she/her'd, and that just hurt too much. So I shut down that side of me.

More than any of that, though, I missed being comfortable in my skin. I've always had dysphoria, but trying so hard to pass as male just made it worse. I started packing for the sake of passing, and it just made me feel weird. I didn't like having a bulge in my pants any more than I like having two bulges on my chest. I don't want to have to add characteristics of a different sex, I just want to lose the ones I have from my AGAB.

All of this has just made me realize how much neither binary gender really fits me. Being seen as a guy is only euphoric in the sense that I feel like I accomplished some great espionage-- it doesn't make me feel any more seen than being viewed as a woman. It's less uncomfortable, sure, but it's not me.

I want so badly to escape gender altogether. All I've ever wanted is to just be *me*, to be recognized and known by others as the person I am, and not some cardboard cutout of whatever preconceived conceptions they have about me based on where I do and don't bulge. These ideas of gender are too restrictive for me, because I am so much more than either of them. I just wish the rest of the world could see that, and stop trying to force me into boxes that will never fit me.",16,244,244,0.99,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='yzfpkr')>,,/r/NonBinaryTalk/comments/yzfpkr/living_stealth_as_a_guy_has_made_me_realize_just/,False

230,yes,TransMasc,2022-11-10 23:19:27,serromani,Is there a non-creepy way to compliment women as a (presumed cishet) man?,"I really enjoy giving people compliments and always have. Recently, I've started passing in certain contexts, and there are people in my life who only know me as a guy who they assume is cis and straight. This is pretty cool in a lot of ways, but I've been very conscious of the fact that what I do and say is seen through a very different lens now.

I miss complimenting women so much! I know that probably sounds weird, but I used to just live for those little moments of connection when I would tell someone her outfit is totally banging and she'd light up in smiles. Nowadays if I were to try to tell a girl she completely nailed her makeup, it would most likely come off as trying to hit on her and might make her uncomfortable.

Is it better just to keep my mouth shut, or maybe only give compliments that aren't based on anything to do with physical appearance? I'm more than happy to give those of course, but when you're just interacting with someone briefly it can be hard to work that into the conversation, haha. It used to be so easy to give people a quick cheer up by commenting on her shoes or something.

Just curious if any of y'all have come up with a solution for this, or if I should just try harder to keep my well-intentioned thoughts to myself. 😅

ETA: I don't know if this needs clarifying but I will just in case: I am not actually trying to hit on anyone, haha.

All I know is that last night I had a flashback to how I felt in the final months-year of things with my husband, and if I'm flashing back to it that means it has to have hurt me, right?

Things were complicated. He never meant to hurt me, but he don't listen to me when I begged him to understand. He was pretty unkind to me for being autistic, having CPTSD, and being trans/NB (after I came out), but never overtly. He was just sort of quietly ashamed of me and would only say the really negative things when confronted.

He also had (has) 100% control of the finances and wouldn't give it up. I was out of work for a couple of years from a bad relapse/burnout, and I never got access to any bank accounts or credit cards. I had to ask him directly for any money and he would decide if I could have it. Sometimes he would say no, even for things like groceries that I needed, and I'd go hungry.

But also he says he loves me and he supports me more than anyone else ever has in my life. He pays for things I need a lot of the time if I can't. He comforts me the best he can when I'm overwhelmed. I'm so confused because sometimes he acts like we have a future together, but I know we don't. His family turned on me and he already told me months ago he would never choose me over them or even say anything to them for mistreating me.

I'm just very confused and disoriented. He is nicer to me than anyone else but also can be very unintentionally cruel. Last night I had a flashback to when I was living with him and I couldn't figure out how to leave him, and I would sit in the house feeling like a prisoner, plotting how to sneak away.

238,yes,raisedbynarcissists,2022-09-01 15:49:34,SakuraNightGlow,Vent About My Mom and My Thoughts On What To Do,"So, I'm 19 and have lived with my nmom ever since. I think I'm just going to let out everything I feel about her and what I remember.
So this woman was apparently supposed to be a child psychologist, she studied 2 years of it yet she acts nothing like a decently compassionate and caring parent. She's both emotionally and physically abused me my entire life, instances I don't remember that she for some reason told me and others I can never forget.
When I was a baby, I was pretty chatty according to my family. And I guess I was too chatty for my mom. Because one day she said she got so annoyed with my talking that she punched me hard enough to break my nose. I don't know how that wasn't an instant indicator you weren't ready to raise another human being if you can't even prevent yourself from breaking your baby's nose but alright :) From what I remember she also said she lied about how my nose got broken because idk who would just let that slide.
And then I got older. For the most part she was okay until I started to become more shy and reserved. She always thought something was wrong with me and still does for my sudden change in personality. But by that point she was already becoming abusive and only reason why I assume she did is because of my shift in personality. I was also ""lucky"" enough to be her golden child, I always got amazing grades and behaved well in school and I still do my best to keep that up now just because I'm so used to it. But through that came all the screaming and degrading if I got any grade lower than an A. I've always hated when this woman told me ""Always aim to do your best. If you can get a 90, go for a 95 next time! And next time get 100!"" No. That's nearly impossible please shut up.
But back to her thinking something was wrong with me because I started becoming shy. She took it upon herself to enlist me in school therapy. And that was the worst mistake she could have done and it's what made me realize she was abusing me. I was casually talking to my therapist about some stuff that happens at home and remarked certain things she's done. Like yelling at me, degrading me, throwing objects at me including cleaning liquids. My therapist reasonably got nervous and calls CPS. I got nervous since knowing eventually they would come and told my mom. And my god this woman put on a damn show because she started crying, asking me why I did this to her and if I hate her. Man was I so unaware of what she's done to me it makes me furious now, and she used that to her advantage before. The social worker sadly found nothing wrong. After that, my mom went from being so sad I did this to damning me to hell. She thought I called the social worker, and claimed something like that stays on your record (I really hope it does now) and she told my entire family how I called CPS on her and thank goodness they weren't around that often by then because then it would have gone worse. But sadly I know how that would have gone now.
But I was devastated and this is really where her abuse began to shine towards me.
She immediately took me out of therapy, started to continuously talk me down and make me feel miserable on purpose, and physically abused me constantly. I remember her lifting a chair, about to throw it onto me before I screamed and begged her to leave me alone, but before that she was screaming and yelling at me and my dad was in the same room and did NOTHING until that moment. Which he always does, nothing. And all he did was just tell her to calm down. Same with an instance of her literally choking me, which she did 3 times in total in my life, and my dad was around for 2 of those times and again. Nothing. I had to push her off every single time and lock myself in my room. So yeah, lovely middle school experience. Made my anxiety form and skyrocket and I would have panic attacks every time I thought she'd hurt me.
She then placed me in therapy with a therapist who always took her side. I forgot how I stopped attending that therapy but good fucking riddance I hate that therapist. And then I was placed in therapy to a place closer to our new apartment. Both my therapists there were lovely. Yet the first one had to go. Because she too called CPS after I told her about the second time my mom tried to choke me which was some days before my session, and how my dad did nothing and just told this she beast to relax, as if that's going to do anything. And that time I was hysterical, begging my therapist to not call and I didn't want to go home after she made the call. I was too scared because the last time this happened I got horribly abused. And the same happened. Except this time, my family was strung along. Constantly demanding to talk to me. Constant accusing and belittling from nearly everyone, saying I deserve to feel horrible for what I apparently did because I guess I made the call and wasn't horrified for my life at the thought that I was going to be in a living hell for the next months? All of this for confiding in someone that she fucking choked me, and I'm told I'm the bad guy. Best example is one of my half siblings from my dad's side (because he's left multiple families) and said half sibling comparing her situation to mine, talking up my mom and how great of a parent she is. Even went through my phone to find something?? Idk what because all I do is talk to the little friends I have in there. I tried going to sleep to just constantly hear her ask if I'm still awake and I thought she was going to try understanding me but every time, she would use that to continue to talk shit about me and how horrible and stupid I am. Thanks so much for making my anxiety flare at hearing the words you used to describe me, now I never spoke to you since. So yeah, therapists changed and I regret leaving my most recent one. I loved her a lot and she was very sweet and comforting to me. My mom hated her because she made me feel safe but eventually she has no say in taking me out of therapy because I was an adult and I got to chose when to leave. And leaving therapy was my decision because I was finally getting better. But now it's getting bad again. Since then my mom broke one of my fingers, choked me AGAIN and in front of my sister this time who was paralyzed in fear. I actually had to claw at my mom because pushing her off wasn't enough and she took A PICTURE saying *I* abused her and that she could take me to court for that?? I deleted the picture of course but the audacity she has to physically assault me, I defend myself, and she says I hurt her. And then the most recent things that happened.
She was off on vacation to DR. And it was those times where she was nicest to me. When I was nowhere near her. And then when I came over for my vacation, which I could barely call one because I was busy with college transferring issues and so much emailing and video calls half of the time. Right before we went to a resort my dad was fighting with my sister and then he all of a sudden wanted to include me in it. I got angry and then my mom comes in the room asking me why I'm yelling across the hall to him and I simply said ""You constantly yell at me when we live in an apartment complex where vents are connected to other apartments. People always hear you screaming. But we're in a house, who's going to hear me screaming?"" And she shut up thankfully. Oh yeah and she also mentioned how me and my sister have been ruining our vacation when that was literally the first time we ever ""acted out""? Okay then. And then the day we left back to our city.
An uncle came over and was going to leave as I was just waking up. I was really tired and trying to wake myself up and my mom took that as being rude I guess because after he left she said ""Don't worry, I know how much you hate it here. You're never coming back."" And I got just fed up by that point. I came into her room and was constantly asking her why does she hate me so much? Why does she always assume the worst of me? Why does she think a normal person can simply change their demeanors in a flash like her two faced self?? She just kept telling me I'm insane and crazy and odious, her favorite word to call me. Then eventually I said ""This is why we can never be on the same page. You assume the worst of me and all I do is try and try to fix our relationship as mother and daughter. That therapist you took me to, thinking those kids who bullied me were the problem? Yeah remember she told you, YOU need to get your act together and stop making me feel like shit! What is your problem with me?!"" ""How's about you just stop trying to 'fix' things, because I will never understand you.""
After that, it was the first time I wondered why I was born and thought that if I didn't have friends who cared about me, there would be no reason for me to go on. And I cried. A lot.
And after I calmed down I just decided you know what. Fine.
I'm not talking to her anymore unless I need to bring something up. I'm not going to say hi to her or wish her good night. I'm going to ignore her everytime she's in my room. I can't stand caring about her opinion because if I keep doing that to myself, I'm actually going to kill myself.
But things are going to get better.
Because the university I transferred to is 3/4 hours away from this toxic household. I know I'll be so much happier next semester.
As for my sister, at first I felt guilty leaving her behind. But she's clearly the favorite in both my parents eyes, but especially my mom's. Because she never laid a hand on her. There have been times my dad has hurt me too. But never my sister. I'm not jealous of her, we're very close, as close as siblings could be, as I had to be her emotional and well, parental support because none of our actual parents wanted to do their jobs outside of paying bills and putting food on the table. But at least I don't have to worry about her getting abused while I'm away because it's me my parents want.
I can't wait to move away. And I'm also glad I won't be going back to my parents home country. When it's brought up I'll just say ""No no, remember mom. I 'hated being there'. I 'hate my family and everything around me'. I'm 'odious'. You made it clear and you know what, you're right. I have to focus on my studies in my own country. Reguardless, I don't want to go to a place where my own family would hate me reguardless. If they knew my morals and who I love, they would hate me as much as you hate me and never want to speak to me again. So I'm good, I'd rather stay in a country with people that actually enjoy my company and people who actually want me around. Go have your vacation! :D""
So yeah, this is very long but I had to let this out somewhere since I may not have time for a therapist with my college workload sadly. Or I could look into a counselor from my campus that can do virtual sessions, idk.
Anyways thanks if you read this far. Let me know what you think and if I should do anything else besides ignoring my ""parents"".

240,yes,raisedbynarcissists,2022-07-07 01:40:25,SakuraNightGlow,I wish there was a rule to not call CPS if a child is begging you not to.,"This may sound very weird to some people but hopefully most can agree with me; So I have narcissistic and abusive parents. Specifically my mother is the abuser and my dad watched the abuse happen and did nothing to help me and in fact sides with her a couple of times and even did put his hands on me a couple of times.
But basically, CPS has been called to my house twice. Twice, nothing was done. And twice, I was horrendously abused for it and nowadays, there are still moments here and there when it happens. My mom always loves to bring those incidents up about how I ""betrayed her"" as though she didn't do what she's done to me and told my entire family and made them all hate me.
For that, I wish my therapists NEVER called CPS on my household. After those two incidents, they were the worst moments of my life and lowest.
The second time they were called, I was begging to not go home and even tried to call other family members to have me stay over at their place.
In all honesty, if a child is literally begging you not to call CPS, trust me, it's seriously better not to. Not only does CPS barely do anything in most cases, because my mother and most parents in these cases are manipulative, of course they'd get away with what they've done, but in the many cases where no child is taken out of the home, they will be in hell for a good, long while and it will make their situation far, far worse.
Literally the only time that won't happen is if there was a very blown out of proportion misunderstanding and the parents are actually kind and understanding.
This was just a random rant but I hope some people can agree with me on this, because both these instances really riled up my anxiety and made me realize the hard way that my family does not care about me in the slightest.",1,2,2,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='vt6kjc')>,,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/vt6kjc/i_wish_there_was_a_rule_to_not_call_cps_if_a/,False

My mask no longer fits, and I can’t remember how to put it on anyway. I’m exhausted. Diagnosis is out of reach. I have an ADHD diagnosis, but I can’t access an Autism assessment - too expensive and NHS waiting lists are unending, years long.

For the first time in a long while I feel hopeless and helpless.

How did nobody know? Probably for the same reason they never knew I had ADHD… my parents are almost certainly neurodivergent.

And now I’m nearly 40 and I don’t have the right tools for the job and I’m an alien who can’t find her way back to her home planet.

I (38f) was diagnosed with ADHD in 2021 at the age of 35. Since I got medicated, I have absolutely spiralled. I think that the ADHD was masking something deeper. I think I’m autistic. I’ve been looking through old photos, and remembering things - meltdown, shutdowns. 

I literally found a photo of myself on prom night doing t-Rex arms and looking like I had learned to smile from watching other people.

I remember my dad telling me not to smile in photos because I used to look like a clown when I smiled. I was terrible at friendship, still am, and I have never been able to manage well on my own. 

I’m sensitive, feel too much, have had lifelong gut issues, and struggle with task initiation, task switching, change. I’m in complete burnout.

Looking back on my life, I cannot fathom that anybody thought I was normal. And now I’m nearly 40 and exhausted and struggling, and unable to pursue a diagnosis, and scared that I’m just going to be broken for the rest of my life.

I can’t speak to anybody in my life about it because I just made ADHD my entire personality for 2 years. I can’t bring ANOTHER thing to my support circle. 

I’m so sad and tired and guilty and full of shame and regret. I didn’t even look for autism because of internalised ableism. And now I just get to live as an alien for the rest of my life.

My hands seem a little weak, and I’m dropping things, tripping over things, and generally experiencing Tasmanian devil levels of chaos.

———————

I was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 37 in August 2021. I started on 20 mg of Elvanse in November 2021, titrating up to 50 mg in early December. The medication was like magic! I suddenly became capable, even masterful, at the things I had struggled with. The Elvanse what is supplemented with Amfexa, dexamphetamine sulphate, to deal with the afternoon drop-off.

I could manage my money, remember to brush my teeth every day, keep a tidy home, and had a quiet mind. 

In April 2022, I had Covid. Following the illness, my Elvanse stopped working. I regressed to pre-medication ADHD. This led to a breakdown in September 2022, and blood tests revealed that I had a deficiency of vitamin d. I was also suffering with muscle and joint pain.

I have been taking vitamin D for nearly 2 months now, and 10 days ago. I finally sorted out my titration and increased my Elvanse dosage to 60 mg. The first day on the increased dosage was difficult, I was very rapid. I do feel like I’ve levelled out now and things are becoming easier again, however, my hands seem to be clumsier than ever. Today alone, I have managed to spill grease on the floor from my breakfast, drop a bunch of empty cat food tins on the floor, and trip over bag that I was emptying, literally seconds before.

Has anybody else experienced these types of side effects, when increasing the dosage of Elvanse or other stimulants?

I am reluctant to change to a different medication, as I’ve had so much success with Elvanse, especially when I first started taking it.

For full disclosure, I am also using melatonin as a sleep aid, and the occasional cannabis laced edible for the joint pain. I’m also on citalopram ,omeprazole, and codeine.

I know that this is a lot, and it might not be the Elvanse, that’s causing issues, but they do seem to have got worse since I increase my dose.

Heatwave seems to have confirmed it.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I've had an ADHD diagnosis for nearly a year, but almost every day my behaviour leads to me considering that I might actually be autistic. I think I'm on the edges of the DSM-5 criteria, but as an AFAB person (cis woman, pronouns she/her) nothing was every picked up in childhood.

[From The History of the World I Guess on YouTube](https://preview.redd.it/pedhk3j7ohc91.png?width=943&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7b06b936c2dbed3201894abd5658746bedd9a8c4)

I grew up with gut problems (IBS) and always struggled to regulate my emotions. Dad always told me not to smile in photos because I'd do this weird unnatural grin. Struggled to make friends in childhood and had birthday parties where nobody turned up (always put it down to having a summer birthday).

I was always exhausted from masking and I had occasional meltdowns at school when it got too much (somebody threw a can at my head and I screamed at them, someone slagged off my mum and I chased him around the classroom). I was bullied, not physically but psychologically - although now I think I just didn't understand ""the rules"".

In my late teens I remember some pretty bad tantrums when the schedule changed.

Went to uni at 18 and really really struggled. Was regularly taken advantage of and lost money to so-called ""friends"". Drank my weight in booze and ended up with more gut problems (hiatal hernia) which bother me to this day.

Couldn't bear to part with any of my belongings and so lugged 20 years of stuff from home to uni and back again for 3 years.

Aggressively bullied in adulthood because the social rules eluded me. Had some therapy and dealt with my abandonment issues and came to terms with the fact that my parents aren't perfect.

Met the woman of my dreams, married her, and she puts up with my nonsense. I'm not easy to live with.

Black and white thinking and fairness is a huge cornerstone in my life. This has caused me a lot of discomfort at work and with friendships. I'm like a dog with a bone if I think something isn't fair.

Now in my dream job as a data analyst (not a diagnosis, but come one - data analysis?!?)

Started looking into neurodivergence and resisted looking into autism because \*ableism\*. Got my ADHD diagnosis last year and it changed my life.

Fast-forward to today and the heat wave.

For context, my 73-yo MIL has COPD and lives in a very hot area. She is coping fine and isn't too bothred about the heat.

Woman at work, heavily pregnant, in discomfort, but coping and not complaining.

Me... 37, feel like my stomach is cooking me from the inside out and I've had diarrhea for 24 hours despite drinking lots of water and eating plenty. Feel weak and shaky despite staying out of the sun. Staying hydrated, but headache is constant. Brain is like soup.

Mood is awful. I'm grumpy and struggling so much to regulate my feelings. The bodily discomfort is killing me. I've been on the  verge of tears for the past 24 hours.

I'm on stimulants, anti-depressants and omeprazole, none of which appears to effective in the heat.

We are absolutely heartbroken, as you can imagine. Feral is the sweetest and most affectionate cat. 

I had worried about it when we brought her into the house in February, but the vet wasn’t worried, probably because she didn’t behave like a street cat at all. She was cuddly and cute and gentle. 

Since she had her kittens she’s been losing weight, but we just put it down to nursing, and she’s had a bad stomach every couple of weeks, which we put down to her being in heat, or at worst, IBD. But it’s FIV. We have to rehome her as soon as we can, either to a rescue centre, or to a household that where she is the only cat, or where she is with other FIV cats. 

She will have to be a house cat, or live in a house with a completely enclosed garden so that she can’t infect other cats.

I feel so lost and devastated. We love her so much, and were making plans for after recovery and rehoming of the kittens. She was going to be our cat. But now that’s not possible.

I fell in love with her the day we brought her in and she looked up at me with big thankful eyes.

I know we’ve given her a happy home these past 6 months, she’s had the best food, veterinary care and love as we nurses her back to health and through her pregnancy and we also took good care of her before then in the garden. We’ve known her for a year.

There’s a good chance that the kittens aren’t FIV positive, but we won’t know until they are 5-6 months old and can be tested. That’s still 3 or 4 months away, but the risk is low.

Feral has been poorly again the past few days and the vet has suggested that she may have Inflammatory Bowel Disease. We're also preparing for the rehoming of her babies, and I'm so worried about what the stress will do to her. We've started separating her from the kittens for mealtimes to give her a break (they are a LOT).

I'd like some advice on the future... we have 2 cats who were settled into a routine foodwise, and eat specific food. Their routine has been spoiled since we brought Feral into the house in February, and we're still not able to spay her (4 weeks depending on her tummy), so she's in the house all the time.

I've never had a cat with additional needs before, and it's hard. A lot of cleaning up and chasing Feral away from food, as well as kitten wrangling ([kittens](https://www.reddit.com/r/kittens/comments/vcnx7e/8_weeks_old_and_just_going_to_be_so_hard_to_rehome/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) are all fine and gorgeous).

We are prepared, to be in it for the long haul - we think she was abandoned by her previous owner (she's still a juvenile and was living in our back garden last summer) because of her digestive issues. We think this because she knew how to use a litter box when we took her in and she is a loving and sweet cat who's behaviour suggests she once had a home.

I just need to know whether a cat with IBD can live with other cats successfully, or whether she needs to be the only cat in the house. I hope it's the former, because honestly, Feral Fawcett is the sweetest cat, still a kitten really, and I want to give her the happy forever home she deserves.

This is so unfair.

In ancient Kahndaq, Teth Adam bestowed the almighty powers of the gods. After using these powers for vengeance, he was imprisoned, becoming Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. Nearly 5,000 years have passed, and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse has gone from man to myth to legend. Now free, his unique form of justice, born out of rage, is challenged by modern-day heroes who form the Justice Society: Hawkman, Dr. Fate, Atom Smasher, and Cyclone.

Production companies: Warner Bros. Pictures.

At San Diego Comic-Con in July, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson had other people raising eyebrows when he said that his long-awaited superhero debut in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse would be the beginning of “a new era” for the DC Extended Universe naturally followed: What did he mean? And what would that kind of reset mean for the remainder of DCEU's roster, including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, the rest of the Justice League, Suicide Squad, Shazam, and so on. As

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse neared theaters, though, Johnson clarified that statement in a recent sit-down with Yahoo Entertainment (watch above).

“I feel like this is our opportunity now to expand the DC Universe and what we have in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, which I think is really cool just as a fan, is we introduce five new superheroes to the world,” Johnson tells us. Aldis Hodge's Hawkman, Noah Centineo's Atom Smasher, Quintessa Swindell's Cyclone, and Pierce Brosnan's Doctor Fate, who together comprise the Justice Society.) “One anti-hero.” (That would be DJ's Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.)

That's why you see in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, we acknowledge everyone: Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, and Flash, we acknowledge everybody.There are also some Easter eggs in there, too. So that's what I meant by the resetting. Maybe resetting' wasn't a good term. only

one can claim to be the most powerful superhero. And Johnson, when gently pressed, says it's his indestructible, 5,000-year-old Kahndaqi warrior also known as Teth-Adam, that is the most powerful superhero in any universe, DC, Marvel, or otherwise

""By the way, it's not hyperbole because we made the movie.""And we made him this powerful.

There's nothing so wrong with “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” that it should be avoided, but nothing—besides the appealing presence of Dwayne Johnson—that makes it worth rushing out to see. spectacles that have more or less taken over studio filmmaking, but it accumulates the genre's—and the business's—bad habits into a single two-hour-plus package, and only hints at the format's occasional pleasures. “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” feels like a place-filler for a movie that's remaining to be made, but, in its bare and shrugged-off sufficiency, it does one positive thing that, if nothing else, at least accounts for its success: for all the churning action and elaborately jerry-rigged plot, there's little to distract from the movie's pedestal-like display of Johnson, its real-life superhero.",0,1,1,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13t412x')>,,/r/SpiderManFilm/comments/13t412x/reddit_watch123_movie_spiderman_the_spiderverse/,False

323,yes,spidermannew2023,2023-05-27 10:06:11,AutoModerator,Here’s Where To WATCH Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Online Free ON Reddit,"Marvel Comics! Here’s downloading or watching Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse streaming the full movie online for free on 123movies & Reddit, including where to watch the anticipated Pixar’s Movie at home. Is Lightyear 2023 available to stream? Is watching Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse 2023 on Disney Plus, HBO Max, Netflix, or Amazon Prime? Yes, we have found a faithful streaming option/service.

**Download ➤ ► 🔴🧿⭕👉**[**Watch Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse  online free**](https://movies4play.com/en/movie/569094/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse)

Over 25 years ago, a little boy named Andy received a Buzz Lightyear action figure in the 1995 Pixar film Toy Story. Now, all these years later, audiences will finally see the movie that inspired that action figure in the Toy Story spin-off movie, Lightyear, which is soaring into theatres this weekend.

&#x200B;

This is not the Buzz Lightyear you know and love—the one who is best friends with Woody and voiced by Tim Allen. This is the original Buzz Lightyear, a bonafide space ranger voiced by Chris Evans, who is stranded on a hostile planet that is 4.2 million lightyears from Earth, alongside his commander and crew. The Lightyear cast also includes the voices of Keke Palmer, Peter Sohn, James Brolin, Taika Waititi, Dale Soules, Uzo Aduba, and Isiah Whitlock Jr.

&#x200B;

Watch Now: Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Free Online

With this new Toy Story adventure coming to theatres, you may feel the urge to revisit the classics. The decider is here to help with that. Read on to find out what Toy Story movies to watch before Lightyear and how to stream the Toy Story.

Can I Stream Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse?

You can’t stream Lightyear yet — but you’ll be able to soon. As a Disney movie, you can expect Lightyear to drop on their streaming service, Disney Plus, in the coming weeks, but the exact date of when that might happen hasn’t been announced yet.

&#x200B;

Generally, with their cinematic releases, Disney and Pixar tend to follow either a 30-day release window or a 45-day release window. We don’t know which one they’re going with yet for Lightyear, but this means that given the movie’s global release date is June 17, we can expect Lightyear to be on Disney Plus sometime between July 21 and August 3, 2022.

&#x200B;

Where To Watch Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Online

With a new Lightyear coming out very soon, you may want to rewatch all the movies. Or, if you haven’t given the animated adventure films a shot, now is your chance.

&#x200B;

Just click the link below to watch the full movie in its entirety. Details on how you can watch Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse COUGHING for free throughout the year are described below. If you’re a fan of the comics, you won’t want to miss this one! The storyline follows Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Coughing as he tries to find his way home after being stranded on an alien planet. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse COUGHING is definitely a Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Coughing movie you don’t want to miss with stunning visuals and an action-packed plot! Plus, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Coughing online streaming is available on our website. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Coughing online free, which includes streaming options such as 123movies, Reddit, or TV shows from HBO Max or Netflix! Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Coughing Release in US Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Coughing hits theaters on September 23, 2023. Tickets to see the film at your local movie theater are available online here. The film is being released in a wide release so you can watch it in person.

&#x200B;

Lightyear can all be streamed using an HBO Max or Hulu subscription. If you’d prefer to rent the movies, only the first two are on Prime Video. Otherwise, all three films can be rented on YouTube, Apple TV+, or Google Play Movies & TV.

&#x200B;

The second film in the franchise, Lightyear, will be released on June 17, 2022. Right now, it’s not confirmed where the movie will be streamed after its big-screen release.

&#x200B;

Is Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse on Netflix?

Lightyear is not available to watch on Netflix. Suppose you’re interested in other movies and shows. In that case, one can access the vast library of titles within Netflix under various subscription costs depending on the plan you choose: $9.99 per month for the basic plan, $15.99 monthly for the standard plan, and $19.99 a month for the premium plan.

&#x200B;

Is Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse on Disney Plus?

No sign of Lightyear on Disney+, which is proof that the House of Mouse doesn’t have its hands on every franchise! Home to the likes of ‘Star Wars, ‘Marvel’, ‘Pixar’, National Geographic’, ESPN, STAR, and so much more, Disney+ is available at the annual membership fee of $79.99 or the monthly cost of $7.99. If you’re a fan of even one of these brands, then signing up to Disney+ is worth it, and there aren’t any ads, either.

&#x200B;

Is Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse on HBO Max?

Sorry, Lightyear is not available on HBO Max. There is a lot of content from HBO Max for $14.99 a month, such a subscription is ad-free, and it allows you to access all the titles in the library of HBO Max. The streaming platform announced an ad-supported version that costs a lot less at $9.99 per month.

&#x200B;

Is Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse on Hulu?

They’re not on Hulu, either! But prices for this streaming service currently start at $6.99 per month or $69.99 for the whole year. The ad-free version costs $12.99 per month, $64.99 per month for Hulu + Live TV, or $70.99 for the ad-free Hulu + Live TV.

&#x200B;

Is Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse 2022 on Amazon Video?

Unfortunately, Lightyear is not available to stream for free on Amazon Prime Video. However, you can choose other shows and movies to watch from there as it has a wide variety of shows and movies that you can choose from for $14.99 a month.

&#x200B;

Is Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse on Peacock?

Lightyear is not available to watch on Peacock at the time of writing. Peacock offers a subscription costing $4.99 a month or $49.99 per year for a premium account. Like its namesake, the streaming platform is free with the content out in the open. However, limited.

&#x200B;

Who Is in the Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Cast?

Captain America himself, Chris Evans, will be the voice of the film’s titular Space Ranger. Apart from Evans, Keke Palmer (Scream Queens), Dale Soules (Orange Is the New Black), and Taika Waititi (Jojo Rabbit) have also been announced as part of the cast, lending their voices to other ambitious recruits at Star Command. The voice cast includes Uzo Aduba, James Brolin, Mary McDonald-Lewis, Efren Ramirez, Peter Sohn, and Isiah Whitlock Jr. Bonus: Check out this featurette where the cast talks about what Buzz Lightyear means to them.",0,1,1,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13t3inj')>,,/r/spidermannew2023/comments/13t3inj/heres_where_to_watch_spiderman_across_the/,False

328,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-05-26 15:00:04,blushvibe,30/M autistic/ADHD partner fixates on cat fur?,"Hi there! I’m really happy I found this community, and I’m wondering if someone can shed some light on a question my partner and I have had for a while now. 

My fiancé is 30, and a late diagnosis for both autism and ADHD. When he was around college age, his parents got their first pet cats for the family. He’d had experience with animals before, of course, but these were his first “pets” and thus the first animals to really spend time with him in a way other people could observe. 

They noticed he was intently fixated on their cats’ fur and would politely point it out to him (without telling him to “stop”—they were pretty gentle with him) but he couldn’t stop for more than a little bit. The physical act is difficult to explain, but almost every time he’s around our black cat, he “inspects” her fur intently through staring, and moving small bits of her fur around to see down to her skin, or to maybe see underside of her coat? Almost like the way monkeys clean each other, but he’s not picking anything off of her? 

It doesn’t hurt our cat at all, and is totally harmless, but he does it a lot, and when he does, it’s really hard to break him out of it. He asked me to just gently nudge his hand out of the way when I see him doing it while we’re all family cuddling together, but he goes right back to it immediately. I’ve nudged him like 5-10 times in a row consistently, and it hasn’t helped. 

He doesn’t know why he does it, and it came on very very late in life, as you can see. He does stim with his own hair a lot (curling the front piece around his finger near his forehead)  and likes to rub one spot for a long period of time (when he’s holding me, he’ll move his thumb back and forth rapidly on my skin—this is sometimes painful for me) so he’s very tactile. 

We’re both at a loss for an explanation and are wondering if anyone else has experienced this in their partner, or does it themselves? Maybe someone can shed some light on this for us? 

Appreciate the read! Thanks!",16,2,2,0.61,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13sfinq')>,,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/13sfinq/30m_autisticadhd_partner_fixates_on_cat_fur/,False
329,yes,Instagram,2021-12-06 23:54:52,blushvibe,Revert to old story UI?,"Hey there! About a week or two ago, I noticed the UI for posting photos to my story, and saving the photo I took via the IG camera, had changed. Friends still seem to have the old UI, and I'm really really not a fan of this new one. (Side note: I really just use the in-app camera when I'm taking photos through the effect of my choice \[as if I were to add the photo to my story\] and immediately saving to my camera roll after.) In order for me to save a photo I've taken with the in-app story camera, I have to click on three little dots in the top left of the screen, then click ""Save"" from the dropdown that appears. (I've included a photo below!)

Does anyone know if there's any way at all to revert back to the previous UI? The one that allowed you to tap the save icon immediately without going through a second set of clicks? I apologize if this has been asked before! I've been googling like crazy and I can't seem to find an answer.

My ring finger size is a 7-7.5. The top ring in this photo (sterling silver) is a 5.75, and the gold ring below it (14k gold fill) is a 6.75. 

Could either of these rings be sized up by a jeweler to a 7 or 7.5? I was reading online and I saw a few conflicting things: rings can only be made a half size larger; rings can be made much larger, but not if they have thin bands, etc. and I'm completely lost. Any help from some artisans would be much appreciated!

However, last week, a cyberattack targeted the internet service provider I use, resulting in the compromise of data belonging to 50% of its customers, including myself. The origin and specifics of the attack remain unclear, but I received an email assuring that the unauthorized access had been contained, while urging vigilance against potential misuse of personal information.

Once I read that email, a wave of anxiety washed over me. I began sweating profusely, and the panic suppressed my appetite. It also triggered flashbacks to instances where I had engaged in unhinged rants online, whether on platforms like this or by limiting visibility on Facebook, leading me to worry about the possibility of these actions being used against me unexpectedly.

To cut a long story short, my Mom whos the scapegoat hasn't been protected as a child because my granddad is a textbook grandiose narcissit and my grandma is the enabler, drama queen, doesn't distinguish right or wrong even if she looses face etc. A couple of nights ago, she told me over video call that when she was going through my granddads messages because the life of him doesn't know the basics of a smart phone aside from a whatsapp chat group with his school friends they were exchanging close ups of women's p*bes from onlyfans. To throw into the mix, she found screenshots of close up pictures of her and I individually on a recent family ""holiday"" that were cropped.

However, when she falls ill, it takes an emotional toll on me to provide her with the necessary care and support, and I struggle to maintain my composure. It feels overwhelming, and I often need a day or two to recover from the exhaustion and stress. To cope, I sometimes pretend that her illness doesn't bother me, even though it really does.

As her health has worsened over the years, I've struggled to reciprocate the level of care she's given me, and I feel like there's no one else I can turn to for help. My family members are not supportive, and losing my mom is a painful thought. Even though she understands my limitations, I sometimes feel like my struggles are dismissed as excuses to protect her from emotional stress.

When my mom fell sick a few months ago with what could have been covid, it was the worst it had ever been for me emotionally. She was wailing through the night as she had sharp crushing chest pain and didn't want to go to the hospital. I found myself punching my pillows and bruskly placing extra pillows under her legs to alleviate the pain. She was understandably affected to all of this to the point where we even stopped talking for a week. It was especially difficult because it happened on the anniversary of her hospitalization due to a terrible job situation. I was emotionally depleted, and it was a huge relief when she finally turned the corner a few days later when a family acquaintance gave her some anti viral medicine. However, the emotional distress still hadn't tappered off and I couldn't convey my relief.

My mom has not only been my emotional support but has also helped me financially. However, because of years of therapy and her being my full-time caregiver, we have not been able to set aside money for the future. This has become a concern as her health continues to decline, and she worries about who will take care of her if something happens to her.

I find it challenging to express my emotions to others in real life and to find trustworthy individuals who can listen without judgment. Reddits my only safe haven as it's easier to bottle everything up than risk being exposed to harmful or misconstrued ideas from others.

Despite my pickiness, I always seem to end up with the wrong person.

I even got involved with a military man who had a thing for women with a certain body type and tried to replace me with someone who fit that description. Unfortunately, my father, who has Asperger's and PTSD, was emotionally abusive and absent throughout my childhood, leaving me with no positive male role models.

My father who has Asperger's and PTSD was emotionally abusive and absent my whole life. I don't have any other positive male role models as all the other men in my family are narcissistic, unreliable, patriarchal men who run themselves to the ground at the expense of their loved ones, had affairs, egostical and I could name more.

I have healed through multiple online interactions with men since I was 16 which started on tumblr at its peak in the early 2010s to dating apps. I approached these interactions with the understanding that everyone is just casting their net and not necessarily looking for a long-term commitment which allows me to adjust my expectations early on.

Despite having an ideal type, I'm willing to be flexible on certain physical attributes like height and build to a certain extent.

429,yes,CPTSD,2023-03-12 15:19:02,East_Midnight2812,Picky but always end up with the wrong one.,"I have a history of bad experiences, from dealing with a guy in high school who threatened my single mom over text from finding out I snuck out (mind you I didn't have a smart phone at the time), being involved with an alcoholic in college, to getting involved with a guy in the military who had a thing for thicc Asian women, to the point of attempting to replace me with a chic who had a similar body type, hair color and skin tone. 

My father who has Asperger's and PTSD was emotionally abusive and absent my whole life. I don't have any other positive male role models as all the other men in my family are narcissistic, unreliable, patriarchal men who run themselves to the ground at the expense of their loved ones, had affairs, egostical and I could name more.

I have healed through multiple online interactions with men since I was 16 which started on tumblr at its peak in the early 2010s to dating apps. I approached these interactions with the understanding that everyone is just casting their net and not necessarily looking for a long-term commitment which allows me to adjust my expectations early on. I'd say a good 80% of those interactions had closed some of the wounds my father had left. Despite some initial positive indications that the relationship could develop into something more meaningful, ultimately, it ended in disappointment.

To give more insight into my physical preferences, I am typically drawn to men who prioritize fitness and have a masculine build.
Despite having an ideal type, I'm willing to be flexible on certain physical attributes like height and build to a certain extent. As someone who feels like I lack masculine energy, being with a partner who exudes that energy would be healing for the emotional scars left by my father. While I am open to some flexibility in terms of height and build, as a curvaceous person who also prioritizes fitness, I wouldn't consider pursuing someone who appears too skinny or  significantly shorter than I am- I'm 5'8.5. The men in my family don't embody society's standards of physical attractiveness so I feel like there's a lot of pressure I put on myself to find someone like that.

I also admit that I have internalized feelings of being ostracized due to not fitting conventional beauty standards and being bullied for it. I'm mixed although I haven't dated within either of my ethnicities because I don't fully identify with either one. Also, my perception of everyone else from those cultures has been influenced by emotional scars from both sides of my family.

A few months ago, I met a guy while he was traveling and he seemed perfect - financially stable and independent. We had a brief but intimate relationship. The spark gradually fizzled out once he was on the road. I would only hear from him during the day and on his work breaks and he went MIA for 3 weeks. I reached out to him after not hearing from him for a while, only to find out that he had a new interest and gave me the option to remain friends or end things. I took some time to respond, and in the meantime, he unfollowed and removed me. I later received a message from an anonymous account claiming that he cheated on his girlfriend back home.

TLDR; ND (neurodiverse) and NT (neurotypical) widening gap with people my age and younger catching up, struggles with female friendships, mean girl, social bullying

I 27F identify as ND (neurodiverse). 

I'm approaching my thirties, and despite having gone through many hard-learned life lessons, the divide between me and my neurotypical peers has grown increasingly painful. It seems that those my age and younger are catching up and surpassing me, which leaves me feeling inadequate. I have always had trouble making female friends, particularly in middle and high school where girls form exclusive cliques and can be quite entitled and judgmental towards those they deem ""less desirable"" and lower on the social ladder. 

Even today and a decade later, the mere thought of them makes my blood boil, as if they had occurred just yesterday. I sometimes wish I had physically harmed those who belittled me, even if it meant being expelled, which in hindsight I could have easily moved past. I am uncertain what it is about me that causes people to treat me in such a condescending manner, but it cuts me to the core. When I attempt to retaliate, they fail to grasp the severity of their actions or shift the blame on me, to the extent of accusing me of being a bully. 

I've learned in many painful ways that women tend to approach social bullying with a more calculated, long-term strategy, as opposed to instant gratification. The dynamics of the situation are open to interpretation, and I struggle to find the words to articulate and paint a picture to people as someone on the receiving end of this behavior. I often second-guess myself and have a distorted perception of the situation, especially when my intuition tells me that I am being guilt-tripped or gaslit.

Unfortunately, these experiences have left me with emotional scars that I still carry with me today. I find myself struggling to identify and pushing away kind, trustworthy, empathetic, and reliable people out of a fear that their kindness is too good to be true. I just know there are people out there who are just this insidious and ingenious so that they can guilt trip you on those token acts of kindness that they perceive as being taken for granted. This defense mechanism has held me back from forming meaningful relationships with women. 

I believe that my relationship with my emotionally uninvolved father also played a role in my struggle to form close female relationships. As a neurodiverse woman, I tend to communicate more effectively with neurotypical men because their direct and explicit communication style is more compatible with mine. I also felt like a part of me was subconsciously finding ways to compensate for consistent and positive male presence which was why I find myself ""willing"" to put in more effort with male peers. Although of course there's those asking for a punch in the face, their games to be thrown out the window, a jail sentence and having an egg cracked on their head.

There have been a couple of vivid incidents where my inability to regulate my emotions and lack of self-awareness have caused problems in my friendships. 

For example, I turned down an invitation to a weekday ladies' night from a friend (lets call her Penny) who was possibly landing a full job at a media agency she interned at for a few months. I struggled to celebrate her accomplishments without feeling waves of resentment and discouragement, which made me feel guilty. I gave Penny some context to why I had my reservations (don't remember what I said exactly, along the lines of experiencing a lot of family issues which held be back in life). She thanked me for opening up and also explained that it was ""easier"" for the company to keep her and ease her into the role than hire someone more qualified but on LOWER pay. We didn't know each other for long at that point although she told me in her exact words that she liked me enough as a friend to want me to be part of her achievement. A part of me felt guilty for being quick to make a snap judgment based on what was expressed externally.

Another example was when an ex-friend, *Serena changed her Facebook profile picture of her law degree graduation photo. I couldn't bring myself to congratulate her because of my own struggles with internships, post-college preparation, blurred boundaries with family, and being in a new country. Our friendship started when I got involved with a guy from our rival school whom I met on Tumblr.  It was a very gradual build-up of him unvieling his true colors although I'll spare the details of that for now. I experienced conflicting emotions in my friendship with *Serena as once we pursued our respective degrees, we formed our own groups of friends and found that the people in our new circles shared more similarities with each of us individually than we ever did as a pair. While she taught me the value of genuine friendship, she started avoiding me as our goals and personalities diverged. I also know at the back of her mind that part of it was her not feeling supported as much as she was supportive of me.

As I get older, it becomes harder to justify my inability to regulate my emotions and lack of self-awareness, which can come across as uncaring and insensitive. I know that society expects women to possess maturity, empathy, emotional intelligence, and social awareness, but as someone with a different neurotype, I struggle to meet these expectations.

I don't have anything  against kids and babies in general but not their high-pitched voices and screams.

I brought a large knife from my grandparent's home and placed it on the table while (relunctantly) visiting them as an attempt to shock everyone into silence.

I resorted to silencing everyone because I felt it was the only way to regain my composure and stabilize myself.

When she falls ill, it can be challenging to provide the necessary care and support she needs. The emotional toll can be overwhelming as feels as if everything is falling apart. It can take a day or two to recover from the exhaustion and stress.

My mom is the glue holding everything together. When she's ill, I struggle to maintain my composure while looking after her . To cope, I adopted a vacant and unaffected demeanor to avoid exacerbating the situation. I had to prioritize my sanity and mental well-being, even if it meant slamming a door and taking time out to recharge.

The role reversal was unsettling, as I struggled to reciprocate the level of care I get from her. There is no one to turn to as my ""family"" had their heads in the sand, and losing my Mom is a painful thought. Despite her understanding of my limitations, I sometimes feel like my struggles are dismissed as excuses. It was especially hard when I was in middle and high school, and didn't yet understand my own psychology. I was even made to skip school to care for her, and it was a difficult situation to navigate. We don't have a third person who's equipped to handle the situation and to alleviate some of the stress. 

A few months ago, my mom fell sick and was bedridden, and it was the worst it had been for me emotionally. I found myself punching pillows, and things got so bad that we were not on speaking terms for a week. Part of it was because it was the anniversary of her being admitted to the hospital due to a nightmare situation. I was so depleted and could not express my relief when she turned the corner a few days later.

My Mom has been the individual's biggest support all my life, both financially and emotionally. However, due to years of therapy and being my full-time caregiver, I have not been able to set aside money for the long term. Her health had deteriorated for several years, and she had been diagnosed with two autoimmune conditions, which made her think about who could take over even more if something to happen to them prematurely.

I find it difficult to express my feelings in real life and identify trustworthy people who can hold the space for me to do so. I've turned to Reddit to vent and retain my anonymity.

She's been a life long learner and ASD in women isn't an exception, particularly masking and the different profile with women.

There have been a few occasions where she expresses that she's aware of coming across as a helicopter parent which some of you may know is common for parents of neurodiverse folk especially when the system isn't in our favor. She doesn't expect people to understand, much less NTs with an exception of a few. However, I'm sensitive to these perceptions that people form and I see it from their POV.

She had my passwords to my social media while I was in middle school as kids were fucking ruthless and I didn't even recognize it. Fair enough that I was under 18 but that didn't need to carry over to adulthood. Within the last few years, she has tried to be my social media manager helping with content creation, video editing and all that which she is learning since the height of the pandemic. It's really difficult to be to be on board with her because it gets to a point where she feels she can control and maneuver the direction that she wants. She's been my rock and been more involved than anyone's parents I know although being closer to 30, I feel quite ""infantiziled"" having her involved in my career etc as an adult because it feels like I'm robbed off the opportunity to stand on my own two feet. I admit I have missed and didn't recognize opportunities for growth in my previous careers which I'll spare the rant for now. I also didn't recognized being bullied by people in the workplace who honestly deserve to be abused back.

I was on tinder passport within the 2020-2021 period when it was free. I was jumping from different countries across different in geographical regions swiping on people. Even though the possibility of meeting in person was pretty slim, it still didn't stop us from like talking to each other and making a part of my routine. I had a lot of flirtatious exchanges and shared some intimate pictures with a few depending on the dynamics and being the best judge of whether they've ""earned"" that right. There were a few I had a connection with and when my mom took over my social media and I had to clear out all my DMs. I would have dug my own grave if she saw our exchanges because that's violating someone's privacy. I could have created a separate account but I couldn't be bothered to move everyone on there. 

I'm very adamant of safe guarding those exchanges with the men I've met online. She doesn't need to be involved in my dating life and know about that side of me especially if God forbids she's got access to my social media. She understandably feels strongly about hook up culture and the psychological damage it does. I sometimes post raunchy pics on my close friends stories because why tf not and hid her from my main. On the latter I would rant and post cryptic messages. I did the same on Facebook pre IG days and she'll try to decode what was going through my mind. So I decided to still have her as a follower but block her from my stories as I don't always need her to decode. Also why would I want her to see those kinds of pictures of me? I'm an adult woman and I've got the right to embrace my own sexuality.

Something that I haven't fully addressed within myself is that I have years of wounds and scars to heal from my dad who has aspergers, ptsd and emotionally abusive from a difficult childhood being out of my life. I feel like the only way to do that is by splitting my attention across multiple interactions with men online is to heal years of scars that he's left. When I met these men on tinder, I went into this with the mindset of knowing everyone's on the same boat and casting their net.

There's been a few times I've expressed my reservations about working with family and she guilt tripped me for being so myopic about this. I just feel like as far as work is concerned I would rather do things myself, bottle up whatever is bothering me, and have more on my plate. 

She then explains how the Kardashian girls for example had their mom as their momager when they first started out. They fired her because imagine all the conflicting events that four, five, six girls have.

Honestly she needs to back off because this isn't going anywhere.",4,1,1,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='10re5kk')>,,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/10re5kk/26f_with_asd_needs_advice_dealing_with_an/,False

TLDR 26F formally diagnosed with ASD when I was a toddler. Life has been pretty rough since leaving college as I had difficulty finding long-term employment and expect to do so. Is anyone here running their own business? How has your journey been as far as finding your own version of success?

I currently run an online business. I wanted to create my own business to take control of my financial future and break my family's intergenerational curse of financial trauma and instability. I knew it would be a challenging endeavor, especially since I had and expect to have difficulty finding long-term employment. Although a small part of me feels rewarded, taking this small step pushing through a lot of ambiguity and uncertainty and not having any help. Working remotely and/or in a hybrid set up is the most compatible with the structure (rather a lackthereof) of my daily routine, which allows me to conserve my social battery and function at my most optimal. Basically it's a whole paradox- there's the ""stability"" of the 9-5 along with the regular income and structure that comes with it yet falling short of skills ""traditionally"" valued in the working world such as resourcefulness, effective multitasking and prioritizing and inter-personal relationship skills. 

For context, I burnt out during what was meant to be a 6 month post college corporate internship, which was abruptly cut to 3. To this day, I still haven't received a concrete explanation as there wasn't a formal internship program in place which I believe could have benefitted me and wouldn't have completely been thrown into the deep end. It could have been because I went into this from another country in a mentally terrible place which significantly hindered my executive functioning and ability to multitask was depleting at the speed of light. 

I was also lulled into an MLM at the peak of the global pandemic- the ""agency"" was marketed as a place ""empowering"" single mothers, stay at home mothers and fresh graduates alike to ""earn"" a viable living. I eventually got a ""comission"" based project only on what was my last month at this hell hole of an ""agency"". I was told the amount but didn't stop to think how it would have been split amongst 4 team members coming home with a 3 figure pittance. I was also told that there would not be ""pay"" during the probation period. Eventually, I transferred it back to them. This male client whose social media my team members and I were managing got into legal trouble and covered on all local media outlets. To throw into the mix, this toxic narcissitc ""agency""  ""owner"" who could have been sleeping with him didn't give a rat's ass about how this could have jeopardized the agency, my coworkers and my own future employment prospects. 

So that said, I have a lot of career trauma when it comes to navigating working relationships, standing up for myself and nasty people who deserve to be abused back.",7,14,14,0.9,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='10qtsdr')>,,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/10qtsdr/any_neurodiverse_business_owners_here/,False

447,yes,confessions,2023-01-31 14:43:25,East_Midnight2812,26F almost got caught in the middle of a relationship,"So recently I found myself taking a good look at my track record. I also took a quiz and learnt that my relationship traits align the most closely to an anxious attachment style. 

The men in my family are awful- emotionally uninvolved, unreliable, narcissitic, patriarchal, chauvinistic, misogynistic, I could go on. It's a generational curse that I know I should break yet history repeats itself in all shapes and forms. I've learnt the hard way that you can't help someone who doesn't realize they need help. My Dad s*xually a***** my Mom as well.

Ironically, I tend to gravitate towards men who are essentially cut from the same cloth. I do have an ideal type with a bit of room for flexibility as far as height and physique goes. I admit I've internalized a lot of ostracizm from what wasn't ""conventionally"" desirable growing up and being bullied for that. It all started when I was talking to guys on tumblr when I was around 15/16 outside of the country I live. It was where I met the first dude I got into a situationship with that was purely on looks. I also didn't have a very stable identity growing up which was how I ended up in a lot of chaotic situations with people. 

It all starts with the typical love bombing at the start and then looking for new supply afterwards. Some took longer than others to unveil their true colors. I would typically have it worse as once we got intimate I would be attached.

I've had a few encounters who weren't ""desirable"" and felt ""safer"" to be around. They seemed to have their heads screwed on properly, mentally stable, almost the opposite of what I've experienced based on my first impression. My guard was always up and I was simultaneously on an alert for any deal breakers which happened in due course. I could never carry myself with the same enthusiasm and charisma I had with those other dudes who just weren't healthy. A couple of them asked why I was so closed off- I told them I take a while to warm up although I'm sure they suspected there was more than that. I generally know when people aren't interested and experience it myself. 

I was talking to this dude I met while he was traveling for just over a month. He was the full package and able to stand on his own two feet financially. I was just go for dudes coasting through life and been thinking more about financial stability recently. What drew me into him was that theres a decent height difference (im 5'8.5"", he's 6'1"") and there was that masculine protection that I've never experienced before which got me all fuzzy inside. Being on the bigger side and not having the luxury to assume anyone would carry you home after having too many drinks, he offered to do that and was able to pick me up. We shared an interest in boxing and fitness, and clicked right away. We were able to keep up with each other's banter that night and that continued over time. I felt like my prayers were being answered. We were intimate and affectionate towards each other even though it didn't occur to us in the moment that we may never see each other again. That spark quickly dwindled while he was on the road, especially once he returned to his home country. I was fine with us not talking everyday as it was a sign for me to focus on other aspects of my life. Although I noticed he would mostly text during the day and basically vanish at night. I haven't heard from him in a while so I thought I'd be a friend and reach out. Turns out he was supposedly busy with work and had a ""new interest"". He gave me the option to be friends or end it. I restricted him as I didn't wanna be desperate by replying the moment I got the message. I left it for a couple of days by which time he already unfollowed and removed me. I saw he followed a few girls while he was traveling- I admit it did kinda get to me. 

At first I wanted to commend him for being straightforward even though that's the least someone should do in a situation like that. I did feel conflicted as I felt like I wouldn't have known if I didn't message him. I got a message from an anonymous account the following day that he has a girlfriend back home who he cheated on. I didn't respond, although when it involves infidelity, that was when I decided to have a look at her profile myself. I also wonder if she may have subconsciously found out herself and wanted to get creative. The account sent screenshots of the exchange they had with the girl, and she said that she confronted him along with that particular post where they first learnt about their relationship. I noticed his followers and following was dropping so I suspected that this individual had gone through the trouble of messaging those women he met on the road individually.",0,1,1,0.67,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='10q0s7m')>,,/r/confessions/comments/10q0s7m/26f_almost_got_caught_in_the_middle_of_a/,False

450,yes,tinderstories,2022-11-10 00:31:35,East_Midnight2812,I'm done with short ugly guys,"It was back in 2021 and tinder passport was still a thing. I set my location to *Vegas and was swiping like crazy. Basically enjoying the lil dopamine boosts that came with being matched. I swiped on some less ""attractive"" dudes and decided to make the first move. We exchanged socials and continued. He was responsive but would give me a heads up when he wasn't gonna have his phone with him because of the nature of his job. 

We video chatted and exchanged memes  although I didn't get butterflies talking to him. Just a dude who I vibe with- nothing more nothing less. He was more smitten by me than I was with him although he didn't seem to mind. Being a relatively open minded person, I decided to go at my own pace, put my foot down when I needed to and eventually grow onto him. The first month he wanted to send me flowers since he had developed feelings for me. I turned it down as it was too soon. Part of me was even more weirded out by the timing. He didn't push and left it as it was. 

Six months later he even asked me to be his girlfriend. I shared my reservations from past infidelity issues being in another LDR that had a big enough impact on the way I saw people since we had not met in person. He kept pressing me to think about it by saying that this is normal for people to be in LDRs w/o meeting IRL right away, after filling him on almost everything about my past history with men. I stood my ground and had a seemingly civilized conversation. After that we kept talking as usual and I wasn't once inclined to pull back.

I wasn't my most positive self the night before the VERY last video chat with him before I cut him off cold turkey. The following morning, I woke up to multiple missed calls, question marks over text and 😢 emojis. I got pretty irritated by the sight of that and didn't speak to him the whole day. 

I reluctantly decided to video chat that evening after ANOTHER stream of ""no talk? 😢"" and question marks. There's a fine line between attentiveness, annoyance and clinginess and he's the worst case of the latter two combined. *Martin told me that he got an erection while talking to me right after we ended the call. He tried to cushion the delivery with multiple 😅 and 🥺 emojis which honestly made me even more repulsed. As mentioned before I wasn't on the same page and didn't have those urges. Nor do I think any shallowness got the better of me. I told him how I felt and he tried to back paddle. To sum up his response he said that he gots urges from being attracted to me and to forget about it if I felt uncomfortable. I wasn't going to let this slide and decided to pull back a little. I also considered cutting him off but sat on my decision for a bit. Two days later he copy and pasted the same message and sent it to all my socials saying ""why are you acting distant????"". 

I was on Instagram one day and a couple of profiles that *Martin was following on my suggestions. One of them was private although she was completely naked, sitting down contorting her body while propping herself up with her arms pushing her chest up. There were heart emojis on her n*pples to bypass the censorship. The other chick had 90% ass pics, eyelash extentions that were made by some poor innocent tarantula that got killed for it, and an onlyfans. She was a self-proclaimed ""dancer"" which we all know is an euphanism for a stripper. 

I immediately took screenshots and confronted him. To sum up his response he said he doesn't use Instagram and would stop it along with following people all together if that's what I ""wanted"". I wasn't gonna settle for that non-apology and kept a distance for a few hours which then extended for almost half a day. He kept incessantly texting me on every medium we had each other on and even demanded my location. I went out with a friend for drinks that same night. We shared pictures taken on the night on our socials without a care in the world until the worst happened. *Martin incessantly DMed my friend *Leanne to get through to me. I was more pissed off on her behalf since this was something to be dealt between us to and not drag anyone else into this mess. 

His responses got more demeaning that I instantly knew that this was the final straw. As half expected the blame was thrown at me with his responses ""guess you're mad"" and ""what do you want me to say? I'm sorry"". On the day I was ready to cut him off ALL my socials, the last few messages were of him pleading me to talk and not end it with multiple 🥺 and 😢 emojis. 

Honestly he's ugly af, basically the type of guy who thinks the world owes him anything once an attractive woman gives him her time and day. Half a year later, I skimmed through his following on a burner account- he's following a bunch of women whose raunchy pics makes me want to throw up. All of them aren't even following him back nor is he even a blib in their existence. 

As someone in my mid twenties, I've seen people reach their prime sooner than others and let themselves go once their misinformed decisions catch up to them. I'm never overlooking someone's appearance ever again. Lesson learned. 

I hope that if I ever see *Martin in person that I'll be affectionate with whoever I'm seeing/dating etc so that he gets emotionally shot in the heart and punched in the stomach.",6,0,0,0.43,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='yr0f6j')>,,/r/tinderstories/comments/yr0f6j/im_done_with_short_ugly_guys/,False
451,yes,tinderstories,2022-11-09 06:11:13,East_Midnight2812,A tinder date that turned into a pregnancy scare.,"I met a *US marine on tinder who was stopping by for the weekend. *Derreck just arrived the night before so it was pretty spontaneous. He told me upfront that he wanted to take me out and was the most responsive out of all the other matches I had that day. He just had selfies so I wasn't sure what to expect based off that. 

He asked if I wanted to go back to his hotel room on tinder before we met up in person. I absentmindedly agreed even though I told myself I have the right to change my mind at anytime. 

We hugged once we saw each other and I felt physically protected. Turned out he had the type of physique that I naturally gravitate towards- tall and on the bigger side. Not completely ripped but it doesn't matter. I'm within the 5'7""-5'9"" range and slim thicc so it's biological. 

After meeting up for a drink, we went back to *Dereck's hotel and had s*x. There was a bit of f***play and fondling at first although it wasn't as long as it should have been. He gave the best ass slaps and put me in all sorts of positions I've never been in before. I tensed up as he's a big guy with a big package and libido to match. Him being on top pressing against my stomach put pressure on my bladder. I also had a giant starbucks before we met so I was doing everything in my power to not let any sort of flatulence kill the mood, me being haunted by this for life and *Derreck dealing with the aftermass of a tinder date going wrong. After we were done, he asked he if his godzilla sized p*nis in his exact words scared me. I've had s*x with guys who were mostly small and/or couldn't be f*cked to make it a pleasureable experience. 

Vibes were kinda dry the following day although I messaged him first to ask how he was. We had a cordial exchange despite him being at an event. He confessed to feeling really horny after the first time and wanted a quicky. I was in town and supposed to meet another tinder match who flaked. After waiting alone like an idiot with crowds and all that for a good half hour, I jumped into a cab to his hotel after I treated myself to a couple of drinks to take my mind off it. It was better in some ways although very rushed. This time I sounded like I was being tortured for dear life. Someone even knocked and *Dereck came to the door. They claimed to have gotten the wrong room although I sensed their suspicions in the air while hiding behind the partition. He walked me down and gave each other a very cordial hug once my taxi came. Not even a quick peck on the lips. He stayed in a luxury chain hotel and now I won't be able to see this particular branch the same way 😆 

Things took a turn for the worst the morning after the last quicky. I experienced intermittent nauseousness and bloating throughout the whole day. Part of it could have been a hangover from hell as I went out for two days of social drinks over the weekend for the first time in ages- my body couldn't handle the alcohol intake it did when I was in my early 20s. I was apprehensive and panic striken as it was something I've never experienced before. I knew not to gaslight myself and vigilantly watched for any unusual signs throughout the day. I eventually decided to order some birth control pills that I could only get my hands on once I had a Dr's online appointment. To throw into the mix of this madness, *Derreck unmatched. Before all that happened, I contemplated on messaging him first and eventually decided not to. He removed his bio and only kept one photo as he understandably wouldn't have been able to match and meet anyone on deployment. We didn't exchange any socials although I don't know if that would have stopped him from cutting me off completely. A part of me thinks that there was a whole lot of *marines that weekend and unbeknownst to me he thought I could have met up with his friend. 

I have proven to be naive in the past to the extent of putting myself in danger. This has got to be the most painfully silent battles I've fought internally. I'm willing to deal with any potentially drastic hormonal fluctuations over a positive pregnancy test anyday. The night before the doctors virtual appointment I was experiencing waves of guilt, discard, dehumanization and shame. It was the first time I took ages to sleep and switch off the negativity. 

I felt like history was repeating itself as I had unprotected sex the first time with a guy I met on tumblr in high school. Since we met in the morning, I instinctively got my hands on birth control and pregnancy tests on the way to a volunteer session. I had a bit of an excuse then but not this time round. 

I feel like I should have some birth control on hand incase of the one occasion where my arousal goes through the roof. Last night I put a finger up the 🐱 as I had this weird gaping feeling down there and turned out I wasn't as tight which I feel a bit unsettled about. Even though the times I've had sex were few and far inbetween I don't think it'll ever go back to what it was before. 

There's been some talk with my Mom about having co-ownership of both of our bank accounts incase of any unforseen circumstances since we only have each other. She's tech savvy and the internet has been an extension of her since its beginnings. The website of the bank we both use has a very user friendly UI and I'm dreading the thought of her eventually finding out about this from my transactions. She's the type of person who'll ask all the questions she needs to paint the full picture, even if we get into  a heated argument.

Last week I was hungry and seen that he hadn't eaten the last of the ramen that I'd left for him and we hadn't gone to the store yet  so I decided that I'd make and eat that for my dinner, thinking I would just buy more whenever he decided he wanted that kind of ramen again, considering I found a store much closer to us thay sells that same ramen. Today after work, we came home and asks where the ramen we got from the store a while back was at and I told him I ate the last of it because it'd been nearly 2 months and he hadn't touched it and I didn't think he was going to eat it. He got upset and has decided not to eat anything. I tried offering other things we had in the kitchen or going to the store to buy the ramen or something else and he refused both options.

This week has been kind of crappy for him and he can't eat dairy at the moment because he's taking a smoking break and lactose makes him sick. We have other non dairy foods in the house.

I used to be an amazing student who would get A's and B's in school. I struggled mentally but I still made it. High school hit and my grades began to drop a bit. I wasn't entirely concerned but my parents were, moreso over my grades than why the grades fell; I think they assume I was lazy, which I won't deny, I was to a degree. Around junior year I met a guy (23M) online and we hit it off. Everything was fine up until mistakes were made and our relationship turned sour, which also had an impact on my mental health. I will dive more into that relationship with the guy more in another post that I'd like to write. My grades began to fall due to this toxic relationship and my parents were angry. I was dating an older guy online who still lived with his parents, my grades had tanked, and I did nothing other than what I was required to do (go to school and go to work). Then covid hit and everything just increasingly got worse. Some days I would eat nothing and do nothing. I would watch anime instead of work on school. I had no energy to really do anything. My parents tried multiple times and different ways to separate me from my now ex because they knew some of my struggle was because of him, but I found ways around that. Everything just got worse and worse and it really divided me and my parents. I hated that they hated my then bf and pulled myself away from them. Fast forward to January 2021, I have decided to go to therapy because I believed I was a problem to everyone. My then bf breaks up with me because he can't handle the massive depression and insecurities he's caused me. I in turn want to commit as I felt I had nothing else to live for, he and the toxic relationship we had was all that kept me going at that point. My parents slowly figure this out and try to support me, but they don't understand that therapy isn't going to fix me immediately. I couldn't handle all the regular stressors of life and I especially couldn't handle my parents constantly nitpicking my therapist and my school work when I just wanted to die. So I moved out for a month to my friend's house across the street. This really broke my mom because I didn't tell them all what happened leading up to this, as I wasn't ready and I was still extremely angry at what they said and did while I was in this relationship. I feel very bad that I left my mom feeling like this was their fault and I regret not telling them but I plan to. My friend was my shoulder to cry on during this period and really helped stand my ground while I was going through all of this. I slowly got better and was able to pull my grades up by my bootstraps just enough to graduate. Now, I'd talked to my parents about the plan after I graduated and I was told that I would have a place to stay until I could get back on my feet mentally and financially. They at least understood that I was not ok mentally, until they didn't. After I graduated in May and moved back in, they had told me that I had until July to figure out a place to live and a job to support it. I was dumbfounded, not only had they gone back on their word but I would not have the same luxury as my 3 siblings of being able to save money and learn good spending habits before going out on my own. I felt blindsided. Luckily they told me they'd give me my mom's old car for transport if I graduated and my dad ended up allowing me to move into one of his rental properties and be one of his tenants. Still, these were big steps for me to take after being extremely depressed for god knows how long.

About a year has passed and I'm doing ok mentally and I'm in a much healthier relationship with my current bf (22M) and we are living together. He's a smoker and sometimes I feel like my parents judge me for the type of people I end up falling for. We make just enough to make ends meet but neither of us will likely pursue higher education or, at least at the moment, make much more than what we are now, especially with inflation taking over. I am the least successful out of all their children and I don't know if I will ever make more than any of them.

TLDR: I got into a toxic relationship, got the big sad, grades tanked, parents offered help and then revoked it, but now I'm better in a healthier relationship with a smoker, but really only living paycheck to paycheck while my siblings are much more successful than me and I feel like my parents are disappointed in me because of all that.

P.S. Don't tell me that I'm still young and can change my life around, I've heard it too many times and with inflation, it might actually be impossible to do very much.

All I want are possibilities to why I thought this way.

As a young child (elementary age), I would have intrusive thoughts of harming animals for fun, myself out of anger, or others just because I happened to be holding something dangerous. If my parents sent me to my room for sneaking extra screen time, I'd break down in anger and frustration and idealize hanging myself from my fan or in my closet. If I was in class with a pair of scissors, I would imagine what would happen if I stabbed my classmates with them. I've never done anything serious, the worst thing was probably neglect/violent torture of a fish and hamster respectively.

It went from those thoughts to suicidal and homicidal thoughts primarily in middle school. I got mad at my parents for taking my DS?

My biggest issue right now is actually doing the work and feeling proud of it.

Growing up, kids and even adults would see me in a very unique light but would always dismiss it as “silly little quirks” or “that’s just how he is”. I was diagnosed with ADHD around 1st grade and I took Adderall until 2012. I never really considered anything more but something was/has always been…off about me and  my social understanding never matched even the other individuals that had ADHD. 

Where do I start? I find it impossible to control the volume of my voice, I don’t know (still) when to talk in turn without accidentally interrupting. If someone explains something one way and I explain the exact same thing but from my vantage no one knows what I’m talking about. Loud sudden noises (like fireworks and gunfire give me anxiety). I have to do thing in a certain order and it makes me angry if things get out of whack. I seem to talk normal in my head and writing/typing but I struggle to talk to others and I am amazed if a conversation goes remotely well despite rehearsing it in my head over and over. Eye contact makes me uncomfortable. People think I’m being mean or rude when I feel like I’m completely neutral or even friendly. I repeat myself a lot, and even edited this post because I kept repeating myself. When confronted, yelled at, or even anxious or overwhelmed I have bad verbal shutdowns, where I just panic in my head but on the outside I’m just blankly staring or looking down. There is so much more. 

I recently found a paper from kindergarten regarding transitioning into first grade and the observations about me that the teacher and nurse at the school had made that year executed by the guidance counselor, nurse, and a doctor they had come in the school each year (this was 1999 in a little backwoods country school). It examined basic physical, linguistic, and cognitive functions at that age. I was 5-6 at the time. I had a hard time speaking and I remember that part, they had me in a 1 on 1 language class with the guidance counselor. At the bottom of the paper was additional notes that read:

“Speech Language -Diagnostic
We highly recommend special classes for **** 

Observations:
 **** shows high potential for PDD-NOS & ADHD. We advise you as the parent/guardian of **** that he sees his pediatrician before the new school year. 
*There is more to the note but there is an old stain that made some if it illegible.”

From my understanding PDD-NOS was an old diagnostic criteria for Autism before it was changed to ASD. (Please correct me if I’m wrong) 

My entire life my parents never told me, nor did they pursue it with the pediatrician or any of my doctors. I struggled all the way through school and barely graduated in normal classes when I should have been in special ed…it was brushed off as ADHD because my mom always did the talking at the doctors and I was only allowed to say what she coached me to say, and now I know why…I guess she just couldn’t accept the fact her son had a learning disability. 

*side note I grew up in a wealthy but abusive household as an adopted only child. 

I’m married now and still struggle everyday with the same things I always have but it is way different as an adult.
There is so much more to my story but too way much for Reddit, I’m also physically disabled as icing on the cake so I’ve thought about starting an instagram or a YouTube channel to help spread awareness but I don’t know if it would catch on.

501,yes,Parenting,2023-05-26 03:20:05,Kmama,How much responsibility for a neurodiverse teen?,"My son, Max, is 14. He is autistic and has ADHD (inattentive type). He is a typical teenager in that he wants to fit in and be part of the crowd. He is also a typical teenager in that he is addicted to his phone. 
We gave him my old iPhone X at the start of the year so he could join in with other kids at school. We also gave him a pair of really good ($100) pair of wireless headphones. We spent more on the headphones because they have good noise cancelling, which he uses a fair bit when he is overwhelmed. He also uses the phone a lot to listen to music when he is out of his comfort zone. Otherwise it’s used for typical teen stuff - social media, watching YouTube, chatting with friends, etc. Anyway, Max is not good with his possessions. He is always losing them and dropping them, treating them roughly etc. I think the word careless summarises it best. He has had to replace or pay for repairs on a few of his items in the last three years. He saves up his birthday/Christmas money from us and his grandparents but doesn’t have a regular job. We keep offering to give him pocket money if he will do some jobs around the house, but he refuses (he says ‘I’m too lazy’.) I won’t let him get a job outside the house until he starts doing some jobs at home, as my belief is that if he has enough time and energy to earn his own money, he has enough time and energy to help at home first. Anyway, in the last month, Max has lost his headphones at school somewhere (and they have now probably been taken by a less honest student), and this week he has dropped his phone and broken it. He doesn’t have enough money to replace/ repair them. Part of me feels that he has to learn responsibility for his items, and needs to not be bailed out when he is being careless (things we have told him repeatedly, like don’t walk down the street on your phone, not looking where you are going, but he does it anyway). But part of me recognises his neurodivergence is affecting his ability to be careful with his items. I am ADHD myself, so I often lose my phone/headphones/ wallet etc. And I accept that it is part of my brain and wouldn’t hesitate to replace my own items, even if it was a stupid mistake on my part. I forgive myself for my neurodiversity. How much should I do the same for Max, and how much should I be trying to teach him responsibility? Am I creating a spoilt teen if I pay for replacements, or am I placing unfair neurotypical expectations on a kid who is struggling with executive functioning?

505,yes,JapanTravel,2022-06-21 04:51:55,Kmama,Advice on itinerary options for two families with teens/tweens,"We are two families travelling with teens/tweens (8 of us in total) in April 2023. 
We will spend the first week in Tokyo, trying to squeeze in everyone's wish lists. Then we have two weeks to try to zip around and catch the highlights. Keeping in mind we are travelling with four teens/tweens.

Kyoto and Hiroshima (including Mayajima) are a must, we will leave about 5 days for Kyoto and 4 for Hiroshima.

Then we have approx 4 days left to choose between Osaka, Mt Fuji and stopping in Nagoya to see the new Ghibli Park.

* Is Mt Fuji worth the visit? I visited India 4 times before I saw the Taj Mahal, and while I loved the experience I don't think I was wrong skipping it for more interesting destinations the first three times. I'm wondering if Mt Fuji is like this, or if it is a Must Visit destination?
* Is there a way to squeeze in Ghibli Park without two nights in Nagoya? The park is a high priority for me and my two kids, but kind of indifferent for the other family. I would love to take my two, but feel like we're dragging 8 people off the path (and not in an exciting way) for 48 hrs just for one theme park.
* People say Osaka is the laid-back cool little sister of Tokyo. Is it a Must Visit? With 7 days already planned in Tokyo at the start (plus we fly out of Tokyo as well at the end) are we just repeating ourselves with an urban experience?
* Is there anything else we are crazy for skipping? It already feels like 3 weeks is not long enough for this trip!!!

I realise that everyone will have very different opinions about what is a ‘must visit’ in Japan. Totally cool with that. The more opinions the merrier!

*Side note - my teen is autistic and very excited about the trip, but he struggles with fast transitions, so we are trying to plan an itinerary that doesn’t move between destinations too rapidly and gives us time to explore each spot.",18,14,14,0.79,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='vh54j1')>,,/r/JapanTravel/comments/vh54j1/advice_on_itinerary_options_for_two_families_with/,False

I made a post in a chronically ill group about advice for staying hydrated as someone who hates water. 

I’m AuDHD and hydration has always been a struggle for me. I didn’t know it was strongly due to things like not getting hunger and thirst cues properly, things like executive dysfunction, other symptoms of AuDHD that just make care task so damn difficult to do. 

Most of the responses were great and I have tons of suggestions to consider. But one person started off their comment with “I hate to break it to you but part of being an adult is drinking water”. It felt patronizing, I have a lot of rejection feelings towards any kind of behavior people push as “normal”. Because even tasks that are necessary, just because need to do them even for my health, it doesn’t make it easy. 

They also started pushing the whole “sugar is bad” thing. And idk about anyone else, but as someone who got shoved into diet culture really young I struggle with disordered eating. And it’s important to pull away from this idea that some foods are good and some foods are bad. So I let them know this and asked them to just be more mindful, and I assumed they didn’t mean to be patronizing but it did come off that way. 

Things just escalated and it turned into them making fun of me for asking for advice but then not liking their advice. They said I was “bitching” because I wouldn’t drink water but complained about not being hydrated. They then compared me to their mother who complains to them about their weight, to which they tell her not to eat sticks of butter, and then they added their mom is always offended by this. 

They claimed to be AuDHD as well and said it didn’t stop them from “training” themselves to drink water. 

Tbh the whole situation made me cry. I’m scared to even post here that I might be antagonized by others. As someone who struggles to build connections, I just always assumed spaces like this were easier and people were always more compassionate because they can understand. This person triggered all the things I fear about my AuDHD which is that it’s not disabling, I’m just lazy and don’t want to do the work. And that I’m not willing to take help that’s offered, and that I over complicate things or I make excuses for why some things are hard. Idk. I just wanted to try venting about this, I’m not asking for advice.

541,yes,ChronicIllness,2023-05-25 20:07:09,GhostAmethyst,Tips for staying hydrated when you don’t like water?,"I struggle with AuDHD which affects my body signals for things like hunger, thirst, and even going to the bathroom. So there’s days where I can have like a single 8oz cup of something and I won’t realize until the end of the day. 

I also don’t like plain water. I find it to completely dry out my mouth, and there’s just nothing motivating about it that makes me want to drink it. If I do enjoy it, it’s ice cold water over ice. But it has to be filtered, I have terrible tasting tap water. 

I ask because I realize that my lack of hydration is probably affecting me in a lot of physical ways. Not that I think it will rid me of symptoms, but it’s possible some things I’m experiencing are exacerbated by not being hydrated enough. Mostly that I suspect I have POTS and I know fluids are really important. I mainly drink sports drinks, but sometimes I get tired of the sweetness and limited flavors I can find, but the salty taste is often very satisfying for me. I also can’t have too many carbonated beverages due to GERD. 

I also generally struggle to stretch my budget each month (for food stamps) to cover enough drinks. The last week or two weeks of the month I find myself feeling worse because I realize I’ve drank through most of what I’ve had and I can’t afford more. 

So I’m just wondering if anyone has any tips for keeping hydrated, or making drinks stretch to last.",63,27,27,0.9,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13rruko')>,,/r/ChronicIllness/comments/13rruko/tips_for_staying_hydrated_when_you_dont_like_water/,False
542,yes,ChronicIllness,2023-05-25 11:01:00,GhostAmethyst,Bad experiences with med prescribers?,"Curious if anyone else has had terrible run ins with psychiatrists, or their med providers, or anyone in charge of med changes?

I haven’t talked about this personally in a while, I think because it still hurts as I don’t understand why a professional would do this. But for a period of time my mental health was so bad I was cycling through really awful mental breakdowns. After a certain point I agreed with my therapist to give medications a try. So she recommended someone and I saw them pretty soon and we talked about things that were an immediate concern and what meds to try right away. 

I realize now, but never said anything then because I was trying to be like a “team player”, but it bothered me that it felt like I couldn’t express any difficulties I was having to this Dr because she would just want to throw meds at it. Like, I have a lot of combatting diagnoses, at the time we were only aware of mental health symptoms. But I felt it was reasonable some of the things I was experiencing and that they didn’t need meds. Plus I was getting every freaking side effect from every medication she prescribed. 

Fast forward, I got so tired after a year of all the side effects from meds that I decided I didn’t want to do mental health meds anymore. I was in a safer personal space and I had the ability to up my therapy and I wanted to put in more energy to that. When I told the Dr this I could tell she seemed put off. Almost offended. She still needed to see me to monitor being off meds and make sure I was okay. 

During all this I was receiving Visiting Nursing services along with my fiancé, because I also had other meds from my PCP/GP and I just, for my whole life my ADHD has always won the med fight and I’ve never been able to be consistent on meds. So a VN was a great solution, especially since my partner was already receiving the services. 

Well, this VN company was horrible, and apparently when I decided to go off mental health meds they wanted to cut me off services completely even though I had other meds to take. They wanted confirmation from my prescriber that she thought it would be beneficial for me to not have my services cut. The very next appointment I had with her I explained to her why it would negatively impact me to have my services cut, and she agreed and said she would vouch for me. 

Why, when I was already stressed and feeling helpless did she go behind my back and agree with them to cut my services? I had another follow up scheduled with her and I never showed, and she never reached out to me as she had in the past to make sure I was okay with our appointment time and such. Which makes me feel like she knew what she did was shitty, because she literally never reached out to me after that and we just never spoke again. 

Since I am disabled and unable to work, I’m stuck on my couch most days. So I actually have aligned my med taking with the times my dog has to go out to go potty, and this so far has been working for me, first time in my life. My partner also left those VN services and found a new place, new nurse, who is absolutely wonderful. Anyway, I wanted to vent in a space I feel like more people would understand.

543,yes,GriefSupport,2023-05-24 21:56:44,GhostAmethyst,When looking back means facing a loved ones difficult past.,"My grandmother passed away about 4/5 years ago now. My moms family is a bit of a complicated history, with each other, with us, with my grandmother. 

My mom and I talked today about my grandmothers past, and it makes me so angry for the way so many people I know personally, including family, have treated her. 

My grandmother grew up in Mexico and never learned to read or write. She was sent to a convent instead of a school to learn to cook and clean so she could be a “good wife”. They abused her there, and took advantage of her. My grandfather that she ended up with, he physically abused her and my mom and my uncles. His family also hit my grandmother, her own family treated her poorly. When she came here and my grandfather eventually passed, she couldn’t work. Eventually when she was able to collect social security, my mom turned to a woman in my grandmothers congregation to be her power of attorney. This woman ended up stealing so much of my grandmothers money and lying to her. My uncles would often come by and ask my grandmother to sign off blank checks (because she only learned to sign her name) and they also drained all of her money. 

My grandmother lived with us most of her life but the times that she didn’t is when everyone did these things. One time she went to live with “friends” from her congregation, and they ended up abusing her and treating her like a slave. My mom was constantly asked to leave it be and leave it in Gods hands. 

Once my mom had to make a huge move and we needed to open a storage for my grandmothers things. My uncles said they would take care of it. One of my uncles who was physically supposed to be in charge of the payments, gave the monthly payments to his girlfriends son to pay it off, and he never did. He pocketed the money and my grandmothers entire life got auctioned away. 

I’m so angry. My abuelita was the sweetest, most kind hearted and forgiving person you could meet. Her sons couldn’t even bother to visit her towards the end, and she never felt any different towards them. Never. She forgave everyone in her life who ever did wrong to her, without question. She took care of me and my brother through so much of my childhood and even a portion of my adulthood. To know her life was filled with so much pain and misfortune at the hands of awful miserable people. 

I’m not religious, but I am spiritual. I can only hope the universe hands out karma where appropriate. Because I would give everything to have her here still so I could have tried to make up for all the awful things she endured.",3,5,5,0.85,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13qz2r2')>,,/r/GriefSupport/comments/13qz2r2/when_looking_back_means_facing_a_loved_ones/,False
544,yes,mexicanfood,2023-05-24 19:07:15,GhostAmethyst,Question about types of Sopes.,"My family is very Americanized and I was never taught about my culture or any kind of history or to have any understanding of how varied Mexican cuisine is. I only know what dishes my mom always made, and that’s the only Mexican food I’ve ever known (and it’s not very vast). 

One thing I’ve always been curious on, is Sopes in my house was always lightly fried tortillas, covered in a type of salsa roja, topped with cheese and onion, rolled up and eaten just like that. Are these of a different name? Because when I try to research more on the dish, I can only find the Sopes made of the thick handmade tortillas topped with meats, lettuce, crema, etc. 

The only thing I know is my family was born in Mexico City, so is this just a regional difference or has my mom not been giving me the correct name of this dish 😂 Which I would fully believe because for years they made me believe that our version of tacos was what is actually taquitos or flautas. I never knew they were not actually regular tacos until I got older.

Edit** they are indeed Enchiladas, based on several descriptions and photos provided. I have a serious talk to have with my mother 😂 because I have NO clue how we got from Enchiladas to “Sopes”. She always insisted it was a regional thing but it’s clearly not lol. I may update later if I get an interesting response from her. Thank you for helping me finally get an answer after years of confusion.

Update: So this took a bit of a sad turn. My mom suspects some confusion likely came from the fact that my grandmother didn’t read or write, and was sent to a convent to learn to clean and cook. My grandmother was abused by many many family and close people throughout her life. My moms theory is that they said things to her they knew weren’t true because they knew my grandmother didn’t know better. My mom also grew up being told the enchiladas were Sopes and never questioned it. And they moved here when they were very very young so I’m not sure she was ever exposed to other peoples cooking to know to question the validity of the names. It opened up a very rough conversation but cathartic as my grandmother has not been with us for 4 years. Interesting the many ways good connects us.

548,yes,Dachshund,2023-04-14 21:24:53,GhostAmethyst,TW: Anticipatory Grief,"I just wanted somewhere to share where maybe others can understand. 

About 5 or so years ago my fiancé and I adopted this chunky little dapple mini. She was so skittish, she had a mouthful of bad teeth, you couldn’t leash her or really touch her too much. But she loved our other little mini the moment she saw him, and the shelter knew she would be okay. 

We named her Tali (short for Tali Z’orah, a video game character we love) and just watched her grow and change so amazingly. She was one of the most affectionate dogs we’d ever met. We used to joke she’d crawl into your skin if you’d let her. And she loooovveeed food. Didn’t know how to play with toys unfortunately, but being outside, being with us, and having a full belly was enough. Even after she had lose all her teeth, she was content. 

5 years isn’t long enough. They think she has a tumor somewhere in her head. We thought, we hoped she just had a really bad sinus infection. She already had some allergy problems and was just beginning to lose her eyesight like a year ago. And at a suspected age of 13 she still had SO much energy. A pain in the butt most days if I’m honest 😅 

Two months ago she started getting more intense allergy-like symptoms. Sneezing, head shaking, trouble breathing. Just more of what we normally dealt with. And then two weeks ago she started getting nose bleeds. Massive and terrifying nose bleeds. One eye was swelling, we had to hand feed her to try to minimize sneezing. A trip to the vet and they’re fairly certain it’s a tumor, and after this week so am I. 

She sleeps most of the day now. She’s pretty much lost all eyesight and we think she can’t hear well either if at all. It’s hard getting her to finish her food, and she won’t take water. She’s confused when she is awake. She walks in circles and gets “lost” in corners of our apartment. Her eye is bulging more and the other one is starting to swell. She struggles to keep them open now. It used to be one ear that bothered her and now it’s both. 

We can’t afford to test her to know for sure. And even if we did, things have happened so rapidly that even if we could afford it I don’t think it would be fair to put her through treatment. She’s on some meds to help other symptoms. We’ve been told we really just have to wait and see. 

I’ve never done this with a pet. I’m trying really hard to keep it together. My fiancé and I have had a really rough year. I don’t want to have to do this. 

*please no suggestions on treatment, I’m just here for support*

*Edit: In case anyone comes back to this, we did end up letting her go as of Tuesday afternoon 4/18/2023. She stopped wanting to eat her food, or could only eat a very small amount at a time. This interfered with her ability to take her meds which ended up leading to her feeling more pain and also it started the nose bleeds again. Day of was a big struggle, and we were disappointed thinking we couldn't get her to have a last meal, but she actually finished half a cheeseburger and some ice cream outside the vet before her appointment.

My fiancé and I are both disabled, mainly in huge part to our mental health. But these past couple months we’ve had some positive changes happening around our life and more to come. Mainly along the lines of finally being able to make a more accommodating apartment space that could potentially help us a whole lot with daily functioning. 

I know during the Winter people tend to feel depression symptoms going up. But I don’t know if it’s just that for me. Because every time I have things going on, I think about people that aren’t around in my life anymore and it just pushes me further into depression. 

My father walked out on me as a teen and I often think where he is in life and when I have things going on, what he would think of me. My grandmother passed away 4 years ago, before I had any semblance of stability and so I often wish I could share this life I’ve been building with her. I think about friends that just aren’t around. And more recently having to distance myself from the rest of my family, and so I think a lot about how I can’t share any of my life with them. For my own sanity, trust me, it’s best not to. 

I’m also neurodivergent and I struggle immensely with building relationships and making friends. So when I have a lot of changes happening, it quickly feels isolating and lonely because I genuinely don’t have anyone I can share it with. I’m part of a small community on Instagram, and a lot of my internet friends are always happy to hear what’s going on, but it’s more of passing updates. It’s never full conversations about my life or theirs. Not anymore. All the friends I used to have that used to know everything about my life, don’t want to be in my life anymore.

I struggle heavily with my mental health, to the point of being disabled. At the time she past I wasn’t seeing a therapist but once I did start seeing them I quickly understood that emotions were not a strong point of mine. 

It took me probably a whole year of therapy before I could even identify the core feelings of my grief. 

Without typing a novel, I have a lot of anger and frustration at the way my life has played out which essentially had me not having my shit together until well after she passed. I’m not religious. A bit spiritual, still figuring things out. For my life, I truly believe everything happens for a reason. And I guess that’s what makes me so mad. 

My life played out the way it did to where I’m finally where I am now. And I don’t know if I will ever wrap my head around how utterly unfair it feels that I can’t now share this part of my life with her. 

There are so many things I had wanted to do with her and I never had the time/money/stability to do them. Some times at certain moments of the year I just become so overwhelmingly aware of everything in my life I want to share with her. Or places I want to take her, things she’s always wanted to do. Maybe this is weighing on me more because over the years I’ve become very disconnected with the rest of my family.

I don’t really have a grasp on my beliefs of the afterlife. So there’s nothing comforting for me about thinking of her watching over me, or that if I speak aloud she can hear me.

I’ve only really started to prioritize my mental health since I lost my job during initial pandemic. I’ve since realized I’m not fit for work, so I’ve truly dedicated my time to trying to understand myself and learn how to cope and learn what tools can be helpful for me. 

That being said, social issues are extremely important to me. I’m someone who holds a few marginalized labels, my fiancé even more so than me, and friends that I’ve made over the past few years also all come from marginalized communities. 

Most days I am just existing as best I can, doing what work I can in between therapy sessions. But sometimes I just wake up feeling an overwhelming amount of awareness of just how awful this country is. Racism, ableism, sexism/misogyny, transphobia, homophobia, Fatphobia etc the list literally goes on. Political issues that directly effect people I know. Myself being often affected by things that are going on. I’m lucky to be in a state that’s fairly progressive so there is no immediate danger, but it doesn’t make my heart hurt any less for those that are actively trying to flee their states for safety. 

Sometimes I wake up and it’s just too much. And I know there’s people out there who experience far more dangers than I do, and I just don’t understand how they find it in them to keep going. I feel it enough as is and it’s too much even on a good day. 

I’ve been feeling beat down lately. This is a huge part of it but it’s also just my own general mental health struggles. I find it so hard to keep going sometimes. 

Anyways. If you read this I appreciate it. I’m fine if this is more just screaming into the void.

557,yes,dandruff,2022-11-04 21:22:59,GhostAmethyst,"Shaving head for the first time, how do I go about ridding the dandruff and caring for scalp?","I will give a little context for anyone who’s curious, if not you can skip down to the next paragraph! In the last couple years my dandruff and dry scalp has worsened immensely. I do struggle with my mental health, I am disabled, a lot has happened so no idea if there’s anything stress related. But about 8 months ago I noticed my hair falling out pretty bad. I struggle bad with depression so you can imagine hygiene is really tough. But I ditched all the typical store products that were not working for me and started buying products from Lush. Made small amounts of progress finally but it looked promising. Until I got hit with medical issues causing chronic pain for about 4 months and I could barely shower once a week. It just set me back immensely. I have a lot going on in trying to get on track with my health and figuring out a diagnosis for what happened, and my hair has started falling out worse again. I can’t take it anymore. It’s making my mental health worse and my hair in general has been difficult to deal with, on top of the typical symptoms of really bad dandruff and dry scalp.

So I’ve decided to just shave my head. Most likely just the one time, and I’ll let it grow here on out. My hair is super thick and it’s hard for me to get any sort of treatments down to my scalp, it just ends up all over my hair no matter how much I try. My hope is, in the time it’s exposed I can lessen how bad it is, in a way that’s more manageable. I understand I probably won’t be able to get rid of it completely and that’s okay, I just need to not leave layers of flakes behind every time I shake my head or move it. I’m tired of how itchy it is, and how much it hurts. I’m tired of no matter how much I try to moisturize or do oil treatments or anything, it just doesn’t feel like I’m able to do enough at any one time. 

I’ve never shaved my head before though, and I have no idea what kind of scalp care is necessary. On top of trying to get rid of the thick layer of dandruff that has accumulated. I do have a scalp balm treatment I got from Lush that I plan on starting with. But is there anything else I need to know about general care, and any advice on breaking through the dandruff?

At one point over initial pandemic my depression got pretty bad. I was basically showering once a week, IF that. It was so hard to feel any motivation to for reasons on top of my depression. 

What I wasn’t expecting though is that in that time I was going to create more problems for myself later. I’ve always struggled on and off with dry scalp and dandruff. I’ve changed my shampoo and shampooing routine more times than I can count. It didn’t occur to me that not showering often enough for an extended period was going to cause extremely stubborn build up on my scalp. 

At this point it’s led to my hair falling out. And the worst part is it’s BARELY motivating me to wash it more frequently. I’ve switched to more natural products and have bought this specific scalp scrubber, and also have been doing oil treatments. I think I’d be seeing quicker progress if I could stick to being consistent with it. I even cut off all my hair to make things easier. 

It just sucks. It brings up feelings of me being a failure in some way because there’s this awful in my face physical evidence that I can’t take care of myself well enough.

I say expected but, I don’t actually know if anyone really thought we were all just going to throw away and waste perfectly good tea. I mean we were a small team so it obviously couldn’t all go so quite a bit got tossed which was heartbreaking. But we saved as much as we could. 

There was that on top of, I guess as an apology for the entire situation they gave us a 60% off online code so most of us used that to stock up on things we couldn’t get in the store on closing day. Plus our regular store discount throughout my time there was great. 

We also had a couple of instances where a ton of teas had to get discontinued overnight, and those were also expected to get tossed in the garbage.

Here’s my poem

It’s been twenty two years
Long enough to know I’m weird 
Can’t seem to figure out why I’m here
Just want to fit in, blend in, and be like all of them

But every time I open up my mouth, I always seem to choose the wrong words
It’s either un humorous, rude and awkward 
I try to put on a face, smile and seem interested 
But it comes off as everything but the opposite 

Can’t even engage, always taking things the wrong way
Can’t get the tone and facial expressions in the right context 

In between needing people and having space
But getting overwhelmed with pretending and everything in my way
Sounds, lights and people make me want to run away

I’m 22 and diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. I have a really hard time expressing my feelings. The symptoms I lost below, I haven’t been able to explain it during my past therapy sessions. I’m planning on writing these down and giving it to my psychiatrist in my next visit. I desperately feel alone and want to know if anyone experiences these issues. 
__

In the middle of a conversation I will just zone out. I get quiet and feel a lost of energy and just want to be alone and notice I start speaking very quietly basically like whispering. I don’t know why this happens

I seem to always make things about myself in conversations it’s the only way I know how to relate but my friends have noticed and they say it’s quite annoying 


I take a lot of things literal and don’t know when someone is serious or joking 

Everyone says my humor isn’t funny and quite confusing, I guess the way I see things are very different to others.

I find it so hard to do simple things. My room can never stay organized. First, it takes me ages to bring myself to clean and then a few days later it’s suddenly messy again and it’s just an ongoing cycle. The problem is I see the mess and I really want to clean up but I can’t bring myself to do it. And when I finally do it , it makes me feel so exhausted. L

I can be very decisive and impulsive. My friends have mentioned a lot how I say things without thinking and sometimes it’s blunt and quite rude. 

I also forget what I had just said like a minute before moving on to another topic. 

I have trouble recognizing people’s facial expressions and tones. Sometimes I can’t tell whether people are happy or upset with me. And people always say it’s hard to interact with me because the things I say they never know if I’m joking or serious because my facial expressions and tone are out of sync.


I go through so many phases of hyper focusing on things and it’s something I can’t stop thinking about until I wind up losing interest. And I ramble on about it and talk about it as much as I can with friends and family. It’s quite embarrassing but I can’t help myself.

When I get excited I flap my hands and jump up and down. I know it looks childish so I try not to. 

When I’m stressed I need to fidget with my fidget toys but they don’t seem to help much. The way I can explain it is that I feel like I have electricity running through me and there’s no way to let it out. I feel irritable a lot of the time because I don’t know how to explain how it feels inside my body and brain. 



Sometimes I randomly feel like I need to cry  

Big crowds overwhelm me, not because I’m scared of people it just feels like too much going on around me with noise,  lights and people. 

I like to plan things ahead of time. I don’t like when plans are changed.

I get attached to people so easily like a child and I hate it so much

It’s very hard for me to finish any assignment up until the last minute. No matter if I enjoy it or don’t the only thing that pushes me is until the last few minutes it’s due.

I go from one extreme to the other. For example I can be very excited to extremely disappointed. If I get critiqued on something I go and do the complete opposite I don’t know how to be balanced. 

I find it hard to follow instructions with more than one step involved, unless clearly laid out in written form. I require everyone to be very clear with me, otherwise I won't feel able to complete a task. I know this will only get worst once I get a job if I can even get one

Edit:
My psychiatrist read the list and asked me a few questions and then brought in my mom. Ofc my mom doesn’t understand how I feel and just said I seem fine to her. My psychiatrist just wrote me another prescription of the same dosage and medication and said to try and plan my day and do two tasks to help me get started and to train my brain.

It’s very hard for me to finish any assignment up until the last minute. No matter if I enjoy it or don’t the only thing that pushes me is until the last few minutes it’s due.

I go from one extreme to the other. For example I can be very excited to extremely disappointed. If I get critiqued on something I go and do the complete opposite I don’t know how to be balanced. 

I find it hard to follow instructions with more than one step involved, unless clearly laid out in written form. I require everyone to be very clear with me, otherwise I won't feel able to complete a task. I know this will only get worst once I get a job if I can even get one

I’m 22 and diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. I have a really hard time expressing my feelings. The symptoms I lost below, I haven’t been able to explain it during my past therapy sessions. I’m planning on writing these down and giving it to my psychiatrist in my next visit. I desperately feel alone and want to know if anyone experiences these issues. 
__

In the middle of a conversation I will just zone out. I get quiet and feel a lost of energy and just want to be alone and notice I start speaking very quietly basically like whispering. I don’t know why this happens

I seem to always make things about myself in conversations it’s the only way I know how to relate but my friends have noticed and they say it’s quite annoying 


I take a lot of things literal and don’t know when someone is serious or joking 

Everyone says my humor isn’t funny and quite confusing, I guess the way I see things are very different to others.

I find it so hard to do simple things. My room can never stay organized. First, it takes me ages to bring myself to clean and then a few days later it’s suddenly messy again and it’s just an ongoing cycle. The problem is I see the mess and I really want to clean up but I can’t bring myself to do it. And when I finally do it , it makes me feel so exhausted. L

I can be very decisive and impulsive. My friends have mentioned a lot how I say things without thinking and sometimes it’s blunt and quite rude. 

I also forget what I had just said like a minute before moving on to another topic. 

I have trouble recognizing people’s facial expressions and tones. Sometimes I can’t tell whether people are happy or upset with me. And people always say it’s hard to interact with me because the things I say they never know if I’m joking or serious because my facial expressions and tone are out of sync.


I go through so many phases of hyper focusing on things and it’s something I can’t stop thinking about until I wind up losing interest. And I ramble on about it and talk about it as much as I can with friends and family. It’s quite embarrassing but I can’t help myself.

When I get excited I flap my hands and jump up and down. I know it looks childish so I try not to. 

When I’m stressed I need to fidget with my fidget toys but they don’t seem to help much. The way I can explain it is that I feel like I have electricity running through me and there’s no way to let it out. I feel irritable a lot of the time because I don’t know how to explain how it feels inside my body and brain. 



Sometimes I randomly feel like I need to cry  

Big crowds overwhelm me, not because I’m scared of people it just feels like too much going on around me with noise,  lights and people.

First, it takes me ages to bring myself to clean and then a few days later it’s suddenly messy again and it’s just an ongoing cycle. The problem is I see the mess and I really want to clean up but I can’t bring myself to do it. And when I finally do it , it makes me feel so exhausted. L

I can be very decisive and impulsive. My friends have mentioned a lot how I say things without thinking and sometimes it’s blunt and quite rude. 

I also forget what I had just said like a minute before moving on to another topic. 

I have trouble recognizing people’s facial expressions and tones. Sometimes I can’t tell whether people are happy or upset with me. And people always say it’s hard to interact with me because the things I say they never know if I’m joking or serious because my facial expressions and tone are out of sync.


I go through so many phases of hyper focusing on things and it’s something I can’t stop thinking about until I wind up losing interest. And I ramble on about it and talk about it as much as I can with friends and family. It’s quite embarrassing but I can’t help myself.

When I get excited I flap my hands and jump up and down. I know it looks childish so I try not to. 

When I’m stressed I need to fidget with my fidget toys but they don’t seem to help much. The way I can explain it is that I feel like I have electricity running through me and there’s no way to let it out. I feel irritable a lot of the time because I don’t know how to explain how it feels inside my body and brain. 



Sometimes I randomly feel like I need to cry  

Big crowds overwhelm me, not because I’m scared of people it just feels like too much going on around me with noise,  lights and people. 

I like to plan things ahead of time. I don’t like when plans are changed.

I get attached to people so easily like a child and I hate it so much

It’s very hard for me to finish any assignment up until the last minute. No matter if I enjoy it or don’t the only thing that pushes me is until the last few minutes it’s due.

I go from one extreme to the other. For example I can be very excited to extremely disappointed. If I get critiqued on something I go and do the complete opposite I don’t know how to be balanced. 

I find it hard to follow instructions with more than one step involved, unless clearly laid out in written form. I require everyone to be very clear with me, otherwise I won't feel able to complete a task. I know this will only get worst once I get a job if I can even get one

I mostly worry about this ‘cuz I tend to grin when I get nervous and sometimes laugh randomly because I thought of something funny, so I worry that people will think I’m amused at like, a funeral, or something.

I also worried I wouldn’t seem excited/happy enough at my older sibling’s wedding, but I think I ultimately was appropriately emotional? 

I didn’t worry about this as much until after I got diagnosed because the doctor who diagnosed me described me as having a ‘flat affect’. Around the same time, I started filming myself in cosplay for TikToks and I realized I have to extremely exaggerate expressions for it to look like I’m emoting. So essentially, my face doesn’t always express the emotions I think I am expressing (explains why people always think I’m angry when I’m not smiling, I guess) (before this, I didn’t film myself much, and I have a blank expression in most of my selfies). 

So I’m just a little curious if anyone else here feels like this sometimes?",37,120,120,0.99,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13rtmtd')>,,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/13rtmtd/does_anyone_else_ever_worry_they_wont_express_the/,False
647,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-05-20 23:41:52,doomed-kelpie,I Feel Like a lot of People are Scaring Me Now that I’m Diagnosed,"So, I went most of my life not knowing I was autistic and not really understanding what autism even was until high school. However, I got ‘officially’ diagnosed about a year ago. 

And I feel like, ever since, all I see online is stuff telling me I shouldn’t have done that. Every time I interact with autistic spaces, half of what I see is people going on and on about 600 reasons why it’s bad to get an official diagnosis and how I’m going to get discriminated against and stuff like that. I also see a lot of stuff about how it won’t help to get a diagnosis anyway because there aren’t a lot of benefits to it once you’re out of school and don’t need a 504. Part of what really scares is me is stuff like people saying that having a diagnosis is going to stop me from getting gender-affirming care or from going to other countries and things like that. 

And it’s like. I did have an awareness that there can be downsides to getting a formal diagnosis before I got diagnosed, but I feel like I personally needed to. Aside from feeling like I was ‘faking’ all the time, I also feel like I do need a diagnosis for people to take it seriously. I even had a therapist who refused to listen when I told her I thought I was autistic and treated me very badly because of her belief that she just needed to treat me as though I have ‘severe anxiety’. This would include turning her camera off and ignoring me if I had trouble talking for too long and forcing me to watch a video of someone getting surgery while they were awake and making me watch the whole thing again if I moved (I was also being treated for a needle phobia). 

Along with this, I have a lot of severe phobias relating to medical care, particularly anything with needles. Me being autistic is pretty relevant to this because my reactions in a medical setting can be downright dangerous. I will scream, fight, try to escape, shut down, and/or avoid getting medical care I need altogether. Before getting diagnosed, my parents would just tell them about my needle phobia and doctors would underestimate it and think I would just have a little anxiety, so they wouldn’t be prepared and things would go badly. Now that I have a diagnosis on paper, doctors seem to understand a little better, even if I get kinda infantilized sometimes. When I needed an MRI, and also when I went to the ER, the doctors easily agreed to give me Valium. Nurses are a little nicer and will listen (for the most part) when they’re told how to keep me calm. The hospital and doctor’s office don’t argue when my parents need to stay with me. I feel like having the diagnosis in my chart really helps make things go a little smoother. 

When I was younger, I could kinda get away with avoiding the doctor more ‘cuz I was mostly healthy physically, but for the last few years, I’ve had a lot of health problems (including cancer that luckily didn’t need chemo but still sucked and had medical consequences). I can’t avoid getting medical care anymore because I now have life-long health conditions as well as some health problems that will hopefully resolve eventually. Which forces me to go into very stressful situations at the doctor all the time. I wasn’t diagnosed yet when I had cancer, and I needed it removed during the height of the pandemic, and my parents had to argue to be able to stay with me because of COVID restrictions. I was also held down when I freaked out about a finger prick because the nurse wouldn’t give me a minute to calm down. The dentist wouldn’t even let my mom come with me at all when I had to go. But I need my parents to be there both for comfort and because I tend to shut down and no longer understand what’s happening or be able to respond to questions. Without them, I just agree to whatever people say to me, no matter what it is. I’ve signed papers without understanding what I’m signing because I’ve been too scared to process them. 

It really just feels easier to have everyone on the same page and to have accommodations to keep me calm. I feel like I need a formal diagnosis to get medical care without being traumatized. 

But now all I see is people telling me how I’m stupid for getting diagnosed and stupid for putting it in my medical file because people say my rights are going to be taken away. But I feel like I didn’t really have a choice. What was I supposed to do, get held down and sedated by surprised doctors whenever I have a medical problem? Get traumatized even more until I refuse to go anymore and end up dying from something preventable? I’ve needed help and accommodations and just wasn’t getting them before, and I was not getting medical care I needed. I avoided getting a surgery I needed for five years because I was too scared. 

I’d rather be treated like a baby than be held down, and I’d rather tell the doctor I’m autistic than catch someone off guard while they’re putting needles in my body. I don’t want to lose rights like people keep saying I will, but I feel like most discrimination I’ve faced is the same as before even I knew I was autistic. I just didn’t know why people reacted to me a certain way before. And I can’t do anything about legal threats to my rights because my medical care is a more immediate need than a threat. 

So I don’t know. I’m just getting the impression that a lot of other autistic people think it’s dumb to get formally diagnosed but I feel like I didn’t have much choice anymore. And I’m just tired of constantly being scared that I’ve made some kind of huge mistake when I just want to get medical care.

EDIT: I’m reassured by the responses to this post. Sometimes I just need a little reminder that people don’t all have the same opinions as other people I happen to interact with online. I was just getting really worried about some things I’ve been hearing. 
(Also, to clarify, I do think self-diagnosis is valid, just as I think some people need a diagnosis. People have different needs, I was just starting to feel like the choices I made based on my own needs were bad because of how certain people have been talking and scaring me)",41,61,61,0.95,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13ncs57')>,,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/13ncs57/i_feel_like_a_lot_of_people_are_scaring_me_now/,False

This can make a good amount of income if you stick with it.,"Years back I had a special interest in refrigerants and refrigeration. Don't ask me why, but I can tell you anything and everything about it. I had the idea to start cataloguing every type of refrigerant, their chemical composition, pressures for superheat and subcool, among many other things. This slowly turned into other topics in the same niche.

The site was made with WordPress and cost about $10-$15.00 a month to host and operate. Very cheap investment. It took about six months to a year for it to start making money.

At its peak I made $65,000 a year in profit from the site. This was through affiliate marketing, commissions, advertising, and market reports. 

I had success with this as I stuck with it and had an obsessive interest about the topic. It involved writing 1, 2, or 5 articles every week.

This may be a good income approach for others on the spectrum. I'm working on three other sites now that are bringing in extra revenue. You could to.

I work for a company that has hundreds of thousands of products. Each one has individual sales, costs, minimum order quantities, lead times from order to arrival, weights, etc. Each one may also have multiple vendors to buy from and you have to make determination based on a set of established rules.

Planning the inventory for a larger distribution company is a skill and there are quite a few forecasting models and software out there. Some are as basic as if you have three hits in twelve months the products are automatically brought in where others have an extremely strict set of criteria that can vary wildly based on the category of product that is being reviewed.

This job is similar to Pricing but instead of reviewing price points you are viewing inventory demand, sales orders, quantities, and lead times. The goal is to have JUST enough inventory on hand to answer demand but not too much or too little.

673,yes,ASDcareers,2023-05-25 20:29:41,kerghan41,Software Business Analyst Technical & Non-Technical,"I spent some years working as a software business analyst. This was for a company that had their own homegrown ERP system. They had over a dozen full time developers on staff and could make changes as desired but these changes had to be gathered, documented, and mapped out. This is where the Business Analyst comes in.

The job was something like this:

* Director of Sales wants the system to do XYZ.
* Director of Sales contacts me and we have a brief chat.
* We then have a deeper dive meeting to understand fully what he needs. I may have a mock-up or process flow created using Visio.
* He either approves my requirements or tells me I'm completely wrong and we go back to drawing board.
* If approved I then translate the requirements as clearly as I can so that our IT Project Manger or Developer can understand them and begin work.
* If questions arise during the work, which should be rare, the developer can reach out to me. The more concise your requirements though the less questions there will be.
* When the change is completed the Developer will put it in a development environment for you to test. In some cases there may be a Software Quality Assurance team member that tests as well.
* If there are failures it is sent back to the Developer. 
* If it passes then it is deployed the following week and you can go tell the business that change XYZ is complete. 
* If the change is complex then you may need to walk them through it or create an instruction manual on how it works.

I did this job for years and I had a good time. Some of the business stakeholders can be extremely stupid and not understand that you can't change XYZ because of ABC but you have to be patient with them and explain the best you can why or why not you can't do something.

674,yes,ASDcareers,2023-05-25 20:22:54,kerghan41,Pricing Analyst & Pricing Manager Jobs,"Throughout my twenty year career I spent about four years as either a Pricing Analyst or a Pricing Manager. I thoroughly enjoyed both jobs. It was an office setting and also a remote setting during Covid years.

The jobs can vary depending on what company you look for but in most cases it involves heavy work with data manipulation. Tools used can be Excel, various BI tools, and the business' ERP system.

Most of your time is playing with numbers and datasets. Depending on the size of the company you may have other Pricing Analysts you work with or it may just be you. The Pricing Managers have to deal with other departments/people more but there is still a lot of data and logic work.

A few years back I was placed in charge to revamp the entire company's pricing structure. Starting from scratch. This involved learning the ins and outs of the Infor ERP system and what it could and could not do. Once I had the capabilities understood I could then determine what our historical pricing system had worked. The final part was improving the pricing logic but also having as little impact on existing customers as possible.

There was a lot of trial and error. Impact models ran in Excel and eventually I was able to get us within 1.50% of historical prices using new more adaptable logic with the Infor system.

During this project I barely spoke to anyone. It was all work done while listening to music and intense focusing. This is why I think it is a great career for those of us with ASD.",3,1,1,0.67,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13rs91y')>,,/r/ASDcareers/comments/13rs91y/pricing_analyst_pricing_manager_jobs/,False
675,yes,ASDcareers,2023-05-25 15:51:23,kerghan41,"My path to $200,000 a year as someone with ASD1. If you like data and numbers it may be for you.","Hello everyone. Earlier this year, on my 36th birthday, I was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder Level 1. I had slipped under the radar so to speak as I had always performed very well in school. I never bothered with college. Instead I graduated high school early to start working. 

For a few years out of high school I worked at a drug store chain doing odd jobs and eventually moved to Assistant Manager. It was NOT the job for me. Too many customer interactions and at the end of the day I'd end up burned out. It was not sustainable. During this time I was also working with inventory forecasting software and when I was twenty a family friend said they were looking for an inventory planner at a medium sized distribution company. (Keeping details vague).

I interviewed for the job... awkwardly, but I somehow still moved on to see more details and eventually got a job offer. This was back in 2007 and the pay was about $28,000. More or less about the same I was making now but with this job I could sit in front of a desk all day and play with numbers. Changing forecasts, planning bulk purchase orders, etc. 

I took the job without hesitation. Life was immediately better. There were only three to four people I had to talk to. Otherwise it was putting headphones in all day and playing with numbers. Reviewing if forecast for this location mad sense or not. If not, tweaking the planning parameters. 

I stayed at this company for ten years. Over those years I taught myself Excel beginning to advanced, VBA, SQL, and even some basic RPG programming. With each year that passed I became more advanced in my skillset and they kept promoting me. At the end of my tenure I was managing all of the pricing logic, the accounting logic, KPIs/dashboards, software requirement gathering, and so many other areas. 

The job was a lot of fun and still had quite a few challenges. The downside was the pay never really came. Over my ten years there I went from $28,000 to $54,000. I was SOOOO comfortable but a former co worker of mien finally convinced me to leave and try a different company out. It was the best decision I ever made.

I went over to a similar company but within the IT department. This time I was a Software Business Analyst. The job was basically sitting one on one with stakeholders in the business, identifying WHAT they want the system to do, documenting it, and then translating my notes over to a developer friendly requirements document. I would then work with the developer to make sure they understood the change request. This was very precise work and I only had to talk with the same five to six people again. It also helped that a lot of it was done over the phone or in one on one closed offices/conference rooms.

I was at this role for 2.5 years and my pay ended at $88,000. I had a lot of fun with this as were working on a completely custom ERP system and e-commerce system. When we would make a change it had to be thoroughly thought out and documented to ensure there were no downstream effects. There was also a lot of software testing and troubleshooting to work through. 

The friend who got me over to this company left after two years. I stayed another 6 months and then he reached out to me saying he has another Business Analyst opportunity. This time it was creating and planning an e-commerce site from scratch with a tight deadline. A fun challenge to say the least. Lots of documentation, process flows, working with developers from Sweden and India. The pay when I started $105,000. 

We launched the site right before the deadline. Before launching I had to manage a 3PL warehouse, hire technical sales people, and get everything organized, planned, and ready. It was a challenge and I didn't like the people aspects of it. The planning and documentation was the fun part.

After the launch of this business I was also tapped to redo all of the pricing logic that the company was using. During this time I got a raise. This was during Covid so I was working remote as well. Pricing is A LOT of fun if you like data and numbers.

A few years later I was contacted by another company out of the blue. They were trying to recruit me to run their e-commerce stores. I was very happy with my current employer so I played hard ball with negotiation. I gave them a stupid salary number thinking they wouldn't accept it. Well... they did.

I am now a senior director managing e-commerce, business intelligence, sales processes. I work remote full time. Very little travel. I have a team of about 5 people. A few analysts, content writers, and advertising people. We've grown sixty percent each year I've been here. 

My biggest strengths are:

* Organization
* Data manipulation and analysis

676,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-05-24 12:09:39,kerghan41,Numbers are very comforting.,"Numbers have always grounded and centered me. I'm not some mathematical genius either, very far from it. But, when stressed, or trying to calm or center myself I find that I either count in multiples of X or I count by prime numbers in my head. 

For example, randomly start counting by 7s and won't stop until I'm well into hundreds if not thousands. I do this a lot and depending on my goal I'll do easier multiples or harder multiples. For example if I'm trying to distract my mind I'll focus on prime numbers but if I'm just looking to be comforted I'll count by 3s.

This is a bit personal, but during sex some people think about baseball or other things to make it last longer. Me? I count multiples or prime numbers silently to myself.

Moss was growing everywhere. I picked this time to read LOTR for the first time and ever since then I always associate 'The Shire' with the Ozarks. 

The land I'll buy will either have a large pond/lake or a river/creek running through it on 10-30 acres. (You can get this for $100,000 or so.) After that I'll get a steel building home built, or a manufactured home, right next to the water.

My days will be spent listening to nature, watching the water, and working on my writing. I don't get to write much anymore with my current job but in the past I've written novels as well as technical blogs. Writing is so freeing. It is just you and your projects.

Thoughts?,"Some background, I am a 36 year old male. I've never seen a therapist, counselor, or anything. I'm hoping to get diagnosed or at least a professional's opinion. I don't need assistance or anything like that... but I've always felt different and would LOVE to know why.


* Eye Contact - Have always had trouble making eye contact... with anyone. Even my closest family members. I can force myself to do it with people close to me (All 6 of them), but that's it. Eye contact with a stranger is extremely difficult. 
* Posture - Have been told that I stand awkwardly. Always stand in an 'L' shape with my feet. Made a post about this the other day.
* Motor Skills - Had very poor coordination as a kid. Has gotten slightly better as an adult, but still subpar. Also have extreme trouble trying to mimic movements such as dancing or exercise routines. I was picked last every time in gym. 
* Outsider - Have always felt like an outsider my entire life. Every once and a while I would have one, maybe two, friends who were large extroverts. I would attach myself to them and be introduced to a few other people. This allowed me to have a small grouping of friends in school. Since adulthood however my list of friends has shrunk to one. 
* Bullying - Throughout school the bullying was intense. Physically attacked, spit on, punched, kicked, etc. It was because of this that I grew obsessed with body building. (Gained 70 pounds in a year and a half) 
* Speech/Hearing - I had multiple ear infections and surgeries as a child. I was in speech therapy from kindergarten to sixth grade where I decided to quit against their recommendations. (It was singling me out for bullying even more.) I am very well read but today I still don't know how to pronounce a lot of words so I just avoid them at all costs. Along with that I have the hardest time hearing ANYTHING if there is a lot of noise going on. Everything just blends together into one loud roar. I can't make out any sounds or anything that people are saying. Because of this I try to avoid those areas as much as possible. If I am at a work function with a large group of people I usually don't say anything and just sit in the back as far away from the noise as I can. I also tell people that I'm deaf in one ear as it makes them speak louder and clearer and I can then begin to hear them above the roar.
* Special Interests - My interests have changed over the years. In childhood it was video games, reading, and drawing. I would create very complex custom scenario maps in RTS games. I would build elaborate towns with Legos or Lincoln Logs. I've always been fascinated with horror and was reading King books in 5th grade. I've been obsessed with fitness and weights since I was teenager and keep up on it today. Today though I would say my special interest is my career. I've spent almost twenty years in the same industry specializing in business intelligence, sales operations, and digital landscape. I don't believe there is anyone else in the industry who has my experience/knowledge. Because of this I am paid VERY well. (Over $200k). Also, not the most relevant, but my nickname at work is 'Rain Man.' I love building complex formulas in Excel, VBA, or SQL. 
* Special Interests (2) - There was a time a few years back where I was obsessed with writing novels. It's practically all I did. I wrote 5 novels and multiple short stories in the span of 12 months.
* Special Interests (3) - I documented every possible detail I could on the various types of refrigerants used throughout the world. I went back in time, modern day, and future. I created a blog for this and exceeded over 1 million written words and 500 published articles. The site today is referenced in Wikipedia and in US Senate legislation. The site brought in a revenue of over $1 million dollars. I sold it last year due to a divorce.
* Special Interests (4) - I've been playing the same video game for almost twenty years now. (DOTA). It's mostly all that I play. I watch the same shows and movies over and over again and listen to the same songs on repeat every day.
* Divorce - My wife of 14 years left me because I had no passion, no empathy, and was cold and emotionless. This is what led me on the path of thinking that I have autism.
* Stimming - I never really noticed stereotypical stimming in my part. None of the hand flapping but I do obsessively bounce my leg/knees especially when I am in unfamiliar territory. I also pace quickly back and forth in unfamiliar places. Along with that I am constantly clearing my throat or making other 'throat' noises. No idea why I do this and don't know if this counts as stimming. 
* Scripts - To get as far as I have in my career I have developed social scripts that I used every day when engaging with co-workers. I have honed these over the 20 years in my career where they are almost automatic... but I have to remember not to say my reply too fast or else I'm looked at as strange. 
* Scripts (2) - I had ALWAYS struggled making small talk and getting to know people. I read in a book years back to use the 'FORD' acronym to get to know people. First ask about their family. While they are talking look for areas that you can identify that are similar to yours or that you can relate to. Expand conversation from there. If family doesn't work then move to Occupation. What line of work? Can you begin a conversation off of it? If not occupation then try Recreation. Same approach. Lastly, 'Dreams' is the last option. I honestly haven't had this fail on me yet.

I (20f) study nursing. I'm in my 3rd year (out of four) and we got the news today that our whole year will go from 3 to 2 classes. This meant that they mixed all the groups. Most friend groups were kept together and some were split (for example mine, we got split 2-2, when our teacher (who was involved in this) has subtly tried to split us up for 2 years now, we are good students fyi).

This made everyone fairly upset, because we will now have classes of 26 and 27 people, instead of 3 with 17/18. We got very different news 2 weeks ago (that our while class would have the senior year together after working towards it for 3 years together).

I am the class representative, and decided that next to the messy and high emotion debate there will be tomorrow, we should send an objective and respectful email stating what it has done to us.

Now this is where I messed up. Some of our current classmates currently do an internship abroad. I should have included them more in the process before sending it. 
I learned later that they stand very differently in this than us (they are more emotionally detached and more accepting of this outcome).
We had the idea that maybe 2 girls (abroad) would want to change with 2 of my friends. This way everyone would be reunited with their friends. We wrote it down and I included that as a solution in de mail, when the girls abroad hadn't agreed to that yet. I have apologised to them both multiple times and send another mail stating that the names named shouldn't have happened, because not everyone had said yes to this yet. 
The girls did say they didn't blame me, but next time to communicate to them first and that they hope this doesn't have any consequences. That made me feel alright but horrible.

Later I got more feedback that some others from abroad found it to emotional and had some comments about wording and points made. We called and everyone explained their side (them not finding this very nice towards the new potential classmates and me saying we purely wanted to express emotion in this and tell what it did to us about what and how it happened). They sounded okay with it, and I did apologise multiple times again that I should have included them more.

I am crying rn, because I should have waited longer to send it, even though a different teacher said it was nicely written and my whole class said to send it.

Everyone forgave me or said it was okay, but I'm still very disappointed in myself.

711,yes,GayChristians,2021-06-17 17:05:46,LotteTheHippo,Translation of the/my interview about sexuality and God,"  

**My sexuality led to a conflict between God and me**  

Lotte (18) discovered a year and a half ago that her sexuality is different from what she was used to in her hetero-surroundings. That’s because she discovered she’s attracted to men and women. From that moment on a conflict started with God. “I bargained and asked if I couldn’t just like men.”

“A year and a half ago I dreamed that I was married to a woman. I thought: ‘Me with a woman? That’s not possible.’ I was attracted to men so I couldn’t be a lesbian. Still the dreams kept on coming back. I asked myself if this had a meaning. Around the same time my sister showed me a series with two men who were in a relationship. This is why I started researching the LGBTQ+ community on the internet. That’s where I found the term ‘bisexual’. I never heard of it, but it was exactly how I felt. I felt understood.”

**Hetero-culture**  
“I liked knowing where I belonged, but I still pushed my feelings away. How could I be Christian and bisexual? I prayed a lot during this time and asked God to change me. I didn’t want to be like this. This is also because I was used to something different: my surroundings are dominated by hetero-culture. Also nobody talked about this topic. There is a taboo around the LGBTQ+ community.”

**Conflict**  
“My sexuality led to a conflict between God and me. I bargained with Him an asked if I couldn’t just like men. One night I admitted my sexuality to God. I told Him and hoped that He accepted me. This is just who I am. It felt like God gave me a warm, loving hug. The pressure fell off my shoulders and it was okay. I knew it was alright.”

**“People who called themselves Christians, told me I would go to hell”**

“Slowly I started accepting myself again. First on the internet, because this seemed safe and anonymous. There I sometimes told that I was bisexual AND Christian. This ended in many negative reactions. I was insulted for a long time. People who called themselves Christians, told me I would go to hell. I had to convert myself, otherwise it wouldn’t end well. This was very hard for me to read. That time has damaged my believes. If I can’t be who I am, I didn’t want to be a part of this religion”

**Warzone**  
“The LGBTQ+ community and Christians are usually opposed. It felt like a war, where I was in the middle of the battlefield. Still I always remembered the hug God gave me. This was something for me to hold on to. I believe God accepts my sexuality. He especially wants us to love our neighbours. As long as two people love each other, that’s fine I believe. Sometimes I still have – because of my bisexuality – hardships with my religion, but I still choose to believe. It gives me something to hold on to in life. I know there’s always someone who stands by me. Someone to talk to, whom I can tell everything. Also it’s nice to think that after life after death doesn’t stop, but that there’s a heaven.”

**Out of the closet**  
“At this point I feel good about my faith in combination with being bi. I’m out with most people in my direct family. Also with classmates. Everyone reacted very positive. However I do feel alone: I know almost no one in my surroundings that’s also in the LGBTQ+ community. Still it gives me strength that I know God accepts me. He loves me for who I am.”",1,26,26,0.95,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='o225hd')>,,/r/GayChristians/comments/o225hd/translation_of_themy_interview_about_sexuality/,False

Now we were gonna be done. We got the call from the doctor that the only thing left was the damage from the radiation therapy, and that she was cured. A week later doctors from a different hospital didn't trust the scans completely. Today we heard that there is still some cancerous tissue left. Next week Friday the will operate again, because this is the only option (other than doing nothing). This will mean that she'll loose a part of her ability to speak/find the words.

Later we talked about it more, and she asked me if I started liking women because of a certain boy.

This might be disturbing for some people, so I gués this is a disclaimer-is? There is a tl;dr at the end

When I was around 10/11 I had to put something away (or something, I don't remember those details, it's been 8 years). There was a classmate that followed me somehow. We were in an empty classroom, in the back where some computers were (all of this I really remember). I was in a corner and he said the only way I would get out, was if I kissed him. Idk if it was my autism or anything, but I couldn't think of the option of pushing him/screaming or anything else. So I kissed him (so I can't really blame him) and then walked away really quickly. I still think about almost daily, and especially during kissing someone else..

How my mom knows, is I've told heer last year (2020). That's because I just needed to, because I started thinking about it a LOT around that time. It was also the time my mom really wanted me and my sisters to get boyfriends, so maybe that did something? Idk... À least she said I just needed to get over it. Maybe anyone got any tips on that?

(the next year we would go for a 3 day school outing (or whatever it's called) and out of the blue the same dude just laid on top of me. I pushed him off (of the higher bunkbed) so he fell on the ground. All the other kids were like wtf? So I also can't really have anyone lay down on top of me...

First.. is there some kind of etiquette around communicating the taking of Ei sick benefits to ones employer?  do people just generally give the notice on the last day they are available to work and let their employer figure it out or do they try to communicate this is advance?

I am struggling through significant professional and personal burnout right now and dealing with serious mental and physical health challenges as a result. Professional burnout is related to previous overwork, constantly changing workloads and job description, ongoing toxic work environment, poor and borderline harassment management style, intense lack of professionalism etc.

I already have a signed medical cert from a doctor but I havent handed it to my manager yet. I am concerned that my employer might retaliate and try to terminate me while I am away. I dont truly want to stay in this job but I am afraid of losing it because I am unsure what else might be available right now due to the pandemic.. not to mention how much harder finding new work will be while burnt out.. that thought is overwhelming.

I do have a decent relationship with one manager who has been supportive through this and hope to keep them as references for the future, but I am afraid to tell them for fear that upper management would find out and try to terminate me before taking EI sick benefits.

I don't see my partner much through the week and have been researching autism and audhd a lot lately (formally dx adhd, highly suspect autistic). We just had an intense 1.5 hour conversation about autism, adhd and the two together and he has long suspected he is both as well.  It was so meaningful, rewarding and intense to finally have some time to share everything I've been learning (its become a special interest) and to hear his thoughts/experience. I forced a stopping point only to realize 5 minutes later that I had blown WAY past my limits energy wise. I sat down totally quiet and put my head in my hands for the visual relief and deep pressure. He brought me my noise cancelling headphones and eyemask. I didn't even realize - but he was right. I needed to go lie down with headphones and an eyemask on because I'm overwhelmed and everything (even light) was too loud. I feel much better since doing that, though still tired.

Is overstimulating yourself when you are audhd a common experience? This happens a lot to me and for much less meaningful things (but just as interesting/engaging). I think the fact that this conversation is about ""Big Things"" and I'm already tired made this one worse. Its triggered a shutdown. Sometimes after things like this I need quiet for the rest of the day, or need to totally reset with a long nap. Sometimes even the next day I am still wiped and am very nonverbal/limited in movement. Just find I have to really rest afterward.

Now quite far down the ""am I also autistic?"" rabbit hole (answer seems to be yes). I did not think I could be autistic until I started Vyvanse and SO much became apparent to me.

I'm exploring this in therapy right now with an autistic therapist, but I was wondering, do or have any of you ever experienced any of the following while on stimulant medication:

1. Less desire to be social
2. Less ability to jump in/contribute to conversations/know what to say but also more need to consciously script  (no adhd conversation pathways randomly popping up in head)
3. Masking being harder/more onerous (when off stimulants I am more hyperexpressive; on stimulants I have a flatter affect)
4. Stronger sensory experiences (environment is louder, richer and the things that stand out/cause discomfort are louder)
5. More sensory overwhelm and potentially more shutdowns as a result
6. Notice more issues with eye contact (more discomfort, more aversion - slight or significant)

I think my adhd is the more immediately obvious of the two (because I am high masking) and until I was medicated my autistic traits were largely invisible/glossed over by both me and others around me. I think people assumed I would be less strange if I could just slow down!

 Lately my brain is so stuck on the idea of being one or the other, not both; or in making arguments for/against autism in particular. Not sure if stimulants have made my underlying autism more obvious or if they generally have the effect of making people feel less social/emotive, etc and I am reading too much into it.",27,67,67,0.99,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13ma87l')>,,/r/AutisticWithADHD/comments/13ma87l/audhders_seeming_more_autistic_on_stimulants/,False
728,yes,AuDHDWomen,2023-05-19 22:09:28,cks2016,AuDHDers; do these experiences make sense to you?,"Hey all! I am dx ADHD, highly suspect I'm AuDHD + am off my adhd meds today (wow, brain go BRR).  I'm having some significant reflections on what I believe to be the intersection of autism or autistic traits and adhd (at least for me) and wanted to get your feedback.

I have been on stimulants consistently for about 6 weeks now and have been slowly unmasking my autistic traits/self for two months. I am finding that:

\- **On stimulants, sensory issues are MUCH more apparent.** Everything in my environment is *louder or richer,* for better or worse, and I notice/fixate more what stands out/isn't right/doesn't fit/is too much (which causes me more discomfort). I feel more present, aware and tuned into my environment (less bouncing around or shooting off in a rocket to outer space) but also more drawn to quiet calm spaces and less able to distract myself from what is bothering me. This has led to more frequent shutdowns and sensory overwhelm. Not sure if this is a sort of feedback loop (able to focus on them more so they amplify) or a sort of an unveiling of what is there underneath all the adhd noise, or both..

\- **On stimulants, I find have less desire to socialize so much and masking feels more onerous.** It is harder to jump in/start conversation/know what to say next and it all requires more effort. People are a huge special interest for me but meds make me feel like I'd rather be more passive/indirect/intellectual about it or focus on a few chosen people rather than impulsively striking up conversation a lot with strangers (which I sometimes like to do unmedicated). That's too tiring now! I feel like unmedicated adhd made this easier due to natural curiosity + impulsivity + more ability to improvise in the moment based on all the natural thoughts/possible conversation pathways popping up in my head. I did also script, but it was a much faster/loose process. Without improvising as much, I rely on scripting more and it is more logically driven as well as a more challenging process overall - I get stuck for ideas on what to say or do next. Maybe this is just because I have been relying on adhd to help me with that for so long, I'm not sure any other way? I also have a flatter affect on stimulants and don't want to smile as much.

\- **I infodump just as much and am equally as socially awkward on/off meds, it just looks a little different.** I feel like my adhd 'energeticness' (wild gesticulating, fast speech, hyperexpressiveness, hyperactivity etc) in the past has distracted people from my social oddness  or seems to help ""explain away""/disguise it? Like people assume I wouldn't be as strange if I could just slow down?

\- **My stimming style seems somewhat different** though I find this hard to articulate just yet. I have felt urges to stim more calmly and repetitively; slow rocking, deep rhythmic humming, slower rhythmic stroking/touching objects. Still unmasking and recovering stims as well so this may not be related to having my adhd managed but it seems probably connected.

**- Having ADHD in the mix has made imposter syndrome (re: autism) worse for me. T**he two together often feel paradoxical at times and my brain feels like they must therefore logically cancel each other out (black and white thinking). It also gets hung up on the idea that I must be be one or the other, not both - building arguments for/against either category. Yet I relate significantly most of all to AuDHD experiences.

**Does anyone relate?**

&#x200B;

Sometimes I wonder if adhd is in some way a neurodevelopmental response/coping style that can stems out of elevated autistic traits/autism. Hard to say as for me I don't think I am pure adhd and can compare to that.

Did adhd camouflage or help compensate for some of the challenges you experience/associate with being autistic (social, sensory)? Did it delay your discovery of your autistic self? What is your experience of being AuDHD - medicated or unmedicated?

729,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-05-16 01:35:34,cks2016,Have antidepressants ever taken the edge off your sensory issues?,"Before I thought I might be autistic, I was on/off escitalopram for 10 years (diagnosed GAD). I found it helped ease anxiety and also seemed to help ""buffer"" some of my sensory issues - they either did not impact me AS harshly or I found I was able to filter/""screen out"" sensory stimuli a little better which reduced my overwhelm.

However my chief complaint with ssri medication is a feeling of apathy and an even greater tendency to go on autopilot in my life. Without an ssri I feel sensory things (the good and the bad) are much louder and more vibrant and therefore my anxiety is also more noticeable. But then I notice I am more hypervigilant and white knuckling my way through with all the noise, motion, irritating sensations etc.

731,yes,autism,2023-05-10 22:19:59,cks2016,"Autists, do you have deep aesthetic sensory experiences of beauty?","Hey everyone. For reference, I am on my ND self discovery journey in my early 30s. Formally dx earlier this year w/ ADHD and pretty sure I am now comfortable self-diagnosing as autistic - though struggling with imposter syndrome still a little. I am high masking, hyperempathetic (empathic) and, previous to learning what autism really was, I identified very strongly with HSP (the highly sensitive person construct).

I am wondering if anyone shares experiences similar to mine. I am deeply sensitive at times and can be really in tune with the sensory ""rhythms"" of my environment. I feel like this is my default state when I am regulated, rested and free from demands (masking). By this I mean that I tend to notice when things like colour, sound, motion and touch come together in harmonious and/or repetitive ways. Sometimes when this sensory information comes together in a powerful, harmonious way, what results for me is a deeply emotional, moving sense of beauty and an unspoken connectedness to, what for me feels like, the heartbeat of the sensory world.. 

I also feel a strong *physical* reaction during these moments; usually my body drinks in a *deeeep* breath reflexively.. and I get deep chills (goosebumps) up/down my arms, legs and spine, I will start to tear up and often I feel a huge urge to stim - to rock or sway back and forth in harmony with that rhythm. Sometimes it happens when a voice will match and resonate with the rising sound of an instrument. Today I had a moment when I was listening to music; a crow flew in tandem alongside my bus for three blocks, riding on the wind directly across from me, looping and diving somehow perfectly with the swelling and falling of the music I was listening to. The song was one that started soft but built in tender intensity and I had just been reflecting on the cumulative grief I feel from having masked increasingly throughout my life; how cut off it has made me feel from my own nature and the world around me, how harmful it was that the knowledge of my way of being was denied to me because I was different and because I was too busy being so harshly, actively molded to inhabit some other self. A neurotypical one. What endured for me was a feeling of somehow some part of me persevering through all this.. all the difficult experiences. I felt like the crow/natural world was acknowledging this somehow (personification?).

For reference, I also see images/shapes or figures in clouds, bathroom tiles and other ambiguous sensory material often, though this often not a moving emotional experience. I also sometimes struggle to notice and name my feelings because I often feel overwhelmed by sensory or masking demands and often have coped by numbing/disassociating from my real feelings. I am also just as easily agitated by disharmonies in my environment (too much or heavily contrasting sound/colour/motion etc), repetitions becoming interrupted (patterns ending, things in motion stopping) and by things that 'stick out' or overpower others, whether that be loud out of the blue sounds or intense colours or say too much traffic. In some ways I am sensory seeking, other ways sensory avoiding.. I often need sensory things to be in the 'goldilocks zone', whatever that might be at that moment.

There is a lot of debate around the construct of HSP, whether it is code for autism without the stigma attached or whether it can occur in addition to autism. I probably fall in the first category but it makes me wonder about the experiences of other autists. I am not sure if these experiences are tied to my being high in openness to experience/spiritual by nature, HSP, the sensory/repetition aspects of autism, ADHD ""Big Feelings"", ND alexithymia (we are cut off from our feelings and suddenly, in moments like these, realize what we are feeling because it is sometimes being mirrored back to in a way we have not yet recognized?) or all of the above..

I feel like within order, structure, pattern recognition and repetition (things we naturally gravitate to as autists) there lies a lot of inherent *harmony,* which often itself underlies experiences of beauty. i.e. as in symmetry, the golden ratio, etc. Because of this, I feel like many autists might share these similar experiences.

It makes me think of a video I came across early on in my discovery journey by nonspeaker Mel Baggs' called ""In My Language""; she talks about how autism to her is about being in a constant conversation with her environment.. that resonated with me deeply, though my experience in the world is very different to Mels. And though there may or may not be controvery around Mel (I have read mixed things).

ANYWAY! Does anyone relate to this or have similar experiences? Do you have your own understanding about what gives rise to these kinds of experiences for you?

In our audhd house we love Bluey. Was also thinking about how much I LOVED magic school bus as a kid.. and realized how perfect the format of the show is for the audhd brain: they do the same basic thing every episode - hang out in class, wonder out loud about some natural phenomenon, then take a fanrastical, mega immersive feld trip to explore it. Theres a formula and structure punctuated by an exciting adventure!

I realize film and tv programming is like this generally as a whole in the sense that we tend to have a predictable structure from film/tv conventions with interesting conflict, setting, special effects etc mixed in for that dopamine-boosting awe and wonder.. but man some childrens shows just really scratch that audhd itch. perfect blended order and chaos in a neat and short (not too long) package!

I think I also liked Big Comfy Couch (shoutout to canada) for similar reasons.. the mc is a very sort of adhd/audhd character.. makes a big mess (literally/metaphorically) and then by the end of the episode quickly and painlessly tidies it all up. The mess/chaos and the tidyness/order (as well as relatable character) just tickle my brain.

734,yes,ADHD,2023-03-30 02:48:05,cks2016,ADHD Diagnosis/Treatment Unveiling Autism or Autistic Traits?,"Hi everyone,

Forgive me if this is a little meandering. I am struggling to process everything.

I am in my early 30s and for the last few months I have been going through the process of learning about/understanding my adhd and received a formal diagnosis. I've been seeing a counsellor that specializes in adhd prior to this on a weekly basis  to openly question and make sense of my life experiences, process my knew understanding of adhd and how it has impacted me, and to process some of the new unknowns or OTHER questions this also brings up..

The most recent turn in this journey has me questioning whether or not I may be on the spectrum in some way..  When I was screened for spectrum traits during my adhd assessment, the screen was positive (suggesting further investigation needed). At the time I brushed it off but now, especially after starting stimulant medication, I am seeing what changes and what doesn't change with the support of medication.. and I find myself considering my underlying autistic traits.. 

I know there is often a lot of overlap/comorbidity between ASD and ADHD and this is not uncommon, but it took me so long to see/validate/understand ADHD.. and in my ignorance (having associated asd with the stereotypical 'male' phenotype) I really did not (and still in many ways do not) understand just *how much* *autistic experience varies* from person to person, and how it presents differently particularly women and in individuals with other 'conditions'. I'm wondering, did any of you experience this similar new picture coming into focus about autism or your autistic traits after receiving your adhd diagnosis or treatment? If you went through a period of questioning, what helped you to understand your experience? Were there certain resources or tools you used to help you better understand yourself? Did you end up getting assessed?

I realize my autistic traits look different as a woman (vs man) and also as a woman with adhd.. it is very hard to understand. I feel like if I am autistic, or have autistic traits.. they lean more borderline/mild maybe and my adhd may be the larger influence. But I am not sure, because I was blind to my adhd for so long - I think in a lot of ways I am still ignorant to my own autistic traits. I am trying to find more information about.. (please forgive me, these are the labels I've found) mild/high functioning/level 1/borderline/subclinical autism and the 'broader autistic phenotype'.. It is so hard to find info about the first-hand experiences of individuals who fall in this category.

If anyone could take some time to share a bit about their journey, particularly if your autism was more camouflaged to you, I'd be so so grateful.

736,yes,ADHD,2022-11-24 20:29:19,cks2016,Craving stimuli even when overloaded?,"Hi everyone, I am 31f and in the process of receiving a diagnosis for ADHD. All my life I have struggled with executive dysfunction and this has led to episodes of depression and a lot of internalized shame/chronic anxiety. My family shows strong ADHD symptomology as well - restlessness, driven by a motor, language/testing difficulties, disorganization, emotional dysregulation, impulsive behaviour, forgetfulness, etc.

I realize I had done so much work to he aware of and nonmedically moderate the worst of my ADHD symptoms but so much of that went out the window during the pandemic. So much upheaval has happened in my life. My symptomology is particularly bad right now - I think exacerbated by chronic stress and lack of structure in my current work/personal situation and the fact that I was put on an SSRI for depression a few months ago.

I am noticing that my brain is JUMPING around like mad from one track to the next, always with a question or thought and such a strong urge to investigate more fully. I have issues with sensory overload but am finding where I could normally use tools I developed to limit my stimulation seeking, now I cannot - even when overloaded. I will feel fatigued, my brain tired, craving a reprieve from stimuli and like a migraine is about to come on if I don't but I still can't stop myself from getting up to do things or bouncing around on my phone, opening up new tabs, googling new things. I don't even fully TAKE IN what I'm reading/watching or otherwise 'investigating' before jumping down the next rabbit hole with the first adjacent thought that pops up.

Is this part of ADHD? Do any of you struggle with stimulation seeking even past your own physical limits? I know even in terms of physical restlessness I alsp struggle to stop. I keep moving and doing things even despite chronic pain in my hips from a musculoskeletal injury because I think of things that must be done or that I want to go get/check out, etc and its impacted by health so much.

I also find it hard to find a time/place to remove myself from stimulation.. work is chaos, personal life is in limbo, my home is so disorganized and we have construction going on daily next door. I used to self moderate by quiet time in a room or walks in nature. Hard to do lately.

I'm looking for a compassionate professional with a strong understanding of ADHD/ASD to speak to about some aspects of my relationship with my longtime partner.

My partner and I both live with ADHD and he is also on the spectrum. Our relationship is sometimes very challenging - as longterm partnerships often are. He is a wonderful person and I love him dearly. Because of this, I'm working hard to better understand his nuances and support him, and support myself while we navigate challenges together. I have learned so much through our four years of partnership and know he has as well. I've seen him grow in incredible ways that have challenged (and positively changed) my understanding of autism. However there is more still that I need help processing and I would like to do that work; for me, for him and for us. It has been difficult sometimes to create a pause and a place for gaining perspective, especially through all the external change and challenges of the pandemic and the added stress that has placed on us.

I'm looking to find a professional with a kind demeanour and strong, nuanced understanding of folks on the spectrum/living with ADHD.. perhaps either first or secondhand experience.. i.e. who themselves live with ASD/ADHD or who maybe have a dear friend or family member with ASD.. or who specializes in working with individuals/families living with ADHD/ASD. I have self educated a great deal many different accessible resources and have seen a professional for personal support however they lacked a level of knowledge/experience in this area and found it difficult to speak to our experiences. I was grateful still for the awareness of the impact these challenges have had on me and for their support in growing my ability to engage in effective self care, yet I still find myself needing to explore my partnership's realities and complexities more in depth with someone who has a greater deal of familiarity. I'd like to gain more clarity and objectivity on our life as it is together.

Does anyone have any recommendations for a counsellor in the vancouver area who has been a tremendous help to them in this regard? I have unfortunately found it difficult to find any accepting new clients and I am finding it hard to continue searching.

746,yes,AutismInWomen,2023-04-14 17:10:22,AdorableAcres,Burn Out - So Many Questions,"2 years ago I experienced what I am now coming to realize was possibly autistic burnout mixed with a whole lot of cptsd. I have labeled it as a mental breakdown. My therapists and psychiatrists saw it as complete and utter overwhelm from trauma.   The treatment has been blessed venlafaxine, nightmare medication, (and after learning about adhd) adderall plus SO MUCH trauma therapy. It began as 2 hour sessions twice a week for about 8 months, moved to weekly sessions then bi-weekly sessions. Clearly it helped. But....I will never be done with unpacking the trauma, it seems. At this rate I could be unpacking trauma once a week for all eternity. I am ready to not just exist, but to live life again.

 Except I can't. 

 It's not agoraphobia - I'm not afraid  if I leave my house. I just don't want to. It  inevitably ends with some sort of triggered response to some stimuli. The idea of ""exposure therapy"" does more harm than good.  

It's not depression - I can get out of bed and engage (trust me, I know what depression is)

It's not panic attacks - it's overwhelm. 

So...my question is this:

**What happens after burn out?** Any research I attempt to do on burn out is frustratingly vague and the ""years to recover from"" platitude doesn't entail WTF one would experience during these years. Currently what I'm experiencing feels like an existential crisis. My past identity is gone and I'm fine (glad, even) with that - but what am I supposed to expect, to focus on, to work on, to imagine?  NT therapy's focus is to get through the trauma. To get back to what you were doing. I realize that's not a reality for me. I'm not going to revamp my resume and rejoin the workforce. I'm not going to be a PTA mom volunteering at my kids school. I'm not going to be June Cleaver with a perfect household (thank god, that was EXHAUSTING and not worth it). 

 Yet anything I can find on autistic burnout simply states it sucks, takes years to recover from, and...........?

I have an obscure google website with 25+ themes together like this and character details, etc,  but mainly use it as a way to organize all of the information. As the collection has grown,  I feel like these could benefit from being shared. So here's the first one I'm sharing. If you have a theme you'd like, feel free to reach out. 

Note: I do not speak Japanese. I use translation apps and my best judgement, so I am not claiming any of these to be correctly translated. Please (please please) don't roast me for being wildly wrong about the translation. Feel free to add the correct translation in a comment.

Yesterday I had barely slept and was the warmest day of the year so far, I chose the wrong clothes (too high neck and the cotton top was a bit too thick). The bus was too warm. Here I was already on thin ice. 

Got to uni and this alarm kept going off. We tried to have a seminar outside but it was loud, so we went inside again. I didn’t feel comfortable stimming too much and my nerves were fraught…

Bought lunch and the machine messed up my order… twice. But eventually I got it right. Picked a book up at the library and then went to look for a book for my dad because his birthday is next week. There I got the call I was dreading, but knew was coming, that I didn’t get a job I really wanted (they wanted me but someone else had more experience)…

The straw that broke the camel’s back was that I hadn’t gotten my summer schedule for my job despite them telling me I should’ve gotten it last week. Not getting this job made me severely anxious about not getting the schedule. You know how it is… they said something and it wasn’t happening, and and the uncertainty just had me in bits. 

I was crying so much and I couldn’t stop. Everything felt out of control and I was panicking. There had been too much noise and there were too many people. But because I knew what was behind it, that I was having a meltdown, I put on my sunglasses and put videos on with subjects that calm me, and I immediately went home. 

I couldn’t communicate, but I could get home and rest. By the time I came home I had my schedule… but it upsets me so much when someone says that I should get something within a specific week and it doesn’t happen that week. I’d rather get a vague timeline than that (I think) 

Knowing what it was helped so much to be able to tackle it. It took ~30min and it was under control but that’s really good for me",2,25,25,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13roven')>,,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/13roven/had_a_meltdown_in_public_for_the_first_time_in_a/,False

My family would travel every summer to England to visit my grandmother and dad's family who still lived there, for a while we would stay a week with my grandmother and would spend a week doing a roadtrip and spending time somewhere else in the UK. That summer we traveled up to Scotland and stayed somewhere in the northernmost Scotland (Inverness perhaps?), I was only 7 or 8 so I can't remember where exactly. 

As we traveled around we went somewhere touristy and I got a tartan patterned journal that I immediately wrote down my name and address in, just in case and because I wanted to practice. I also decided to write in in English, because we were in the UK, duh. This turned out to be a very good thing for the rest of the story... however, I did a pretty poor job of it...

We visited a lovely shop where we purchased a couple of thing, and left a couple of things behind. One thing was my journal, another thing was my older sister's pair of shoes (that she had been wearing!), and some other things we had bought there. Good thing to note: we were undiagnosed ADHD back then, so forgetting things everywhere was a bit of me and my sister's memo. We were, of course, sad these things were lost, but couldn't go back and get them for various reasons. We wrote it off as lost, like many things were when we were younger...

So we went back to Sweden, forgot about all of this... and then around October we got a big package delivered to us. We had no idea what it was about, except that the address was close to illegible, and it was from Scotland. When we opened it we found everything we had accidentally left behind!

The lovely store owners in Scotland had decided to send a pretty expensive package to Sweden, only my poorly written attempt at English and our home address had the package bouncing arount Switzerland (!!!) for months, before ending up in Sweden for a while until it finally ended up in the right hands (the stamps etc. were fun to read). So we got the things we bought, and forgot, and the things we lost (and forgot) back to us. 

It still makes me smile thinking about because they didn't have to send the stuff, and the post-offices that didn't give up and write the address off as a loss, and that they actually figured out where it was meant to go! So many people had to have taken the time to get it to us. Love it!

781,yes,MarkNarrations,2021-07-30 15:47:31,amrjs,Rented out my apartment to someone who didn't flush the toilet... ever?,"So this happened a few years ago, back in 2018, but I still get frustrated thinking about it.

I lived in a student apartment but had just then finished my last course and was unemployed. Because the apartment was really expensive I decided to rent it out during the end of the lease period. I had rented it out previous years when I'd gone home to my parents to work for the summer, and it had worked out pretty well. It wasn't something I really liked doing, but I didn't have much of a choice.

After a while I decided to rent the apartment to a girl who was around 19, and about that time I got a job. 

All was, seemingly, going well... until I had to head over there for an evening to let an inspector into the apartment (pre-move out inspection). The apartment was messy, but I'm not the most tidy person so I didn't mind that. But, she had gone away for a few days and left poop sitting in the toilet. She hadn't flushed. So I had to clean up her poop before the inspector got there. Ew number one.

I texted her that it's important to flush the toilet, especially if you're going away. 

Anyway, my landlord contacted me and said that someone was interested in moving into the apartment at an earlier date, April 1st if I recall correctly, rather than the May 2nd that was previously decided on. I had told the girl this previously, and we had a contract that stated that I could give 1 month's notice if I had to have her leave the apartment earlier. She wasn't happy, but I understood because the housing market is terrible, and I was one of the few people who was renting at a fair price (I only asked for a little extra as apartment was fully furnished with my things).

This is when I try to arrange a meeting with her to have a key hand-over. I realize something sketchy is up, because I say that we can meet on the Friday, but she explains she can't. Okay, I worked late on thursday... so wednesday? We go back and forth, she tells me she's got the whole monday off and that works best for her, and again, I'm working late that day so I couldn't, but told her she could drop the keys off in the mailbox and we'll figure it out from there. I'm bracing myself for the worst.....

And, sure enough. She probably hadn't flushed her poop in weeks, somehow sugar had gotten stuck to the counters in the kicthens, the cabinets were sticky and oily, there was a layer of dust so thick that she couldn't have vaccuumed even once. I'd left cleaning supplies, including a vaccuum, for her to use. Nope. Again, giving her the benefit of the doubt, I shoot her a text feigning confusion saying ""are you coming back to clean?"" Of course, she was not. I didn't expect it to be super clean, but with the poop, the sugar, the residue on cabinets (and in the bathroom??) it was all too much. I told her I would be keeping the security deposit because I would have to spend a lot more time cleaning (I had to enlist my family to get it done in time) and couldn't take time off work to move bc I was so new at the job. 

She got so upset with me, saying she'd saved that money for xyz. Well... should've hired someone to clean then, not tried to avoid me so much that you didn't take that monday you had off to clean, etc. I just cannot imagine leaving your poop behind and think that that's okay. She tried to threaten me that she was going to get her money back, etc. but... it WAS in the contract that if she didn't leave it clean she'd lose her deposit. 

NEVER renting out again.

782,yes,EntitledPeople,2021-05-14 00:44:28,amrjs,A guy takes advantage of my twin with TBI by stealing a lot of money from her,"Trying to keep this a bit anonymous, but we'll see how this goes. 

This features my Twin, her Entitled Friend, and my whole angry family.

Back when my twin and I (28F) were 8 my twin got a brain tumor, and that plus the treatment after it, resulted in what is essentially a TBI. She's very trusting of people, she's got the maturity of a ~14 y/o, and it's impacted her congitive abilities (eg. IQ etc.). In our early 20s she started taking classes with other girls who had brain injuries of different kinds, because due to her brain damage she did not technically finish middle school. This school also had other classes for people who did not have this type of injury, and where able-bodied in all senses of the word, but just interested in a particular class this school offered.

At this school my sister made friends with a guy. I heard about him from time to time, though I did not like him because he was pushing her boundaries in ways that made her uncomfortable, but she was unable to set those boundaries for herself. One time after school they were hanging out, and she was taking money out of her account and he somehow was able to see her bank balance. Due to her disability she'd recieved compensation from her insurance, as well as a small amount of money each month that my parents helped her save for future expenses (she lived at home and we wanted to build a solid base for her in the future, because she's never expected to work a full-time job). What does an entitled person do? Ask for money.

This guy starts pulling a sob story, about being behind on rent and bills etc. And he ask to borrow money. A lot of it. I'm not going to say the amount but it was more than the average month's rent in this city. My sister told me that she felt off about it, and didn't want to, but because she's one of the kindest people you've met, and because she didn't know she could say no, or how to say it, she gave him the money. 

After, she texted me and I could feel the sadness and shame she felt for doing it. When she told me she'd given him a lot of money, I expected 1/3rd of what she gave him. It's been about 8 years and this still breaks my heart. I told her that she had to tell our mom, and she had to get the money back. Our mom was furious, because this entitled ""friend"" knew that my sister had a TBI, that she was unable to say no, and that she couldn't see why she should say no when he asked... and he asked her for that reason. 

My parents immediately contacted this guy to set up a payment plan, and threathened to go to the police if he did not pay. He did pay back a small sum of what he owed (I think it was 1/10th), and then we never heard from him again. We never went to the police, I think because we knew that we didn't actually have a case. She gave him the money, even though he manipulated a person he knew was vulnerable, and unfortunately there's no law that protects against that. 

Since then my twin has gotten better at asking questions, and has never lent money to a friend again. She's occasionally been stiffed on a movie ticket because she paid in advance and they never paid back, but that's nothing in comparison. She also knows we have her back. Since then she's studied hard in school, and actually has a job, now which is amazing! She's made it through a lot, and there's more than this one guy who's tried to use her cognitive disability against her, but this one really really took the cake and ran with it. 

I hope he's out there feeling guilty about taking money off of a disabled person. He better sit with that guilt for his whole life.",7,33,33,0.98,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='nbw6s4')>,,/r/EntitledPeople/comments/nbw6s4/a_guy_takes_advantage_of_my_twin_with_tbi_by/,False

In the mean time, I’ve found myself overanalyzing everything I do and think.

For whatever reason, whether I’m starting to unmask, notice my tendencies more, or I’m internalizing symptoms and signs of Autism, it seems like literally everything I do lines up with either common Autistic experiences or symptoms. The more I think on it, the more it feels like everything about me is caused by something, instead of just being who I am. My interests are stereotypical, I’m more aware of how oddly I move, I can’t stop overthinking my thought processes. Even in therapy, I’m more and more aware of how many of my problems can be explained by me being Autistic.

If I have to see your Easter celebration signs on the corner for a month after Easter has passed, you should be fined. You should be fined for littering, and it’s easy enough to figure out who put the signs up, due to most having phone numbers or addresses or websites. Hell, if you put something like flags on public property, you should be held responsible for either getting rid of them eventually, or replacing them once they’re inevitably damaged if you intend on them staying. Your signs and displays should never become the job of others to clean up. 

There needs to be some kind of punishment for people who leave public space littered with ugly, irrelevant signage, for people who put stuff out and just let it rot.

For medications, I’m currently on 10mg methylphenidate IR, 27mg methylphenidate ER, and my doctor is working with me to swap me from 20mg Fluoxetine to 20mg of Lamictal. I also take a combined birth control pill (Blisovi/Tarina FE 1/20). 

From my psych, I was told that the interaction between the bc and Lamictal would be minimal. From my doctor at Planned Parenthood, I was told that Lamictal can interfere with bc and make it less effective, and that I should use backup protection. From my pharmacist, I was told that my bc would be unaffected, but that I should take my Lamictal a few hours after my bc, because the estrogen would cause me to metabolize the Lamictal more quickly and I wouldn’t get the full effects.

I’ve always been obsessed with weird names because of some of my family members, and this sub reminds me of them constantly, so I had to share. 

Everything boils down to my Great Aunt losing her mind after the death of her first husband. Supposedly, she watched him get killed by the mob, but I…kinda think she made that up when she lost it. Anyways, my Great Aunt legally changed her name to Meta Earthling. Somehow, despite being convinced that Bigfoot is an alien and saying that she’s friends with him, as well as how she’s been abducted by aliens several times, she went on to remarry and have a few kids. 

These poor, poor girls were doomed. They were named by a woman who, one Halloween, dressed as an alien with full chicken wings in her hair (the whole family had farms) and did acid because marijuana made her cough too hard. They never had a chance. So, the world was blessed with Vesta Light, Nova Lotus, and Reality. 

I complained a lot as a kid about never finding keychains with my name on them, but learning about my Great Cousins shut me up real good. 

I’ve never met my mom’s cousins, but have tried to look them up, and all of them changed their names after Meta died. Frankly, I can’t blame them. (EDIT: they didn’t change their names I just suck at google and couldn’t find them lol) Sometimes, I catch myself thinking that Reality sounds metal as hell, but I could never curse a kid with that name.

I already have Odyssey and Origins in my sights, and have been looking into the older games.

Don’t get me wrong, I love the stealth kills in the game, but I love having the option to just go crazy with my axe. 

I’ve seen mixed reviews for Valhalla from diehard AC fans, everything from saying it’s the best after Black Flag, to saying it’s one of the worst. From what I’ve read, it looks like Valhalla, Odyssey, and Origins are laid out in a different style than the originals, with more of an rpg, open-world focus.

So, instead of relying on gaming journalists and dodging spoilers, I thought I would ask here. 

Experienced AC fans, how does Valhalla compare to the other games when it comes to gameplay? Are the first games open-world, or linear?

My family owns a tea business with multiple brick and mortar locations. We have a ton of glass in the stores, everything from vintage tea cups, to tea pots, to mugs. Luckily, it’s super rare that anything gets broken, and everyone jumps to apologize and pay when something breaks. I’d say that I’ve had to deal with- maybe -three broken items, in the five years I’ve been full time in the shops. 

Recently, one of our locations had a woman and her daughter (confirmed for 21+, not a kid) come in. While they were there, the daughter picked up a ceramic mug with a ceramic lid, the lid fell on the ground, and it broke. She was mortified, and did pay for the broken product. She is not who I care about. 

The problem is her mom. Her mom, who has now gone into the location, noticed that there is no “You break it, you buy it” sign, or any signs that warn customers that glass breaks when dropped. The daughter doesn’t care, the mom is foaming at the mouth, though. She has decided to insist that, since we didn’t have any signage up, we set her daughter up to scam her out of $20 and she is threatening to sue. (I think she’s mentioned emotional damages)

I have found absolutely nothing that indicates that she’d be able to do such a thing, and want to laugh in her face, but I’m being told to cater to her every whim and to try to persuade her to not sue us.

I have been diagnosed with ADHD-c mostly off of extremely inconsistent school performance when I was a kid: if I found something interesting I could learn it easily and retain all the facts forever, but if something didn’t interest me I couldn’t  (and still struggle to) focus, I daydream constantly and looked for something that would interest or stimulate me. This involved destructivity and hyperactivity that would annoy my parents and teachers. I also had impulse control issues that nearly got me arrested several times that have gotten better but I still struggle to use any sort of social media appropriately. This all sounds like run of the mill ADHD, and ADHD meds help somewhat. 

But I have also always felt very uncomfortable in social situations, like I just don’t know how to act appropriately. My default were either over the top behavior that others found annoying (I learned to control that as an adult) or shutdown (in a corner by myself/fleeing). I can fake being normal for an hour or two but I hate it. So as an adult I don’t really socialize at all if I don’t have to and I really have no friends outside of my immediate family. I have 3 interests I am extremely obsessive about and I can’t imagine not being able to pursue them. I have a job that fits one of my interests and I am pretty good at it, but I try to find excuses to avoid socializing with
my coworkers. They are good people but it just feels awkward and stressful for me. 
I am also married with three kids, and my youngest and I are extremely similar. She was a really challenging child behaviorally since birth (just like I was) so we started seeing therapists and eventually a psychologist and at age 8 she was diagnosed with ASD without intellectual or language impairment. She is now 13 and the similarities between us are only more apparent now (with the main difference is she no longer has any violent outbursts that I continued to have until age 20).

My wife and other children are now convinced I have ASD either in addition to or instead of ADHD-C, and I suspect they are correct. 
My question for you all is do you think this is something worth pursuing with a psychiatrist? I realize it would be better for my family if I was less obsessed with my routine, and I do wish I had friends. I feel like I know how to make friends but what I have to do to make friends-hanging out, making small talk, planning things isn’t worth it. Basically the idea of changing the way I am and who I am at this point in my life is scary and I am resistant to it.

I also quite latterly can't speak on time and misplace words and sentences it wouldn't work even if wanted. But my friends are going into the server and doing debates but I don't got access to the same channels because you need to level up by having these conversations. I asked the moderators if I could be allowed in to just watch. My first couple where answered then he asked what I needed and i explained only to then have my texts where intentionally being ignored. I couldn't access DM bots and got told I was lying to which i ignored. I got asked to explain publicly, which is embarrassing but I did. Even after I explained they wouldn't budge or respond. Then got in trouble for reposting (cause it was so fast I wasn't being answered or even seen) My friends can't do anything cause they don't control what happens. I'm wondering if anyone has advice in this situation on what to do or if you know where I'm talking about to help. thanks.

Growing up my language skills where borderline low and they refused my accommodations outside of speech therapy and OT I had no communication devices given.

 I went from talking a bit, to shut down entirely by the time I was a teenager I wasn't socializing and my language had not changed. I only recently started putting together the real story not some blurred memory of everything once my teacher in my adulthood gave me my old papers and we discussed the problems. 

Now I'm an adult (29) with poor education [They failed this to shocking] and lived my entire life up until recently not knowing why I could speak but was still struggling to get my words out and why I sometimes use the wrong words. Why I take so long to make a sentence that I want to make without messing it up. On the surface you probably wouldn't notice anything but once getting to know me you do. 
I type perfectly fine though, and my speech seems fine to but I can tell somethings wrong.  

I always could In my old pappers it stated i had a expressive language disorder. Today you'd call it a developmental language disorder. I knew I had taken speech but I never knew of the disorder that I had nobody told me I tried to write a post on this before but wasn't very clear with the problems but I was also very angry I'm calmer now but not happy.

Now that I know the problem I'm asking for help. I want to know as an adult if there is anything I can do because I'm sick and tired of being behind everyone else's speed when taking and I'm sick and tired of being stuck using the wrong words and being misunderstood. 

But I don't know what to do because i'm rural so there's almost nothing out here and what is out here is ABA. [Which no thanks they've done enough damage] I also have no idea who takes adults because most everyone here takes kids and ontop of this I do not drive or have support. But I'm frustrated and I'm tired of being frustrated. 

I know some people are probably going to be like well. What's the problem you can type?

821,yes,DataHoarder,2022-02-13 22:16:08,reeper150,I found an indescribably important HDD that was thought to be lost forever!!!,"For background, when I graduated highschool in 2011 my father bought me a 1.5 TB HDD as a graduation gift. He put many movies on it for me to watch while I was away at college. He recently passed away. 

Between 2011 and 2016 I put everything of importance on that HDD. I majored in music performance in college and all of my performances, lessons, masterclasses, and practice sessions were recorded to a video camera and put on the drive. When I took time off from school and moved to Paris, I took over 10,000 photos that were all on the drive. I hoard rare Beatles recordings, and over 6,000 unique recordings of the Beatles playing were on the drive. I briefly worked as a flash game developer and sold my games to make a living. The games were all my own coding and artwork, and they were on the drive. Precious videos and photos of friends and family were on the drive. My favorite stand up comedy show, which has been out of print for over a decade was on the drive. And all of this just scratches the surface of what all was on that drive. 

6 years ago when I moved from my townhouse back to my family home due to health issues, the drive went missing. I was devastated beyond words. None of the data had ever been backed up due to both financial and logistical obstacles, and an ""It will never happen to me."" mentality. My grandmother had helped me pack up all of my stuff and clean my townhouse when I moved out. And I had also been letting my troubled younger brother live with me as well. As my grandmother couldn't identify a PC component to save her life and my brother stole and sold everything he laid his eyes on, I always figured that either she had thrown it away or he had stolen it. I have spent years bitterly obsessing over what happened to the drive and lamenting how I had lost so much of my life. 

Yesterday I had to take everything out of my storage unit because the floor was not installed properly and it had fallen in. Everything had to be pulled out, so that the company could replace the floor. It was a 7 hour endeavor to get everything pulled out and sorted. While sorting I found a green fabric bag that was tied shut. Out of curiosity I opened it. It had a brown paper bag folded inside of it. And I immediately assumed it was some decoration like a statue, and very nearly threw it in a box, but curiosity got the better of me and I opened the brown bag. As expected there was bubble wrap wrapped around something inside. As I pulled the bubble wrap off, I saw something unexpected though. It was an antistatic bag lined with foam. My stepdad was standing over my shoulder waiting to see what it was, and my mom was sitting a few feet away watching curiously as well. I peeled the bag back to see some kind of ports and my stepdad said what is it, to which I replied, ""Oh it's just an old video card."" Then I pulled it out of the bag and said ""No. It's a hard drive...... Wait! IT'S A HARD DRIVE!!! IS IT!?.... IT IS! IT'S THE HARD DRIVE I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR FOR YEARS!"" I jumped up and down like a little kid and almost started crying. Suffice to say that it spun up, everything was on it, nothing was corrupted, and it is all backed up to my 28 TB RAID that is currently syncing it all to my backup server.

Main priority is performance in the sense that it can run 24/7 to host a small server and needs to be capable of handling a modest Windows 10 virtual machine. I have a tablet so I don't need a 2-in-1, and wouldn't use a touch screen at all either. Battery life and build quality do not matter at all.

Not at all.

Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.

N/A

Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.

No.

If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?

I tried switching the network switch ports of the 150 Mb/s machine and the 450 Mb/s machine but the speeds stayed the same, so the ports have nothing to do with it. Can an ISP throttle a specific device on my network? I am at a loss and use these devices for work and need them running faster than they are. Any advice is appreciated. I am at a complete loss.

His spokesman today says he will renounce his Norwegian citizenship sometime next week and has already been approved for US citizenship under the Extraordinary Individual clause.

Magnus is close friends with New Yorker and YouTuber, Levy Rozman (Gothamchess) which he said was a huge part in him going through with it and why he chose New York as his home.  Also New York overtook Moscow’s title this year as the most competitive chess city in the World, which almost certainly factors in to Carlsen’s choice.

In Norway Magnus was a big fish in a small pond; it was just a matter of time before he needed to spread his wings.

There seems to be a strong human instinct to believe in a higher power, and I think aliens are quickly becoming a proxy for this in a society with declining religiosity.  I’ve seen people become outright hostile with me just for saying we don’t know if aliens exist.  They call me arrogant and naive for questioning the authorities.  Carl Sagan and Neal deGrasse etc invested their whole life to this work so of course they are going to exaggerate their certainty.

889,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-05-25 17:16:12,Independent-Alps7271,Isolation feels easier,"
I’m NB afab and 28. I realized I was on the spectrum a few years ago but am only now starting to accept it. It’s so lonely. I know no other autistic ppl. I know that could potentially help but I’m so exhausted and depressed. Sorry it’s a long one, there’s a tldr below. 

It’s not that I can’t find joy in some interactions it’s that I have to wade through so much anxiety and confusion to hit upon enjoyment. It makes interacting feel scary and not worth it. I live alone and don’t work and leave the house on average once  a week (this has gotten more inconsistent) for groceries and to do laundry at my moms. My sister also lives there. I have no adult friends besides them and a new one (my first one that’s not family) I’ve been solely texting because in person is too hard. Even with her I told her I had to take a break due to issues with isolation. 

I really love my mother and sister. I don’t know what I would do without them and their support. I like my new friend, she’s so kind and funny! But interactions always feel…well bad. 

I’m able to unmask at times with all of them but I usually end up feeling ashamed and confused about even being a person? Like hearing my voice can be nails on a chalkboard but I compulsively keep speaking and seeking reassurance (I also have OCD) then just spiral. I always cry around them and get ‘existential’ as they may say. I’m just so depressed and confused about myself and life it’s all I can focus on. I think of it as an unstoppable overflowing. It has to come out and I’m powerless to stop it. I feel like I’m too much and not enough constantly. I feel like nobody knows me and my pain. I just want to fix it maybe but obviously talking doesn’t help. Makes it worse honestly but I can’t stop. 

I feel Infantilized often. Even though I know it’s not intentional and there’s no Ill will behind it, obviously it still hurts. As if I’m just a little baby who just doesn’t get how to be a person yet. But I feel I’ve never known. 

With my new friend I struggle to feel I’m enjoying our friendship even though I know I like her and the things we talk about. My body just feels so tense when speaking with them and after interactions I pick them apart endlessly worrying I did something wrong. I always think I did something wrong and ppl just won’t tell me. Reading between the lines is exhausting. I’m struggling not to break it off out of fear and exhaustion. 

TLDR: It feels easier to isolate. I’m incredibly in my head all the time when alone and it’s hell but it feels like a “hell you know” type of thing. It’s preferable to the strain of interaction. 

I feel like I never know what is expected of me!! I’m simply tolerated. I feel like I’m in a damn play and don’t know my lines. I know I’m loved but I don’t feel loved. That I’m a black hole and it just gets lost in me. I feel like nothing. Nobody. 

I don’t know what I’m posting this for except desperation and a potential for advice. I feel so lost and lonely. If anyone has similar experiences please share.

If I like you i don't care what are in your pants, I'm only interested in you as a human being and depending on your own preferences and your equipment we will do diferent things. On the other hand, if I had understand correctly some people only feel atracted sexually to someone when their gender are align with an specific kind of private parts. TBH this feels kind of odd from my point of view, but also makes me think...

Only talking about physycal preferences, we know that you can't choose what atracts you and what not, if you don't feel sexually atracted to redheads or people with green eyes that can't be help it. That can be tremendously superficial and shallow but not morrally incorrect, the same way that a lesbian girl can't suddenly being atracted to men.

It’s taking a toll on our relationship.","My (39M) partner of 3 years is suspected to be autistic by our couples therapist that he hasn’t gone to in about a year but I still see. He shows many characteristics the biggest ones being a very negative reaction to intense emotions (especially mine) to the point that he literally physically runs away from me, and hypersensitive to any real or perceived criticism. ANY … it’s impossible to have a conversation with him about anything negative even when I try as hard as I can to use all the communication tools I’ve learned in therapy. He usually blows up and if the topic is specifically triggering he becomes verbally abusive. 

I (34F) am diagnosed ADHD and have my own triggers and issues, especially with rejection sensitivity which is the icing on the cake since he is minimally affectionate and while most days I know he loves me, it’s very difficult to actually see it. 

Anyway, I’ve spoken to him several times about my concerns for him as well as for what it’s doing to us as a couple and he’s just not having it. He refuses to go to a psychiatrist or even back to therapy with me. When we first went to therapy it was going well until it started bringing up feelings for him he just could NOT handle. 

We’re both Latinos which adds another layer of stigma to mental health which plays a huge part in his reluctance, since any kind of neurodivergence is seen as “crazy” and “lack of motivation” that can easily be fixed with faith and determination so that doesn’t help the situation at all. Not to mention it makes it nearly impossible for him to understand MY issues and MY meltdowns at all. I recognize he doesn’t have the tools yet to understand or manage it but it’s really hurting me. 

I know that inevitably if this doesn’t get any better I will need to walk away, but I would really like to find a solution. He was my best friend and has been my ideal partner in every way and I just don’t know how to move forward from here. I know if he doesn’t want to help himself there’s not much I can do and that it’s not my responsibility to do so, but I would really like to find a way. 

Has anyone been effective at getting a loved one to treatment? If it was you, how would you want your partner to approach it? Any other advice for me that would also help preserve my own mental health?

896,yes,lostgeneration,2022-10-18 15:38:53,cyborgmonkey-,Update to dental work in Mexico.,"Brief update to my prior post. For those who asked, yes I came to Tijuana. I will post more details on the dental office as I get further along.

Yesterday I flew in to San Diego. A car service drove me to the dentist, then for a ct scan, then back to the dentists, then to my room. My biggest complaint is just that it was a long day and I feel lonely by myself down here. I have major social anxiety so this is way way way outside my comfort zone but the dentists and staff have been so understanding and welcoming.

Yesterday they took molds for the new dentures. Sure enough they found bone fragments that gentle dental had failed to remove. They also took before photos and will take after ones so I will post those at that time and started preparing the dentures and adjusting for size and fit. I got to pick out my tooth color and length, and I believe they are adjusting for a more pronounced underbite than I used to have. I was so tired from traveling and heat and anxiety that I was really depresses when I finally got to the motel. A long nights sleep was much needed.

The entire staff and drivers are all great and even though I can't wait for the comforts of home I know already that this was the right call. A rough few days to end years of suffering.

Thanks all for your support! It's especially helpful right now. My wife would have come with me but because we live in the US we would lose income and child care for the week which we cannot afford.

Luckily I believe I am in good hands and further believe that this was the right call. It is more and more apparent how the US dentists are a joke who just draw the process out to pad their bottom line.

I am going to get glasses while I am here and maybe even have them lock at a few other issues too since health care is so much more accessible here.",16,77,77,0.99,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='y7afef')>,,/r/lostgeneration/comments/y7afef/update_to_dental_work_in_mexico/,False
897,yes,lostgeneration,2022-10-13 22:00:49,cyborgmonkey-,I just scheduled dental work in Mexico. I have feelings.,"My family has bad teeth. My boomer dad didn't want money ""wasted"" on medical bills for me. I got fed a constant diet of sodas and didn't learn the importance of caring for them. So about 5 years ago I noticed major cavities and pain developing. The dentists have been so expensive. They want to fix this bit or that bit while they all continue to rot away and the pain gets worse now matter how many times I've said to just pull them all!!! 

They also want to treat me like a junkie and refuse me pain medicine for the pain they could fix by actually pulling the teeth like I said to do years ago.

Even when I got my lower teeth pulled the dental assistant was actively hostile. Slamming things around, heavy sigh when I accepted the dentists offer of nitrous. Then the asshole turned it on max and ignored me asking for a reduction until I ripped the thing off.

Every doctor says pain meds are someone else's problem AND that they can't fix anything without a million damn appointments.

I was up last night in pain. Crying. Hating dentists and doctors and US ""healthcare."" What a fucking joke.

I'm desperate and even though I live in the richest country on the world no one will actually help now. 

I called a dentist on Mexico. I'm going to spend 8 days alone in a foreign country while undergoing procedures and a can't fucking wait just to be out of pain.

Not only that, but the whole trip, including airfare, hotel, teeth pulling, and new dentures, will be cheaper than JUST the teeth pull in America. It is going to get me out of pain faster and save me thousands.

Thank god we don't have universal healthcare where we might have to wait to see a doctors or pay more. Edit: Sarcasm.

My country does literally nothing in the interest of helping or protecting me or my family So no I'm not proud to be American. I'm fucking embarrassed and pissed.

His abuse was easy to see. My mom played a victim/hero and gaslit me on so many things while playing this hero for ""protecting"" me from him. There were also 3 older kids from his side and 7 from hers. They got plenty messed up too. Unfortunately too much to be healthy for me to be around now. They use similar manipulations and I've never had any moments of real connection with any of them. With exception of 1 brother when I was young. No ill will to him but we aren't in touch. Dads kids resented me cause I didn't get beat. Hers resented me for getting attention from her. Also the closest was 7 years older lived with his mom mostly (sadly she was awful too). Sorry this is so long. There's just so much.

So I'm the golden child, baby, resented, alone, and my job is pretty much to absorb her limitless need for attention. Meanwhile I am basically invisible and I know it is not right but my reasoning like partitions itself off. At nearly 40 went NC with ALL but the brother. Best holidays with my wife and kids, not stress, but sadness though. Therapy, meds, emdr. Previously I've been in therapy for 3 years with 2 IOP trips and permanent marks left from self injury. Doing better.

But...

I can't say I have ptsd. I have recurring dreams going back 2 years. Constant emotional flashbacks. I had body dysmorphia from her. Medical neglect. So so many examples to prove it. But nothing scares me more than being like he. What if I'm the delusional one? What if I'm totally self unaware? I also hang up on others like my brother who had it worse (probably?) How can I complain when so many have had so much worse? 

I just want to get past, move on, stop hitting panic any time I start to sleep because I will ""be back there."" And stop triggering all day. I don't even feel like I deserve to cry about it.

908,yes,raisedbynarcissists,2022-01-13 19:28:40,cyborgmonkey-,Boring nightmares and flashbacks?,"I’ve been diagnosed with CPTSD by a couple of different therapists and doctors. Both of my parents were extreme narcissists. My mom was covert, so her abuse was more subtle, and my dad was just an asshole and proud of it. It’s been years of therapy and medications. I finally went fully NC not just with them but also with my equally damaged siblings. I had been their black sheep target of abuse for years. 


For about a year or two now I have been having these strange recurring nightmares. It started with insomnia, then these extremely vivid dreams that would be erased from my memory almost immediately.  But after more than a year of them I’ve gotten enough snippets to know that they are dream recreations of various stages of my youth and young adulthood. The dreams themselves are all innocuous like getting groceries or something mundane, but there is always this sense of despair. I know that there are some that are scary or intense somehow because they wake me up when I try to fall asleep but I can’t recall anything of them whatsoever. I realized that I spend half the day dreading having to sleep again.


On top of that I have little split second flashback memories with the same despair emotion all day long. These memories can be of dreams, or real memories, but they always just suck emotionally no matter how bland the memories are.


I’ve been undergoing EMDR therapy so I assume that is stirring stuff up. I really wish I could find a way to get an understanding of these dreams and move on. I want to enjoy my life now instead of being stuck in the past that I hated.

912,yes,raisedbynarcissists,2021-11-24 16:47:20,cyborgmonkey-,I went no contact. I feel so much better.,"It was about the third time she brought up my 8!!!! year old son’s weight, always because she was trying to “help” since “other” people could be mean. I already had to overcome body dysmorphia myself. That alone had me ready to cut contact. Then in the same conversation she said “I’ve never been critical” and I laughed out loud. She acted offended. I started calling out things she had done including the bs comments about my son’s weight, just like she had done with me. I had previously started compiling a list of various mean comments and things they had done to me. With her it was covert so it took me until now, nearly 40, to see the extent of the damage. I went to the list and just started listing stuff off to her. I kid you not it was like the scene in the movie where the shapeshifter is dying and shifting through all the forms it took. She went to tactic after tactic after tactic just getting more and more desperate when I didn’t take the bait. 

At last I said “Don’t expect a call.” Hung up. Blocked her number. Then I sent a text to my narcissist dad and told him he had never once acted like an actual loving father and that I was blocking him too.

That was it. I felt free, like I could breathe, but I also felt guilt, particularly toward her, because that had always been her favorite hook to use. I would wonder if she was upset, but I would also think that she is probably absolutely giddy inside from the drama she can milk out of it with her friends. Then I’d think of the damage she would do to my son given the chance and I would get angry and more determined. Even if I felt some guilt I had no choice when it came to defending him.

My wife was very supportive right from the get go. She never liked them and hated how they acted to me and although she saw the abuse she knew I was too stubborn if pushed and she patiently waited for me to see it. God bless her for that! I have a friend from when I was young who saw the abuse first hand and was supportive. My in-laws have been kind and loving and make sure I know I am part of their family. I also have a great therapist, mental health nurse practitioner (I just call her a psychiatrist because she is actually better).

I’m fortunate to have all that. I wish everyone did. They and the list helped me in moments of doubt, and I’ve continued to add to it.

It has been several weeks or a month since I went no contact. The first few days I felt like I could breathe for the first time ever. I did struggle with guilt as I mentioned. I also struggled with sadness and grief. I had finally let go of expecting them to ever change. I had to grieve for that loss of hope.

Now however, I am starting to feel much better. My wife sees it too and tells me I look healthier, stand straighter, express my needs constructively, and just generally have more confidence and more willingness to be myself. My compulsive spending even went down.

I literally look up more. Walking out of the local store I’d be looking at the car or the ground. Now I walk out and I see the mountains and misty clouds and sky.

It was a drastic step but it was the right one. Society constantly tells us that we can’t do that. That we have to put up with it. We don’t. I hope those of you who read this and need to take that step will find the strength and support to pull through it. For those who have done it and still struggle I hope you find relief.

I wrote this post in hopes that it could bring hope to those of you facing this decision. I’m not saying it is always the right call, but if you need to make it you should not beat yourself up.

All through childhood. They would yell and scream, my mom would come tell me all about how mean my dad would have been to me. Then she would lean on me for emotional support.

On the other hand if I expressed anger or sadness it was always immediately dismissed as unimportant.

My wife is soooo glad they are gone, but sad for what I'm going through,

Despite what I logically know emotionally I'm not there. I question and doubt myself. But then  always come back to the countless nasty things they've done and said.

They're divorced now. He is off playing as though he did nothing wrong, and she has still been trying to lean on me for all her emotional needs. She gave me body dysmorphia and was aready trying to be ""helpful"" because she was ""concerned"" about my 8 year old sons weight.

While I've been on disability and in and out of IOP she still wants to tell me every sad detail of every person she knows and every illness they have and how sad it makes her.

Regarding my dads abuse when they divorced, she said ""I was abused for 30 years.""

I replied ""Yeah me too.""

And then she said ""Well at least your young and still have lots if your life left.""

She also gaslights and considers herself a saint so she can't understand why I could possibly be mad at her. It's so frustrating questioning my sanity when i know for a fact I'm not crazy and other people saw and said the same things about her.

“You’re just like your mother!”

These were never good comparisons.

If one half was bad, and the other half was bad, did that mean I was just bad? 

I remember being pulled from bed at night, after the usual yelling, and taken with my mother to her friends house. “Are you going to get a divorce?” I don’t know how old I was, but I knew what it meant.

“No sweetie, it was just a bad fight.” I felt such disappointment.

“I wish you would.” 

Then she was away, detailing all the drama to her friend. I could hear them talking, light coming in from the hall.  Her friend collected porcelain clowns. There were shelves lining the walls. Dozens of creepy clowns, a strange bed, more fighting but no hope for an end. It was the bright moon that comforted me.

Ten older siblings. Three from his prior marriage, and seven from hers. His were regularly beaten, hers were neglected or used for her emotional support. Most were already adults and scattered to the wind. There are none that I trust.

I remember being alone in the woods. Him and a truck, his usual scowl. We picked up my brother from a camp. They fought about me. There were only two seatbelts, so that meant I was loved better. I don’t blame my brother. He was a kid. 

When he ran, he was chased down and beaten, then dragged back to the truck where he asked “What about my bloody nose?”

“Use your sock.” 

These are my very first memories. My introduction to the world. 

Of my siblings, the seven on her side were the oldest, then the three on his, and then me, between the two of them. My previously mentioned brother was the closest in age. He spent some time with us, and some with his mother. I was somehow the youngest, and yet also an only child, with siblings who felt more like aunts and uncles.

He couldn’t beat me like he could his prior kids, but he did beat them in front of me. I’m sure they felt resentment. With her kids it was the fact that we had money and they had been poor. Either way I was the lucky “golden” child, left alone to watch it all fall apart, to be clung to by one and despised by the other, to be a nephew or brother whenever it was convenient, to be treated like a child and held accountable like a man, to nurture her wounds while enduring his since the time I could talk.

He was drunk and angry. They would yell and slam doors. There would always be disagreements about me. Then she would come and cry and tell me all the mean things he would have said and bask in the glory of protecting me from him.  All while I was comforting her.

I cry every day and desperately want to self harm.","I had a breakdown a few years ago when I was evacuated from my home due to a wildfire, while I got a call and told I lost a promotion to much newer employee who had quit and only been back two months. I don't remember the actual start of the self harming, but I was somewhere in that time. I think right after the call. It went on for months. Went to my boss for help, they forced me off work while I went through intensive and dialectical behavioral therapy. I returned to work, had a few issues, had to med change, went through intensive again, then I came back again. I started to stabilize, right as COVID hit.

I've hung in there. Haven't self harmed or been terribly depressed. Hadn't really wanted to. Still have been bored with the job though, which is part of the problem.

Now as winter sets in my boss, who I liked, is temporarily replaced with the guy who got the promotion at the start of it all. Added to that the guy replacing him is young and super new. He knows so much less than me about the job it is infuriating.

Supposedly this if for three months. I'm worried the boss I like will leave permanently. I can't work for these people like this. I am too bitter and angry and mad at myself. I have more experience, I have a degree. I'm not denying I've had issues but I was also jerked around a lot. I've never been promoted and my degree is just a big waste of money. I'm approaching forty and it has just made me angry. I told myself I didn't care anymore but seeing this kid be my ""senior"" just kills me.

I know I should be grateful to just have a job and be essential. And I am. But that's also part of the problem. I'm in a small town and need expensive meds. This is pretty much my only employment option.

So I'm trapped in this emotionally painful situation where I feel this awful combination of anger and sadness that makes me desperately want to self harm.

The honest to god only reason I am not doing it right now is because I cannot think of a way to hide it from my wife. I know that's a good thing but I am in so much emotional pain. I don't know any way to let it out. I cry every day on my way to work, or at work. I'm angry all the time. I can't even talk to my boss I liked who understood me, at least somewhat, because she isn't around and her replacement is the trigger.

My breakdown was too public. Now I'm doomed to be the office crazy guy who wasted money for a degree that would never matter. And I can't even get away from that.

I'm just so tired of feeling worthless and insignificant. Like a failure and a loser. Twenty years and a degree and I can't do something a young twenty year old can. What does that say about me?

She wanted wigs while she grows her hair out. We got her a couple for christmas. She wanted them but isn't wearing them. Maybe she just doesn't feel like it right now or yet.

But when I helped her put one on she said when looking in the mirror that she still hates her face. Before knowing I told her how handsome she was. She was. But also I honestly think she, and I apologize if this is the wrong word, passes?

How can I help her feel more confident about her looks? Or is this something that just takes some time? She does have a good therapist who is also trans so I plan to encourage her to bring it up then.

Thanks!

Second boss understood. But they promoted first bosses favorite who was also far less qualified. She just always liked him more.

At time of rejection I was evacuated for a wildfire. All around my town was in fire. Town in danger. Smoke so thick I couldn't see. Only big disaster I was ever around.

Home was okay. But somewhere along the way I started self harming. I can't actually remember the start.

After a while I told my boss and was forced on leave. Got inpatient therapy. Medications. Went back to work. Had am episode, forces on leave again. Then needed a med change. Preemptively took FMLA. Been back for about a year now.

Haven't self harmed.primarily because I can't hide UT from my wife and it hurts her so much which is not my goal.

Now. COVID. There were fires and smoky skies. Civil unrest. Election chaos. Difficult kids. And guy promoted is now covering new bosses job for 3 months. I resent him so much. Even newer guy took his job.

I will never be promoted. I never wanted this job. But I'm trapped by need for benefits.

I am so incredibly triggered because I see my future here and it sucks. I have to see it for 3 months. Then maybe new boss will he back. I hope. But still. She will leave permanently eventually.

I work in law enforcement, but I'm not a police officer or sheriffs deputy. Nothing so glamorous. I am a weighmaster. I am one of the guys who sits in the little shacks on the side of the freeway and writes tickets to truck drivers if their truck is overweight or something like that. I don't carry a weapon and my interactions are all civil. The worst I can do to someone is write them a ticket or put them out of service for a short while (which can only be done for very specific reasons like a suspended license for example, I can't just decide to do it).

So anyways, I am a straight white agnostic male. I have no problem with anyone's race, religion, or sexual orientation. My job doesn't require a degree but I have one. I was majoring in religion and philosophy but had to change to business when I changed schools. I still took many classes on world religions. American truck drivers come from all over the world, so I find it interesting to meet the many types of people. 

Unfortunately, many of my coworkers harbor prejudices. I've always managed to side step talk of politics or religion. I've worked here for 8 years, so I'm third in line in terms of seniority but because of a fairly public breakdown a few years back I'm destined to not ever be promoted.

So I have no authority over my coworkers, but sometimes I help train them. 

This girl has been here for a little over a year. She already kind of drives me crazy because she is just constantly interrupting me with questions, many of which she should know the answers to by now, and others that aren't even work related (like for advice on her husbands unemployment claim because I used to work at the employment department.) Sometimes she calls me over and over, like 5 times in 45 minutes. Making it frustrating when I'm trying to do my job. And sometimes, she wants to talk about things like politics.

She want's to complain to me about her son being taught a tiny bit about Islam in a history class. 

She told me she doesn't mind my more feminine looking lesbian coworker, but used an offensive term to describe one with shorter hair, who actually happens to be straight.

She doesn't like it when people have accents and says things like ""it's nice when they speak English for a change""

Social distancing? No way! This girl is so close it would make me uncomfortable under normal circumstances.

Today I was helping train her and I saw how she acts with someone who is white, versus someone of color. She was just tearing in to this poor Indian gentleman who had simply made an honest enough mistake.

I finally had enough and interrupted her to answer the man's questions since she wasn't answering them and was just, I don't know, getting off on her power I guess.

Afterwards she told me ""You're too nice.""

I responded, ""That's because it works.""

I know how this goes. If I go to management they just kill the messenger. I am actually considering trying to change my shift just to get away from her.

Some other weird light things with me. 3 times as a young adult I awoke in the morning to see a streak of light fly at me impacting my forehead (3rd eye?) and physically knocking me over.

Around the time of the beach incident I witnessed a massive meteor burn up on entry and light up the whole night sky.

I don't get people, I try but I don't understand how they're minds work and used to try to fit in but never did. I had some trauma in my early 20s that made me stop trying and since then I have lived alone with very little social communication. I find people scary I will avoid them irl because I'm scared of offending them and it turning confrontational, in that instance I will either lock up like my operating system crashed or just loose the ability to think straight making me talk loud/erratic.


I started painting models a couple of years ago and felt I did a ok job for a beginner but had nobody (friends or family) to ask if I was being bias over my own work, so I joined reddit. I posted my work and the response I had was overwhelming, I had never had positive reinforcement like that from anyone but my own mother, I literally cried with joy (it still makes me overwhelmed to think of it).

It was through my new found hobby and the kind people of reddit I eventually started to open up to people, I was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder in my early 30s and joined so I joined a reddit sub for social anxiety. It was in that sub someone surgested I may have undiagnosed Autism and suggested I took some online test.

I took those test and scored very high on them suggesting a high possibility I have some form of Autism. Since I did them (a couple of months ago) I have spent every day obsessing over what Autism is and reading/watching/listening to any information I can get.

I come to the point where I need to go see a doctor and ask for a referral to a specialist but I don't want to waste the time of a already overwelmed NHS.

I told my sister, and she congratulated me on the diagnosis. But she’s usually the only person that I can actually talk to about stuff and vice versa.

I sat through a meeting yesterday about how we’re being forced to come back to the office every day starting next week. And our executive director couldn’t even be bothered to stay for the entire meeting after dropping that bomb on us….but we got shitty pizza! 

And the really upsetting part is that he didn’t even actually say we had to come back. He sort of implied it . Which meant that no one questioned it at the time because we didn’t understand what he was telling us at first. 

And later everyone was like ’do they think we’re stupid? Music and pizza are not making up for this.’

I’m really trying not to fall apart. I won’t see my husband or my baby most of the time. I hate it here.  🤬

(I’ve already told my manager that I can’t come back next week. I need time to arrange childcare. And secretly find a new job.

Also the PowerPoint transitions. 😂

But what the heck was that ending about!!? 0 out of 10. 

1. Did they just not know how to end the movie?

2. And how come only Luke and Han got medals, C-3PO R2 and chewy helped too? Justice for the support staff!

There was no yoda in this one but that’s okay. 🧡

Edit: I have softened my opinion of the ending since it wasn’t a modern franchise with guaranteed backing for multiple films in advance. So the lack of major set up for a sequel is to be expected.

1. Do mandalorians often work as mercenaries? 
2. How would they actually build the Death Star? It’s the size of a small planet itself right?
3. How come these droids never told anybody what they already knew? Technically, Luke did ask who leia was. (I mean the C-3PO and r2 ones)
4. If leia was a political dignitary how come she couldn’t call for help when the troopers showed up in the beginning? And how are they supposed to get away with blowing up a planet?
5. If they blew up Alderan planet, how do they ever read the plans? 
6. It kinda seems like a whole lotta people are talking really reckless to darth Vader. Why are they so dismissive toward the force when he literally just choked someone with it?
7. Did they change the size of the jabbahuts? That one dude seems small.

947,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-03-20 17:58:24,LadyLurkerHandz,Emotional overreaction is exhausting..,"I (30sF) was diagnosed as meeting the criteria for ADHD and ASD very recently but I’ve known this about myself for as long as I can remember. 

I’ve always been very ‘sensitive’ and it’s been an issue for others. I’m mostly good at glossing over for other people’s sake. I can have a couple good weeks in a row especially during the warmer/brighter months of the year. But then something unimportant happens and the emotional meltdown is horrible for me. 

I honestly hate it so much. It makes me insanely jealous of ’even keeled me’ or happy me’ from the week before. It’s like living with a really good roommate and then suddenly having to move in with an awful new neighbor. And because I can’t force them (my intense emotional reactions and negative feelings) to move out, I have to live with them in my head.  Also because I do so much work to minimize the burden on other people, I end up internalizing a lot of it. 

I hate feeling so out of control and having to hide it because (insert here: coworkers, family, friends, etc.) would be inconvenienced by a visible/audible meltdown. But I think it would actually be so much easier for me to process and let go of if I could just let it be instead of suffering in silence.

This morning I was snuggled up with my husband before he left for work and I thought he would wake up and want to keep cuddling. Apparently he had a different idea.

When he grabbed my thighs and dragged me down the bed I could see how hard he was. He took off his boxers and told me to“open up”. I started to gently lick his shaft but then he rammed it all the way down my throat! I gagged and tried to breathe around him but he said he needed to fuck me good before he left for work so that I would feel him all day long. 🤤

I tried real hard to lick his balls while he fucked my face to get him ready for my pussy like he wanted me to. At that point I didn’t need it since I was already dripping wet.

I don’t think he meant to do it so hard but once he felt how wet I was, he spread my legs further and told me I needed to get fucked like a slut. So he did. I just needed to cum so bad. He tells me all the time that he likes my pussy because it’s deep and tight, that way he can bottom out inside me.

He pounded me so deep that I thought I couldn’t take it anymore. But then he grabbed my throat and squeezed, telling me he was fucking me how I needed to be fucked. That made me cum so hard. 🫢I think I passed out when he decided to cum on my face, because when I woke up he was already playing video games. I’m sore but I feel amazing. 

Before he left I kissed his cock and balls and told them to have a great day.

Corvettes as... brawlers, i think..? Medium ranged weapons, cheap armor, focus on evasion

My reasoning is that battleships still do the thick of the damage, but needs an escort against small torpeders, so the destroyers protect them from missiles, and the cruisers kill enemy torpeders.

I’ve always preferred just to be comfortable rather than stylish. I suffer from extreme discomfort with tight, restrictive clothing, and constantly being hot and sweaty.

My impression is that many people are almost offended when you don’t dress a certain way for a particular occasion. Work and formal events in particular.

With regard to work, the last few years has been great because I can work from home and wear anything I want. Shorts, T-shirts, shoes optional, (naked from the waist down if I really feel like it…). I still get the job done and I’m perfectly comfortable and at ease. I don’t have to constantly re-tuck my shirt, feel restricted by belts and tight shoes, etc.

But why is it that when I have to work from the office I’m expected to spend an hour ironing my clothes, wear a tucked in collared shirt, dressy shoes, … to do the exact same thing that I do at home? And everyone just goes along with this unnecessary formality without questioning it. Do NTs actually not mind this?

Where I live, the climate is constantly very hot and humid, but that doesn’t stop people insisting on wearing suits to formal events, work functions and the like. Suits are designed for cold (European) weather, not harsh subtropical climates. Again, it’s completely illogical but almost everyone just goes along with it.

It was only in the last year that I started to seriously consider the possibility that I might be on the autism spectrum, so recently I sought out a clinical psychologist who made a formal diagnosis.

After a lot of reflection, there is no doubt that the social anxiety I have always experienced is a direct result of being autistic and all the challenges that go with that (struggling to socialise, form and maintain friendships, being socially awkward, etc.)

I’m wondering if anyone has been in this situation before? Now that I have an explanation/validation for the way that I feel, I am less inclined to see the need to treat the social anxiety and instead just embrace that autistic part of my brain. In other words, care less about trying to fit in and live an overly sociable life, which previously I thought I had to.

I have been getting help with social anxiety over the last year, but recently have begun to think that the anxiety is something secondary, and that the underlying cause of it is possibly being on the spectrum. My parents investigated this when I was very young, around 4-5 years old, but the outcome was either inconclusive or did not come up with any diagnosis.

At this point, I’m basically 50/50 on the possibility that I have high functioning autism. My GP agreed that there is a possibility I would be on the mild end of the spectrum, and supported my decision to get formally assessed.

However I have some concerns about getting diagnosed as an adult. The older I have become, the more well adapted I have become to all the complexities of forming relationships, success at work, etc. and being self aware enough of my autistic traits that I am able to mask this to ‘fit in’. I wonder just how sensitive/adaptive the testing is to this? I fear that I would struggle to really display or communicate to the psychologist the true struggles that I have faced my whole life, because of the success that I have had in masking a lot of these traits.

I have been dealing with social anxiety for several years now, beginning in childhood but becoming very pronounced around age 19 when I started university, which was a big change from the safe, familiar environment of school. I was always avoidant of social situations, especially in large groups, loud environments or with new people. I would need to constantly prepare myself before social situations by ‘rehearsing’ scenarios beforehand, and using alcohol and other substances such as phenibut to take the edge off. I pushed through nonetheless, and tried to ‘fake it’ for a long time, and still managed to have a fairly normal social life and career. But recently it became harder to deal with, including feeling the physical effects of anxiety such as GI issues, hands shaking, difficulty keeping eye contact, etc. I went to my GP who recommended I see a psychologist and begin with Lexapro.

Benefits

So far the effects have been subtle but noticeable in some ways. Overall I feel calmer and my mood has improved somewhat. My mind is less frenzied. Thoughts that previously would have kept my mind racing now seem to subside within a few minutes and no longer keep me up at night or immediately occupying my mind first thing in the morning. I recently went to a NYE function with a new group of people, and not only did I feel much more comfortable but I was more talkative than usual, despite not drinking much. I feel like I can just go at my own pace without worrying about what might happen in the future. My noisy neighbours kept me awake the other night, which would have previously made me stew and feel irritable. But I calmly went next door the following day and asked them to keep it down. Previously this sort of encounter would have made my heart race and I would have been prone to getting flustered and upset and probably coming across as aggressive.

Side Effects

First week: nausea, dizziness, insomnia, sudden reduction in sensation ‘down there’ but still normal libido. Overall feeling out of it.
Second week: Better overall, with no nausea or dizziness. Much more fatigue, but sleeping well. Libido has probably reduced somewhat. Some lack of motivation about work and going to the gym. Ironically, anxiety was probably one of my bigger motivators when it came to work, so I will need to try to push myself a bit more in future.
Overall, pretty easy to deal with so far.

I’m feeling optimistic about the whole thing. Hopefully it continues to improve in the next several weeks. Thanks everyone!",0,6,6,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='rx0z9l')>,,/r/lexapro/comments/rx0z9l/my_experience_so_far_2_weeks_on_10_mg/,False

I’m currently being testing for autoimmune diseases and I currently know I have autism (which can cause sleepiness) and fibromyalgia, (which also can) but I feel like I shouldn’t be THIS tired. As the days and months go on I feel like the tiredness just gets worse too. Ive even had days where I’ve slept over 14 hours. I’ve tried fighting the tiredness and I just end up yawning for sometimes hours before I just give up and lay down. I can be in bed all day doing nothing and still need a multiple hour nap. The weird thing is for me is this tiredness last from morning to late afternoon then the rest of the day I’m usually wide awake and have lots of energy. The only way this doesn’t happen is if I’m out doing something extremely engaging, which I can’t do every single day due to life and just pain somedays. I’ve been put on multiple medications for sleep currently I’m on hydroxyzine which does help me sleep at night, but doesn’t get rid of the day tiredness I get.

I am making a post here because I think this is an important issues and so ppl are aware and will unfollow this account. 

@FloofNoodles aka @FriendlyQuest you most definitely have seen. They are most known for the ferret dancing with Pikachu. (idk how to spell it) They recently came under fire for starving their ferret that has insulinoma to death. They were aware of their ferrets sickness and let them, and their other ferrets starve for 2 days. Their reasoning for this is “because they couldn’t get their food” and using their mental health as an excuse. This in itself is very bad, but they proceeded to make a tiktok with the deceased ferret for what? Clout? I can understand not having money in the moment but this person has over 15 million followers! If you take a minute to look at the account you can tell he makes enough to buy their food. They have also received over 1 thousand dollars from others for this issue, and apparently did not not use the money to save this poor ferrets life. They have also been seen giving non species appropriate foods to their ferrets, such as asparagus, strawberries, pizza, and giving bad ferret care advice. If the abuse this person shows to their ferrets isn’t enough, there has been evidence of child grooming. There has been leaked DM’s between this individual and literal children talking  inappropriately.

But I think the federal discount rate will need to rise to match the 8.3% inflation rate most recently reported in August 2022.

In 1975, when inflation reached a local maximum of 12%, the Fed raised the interest rate to 8% in an attempt to kill inflation, and while inflation did drop temporarily, this interest rate proved to be insufficient to kill it, as inflation hit a new peak of 14% in 1980. It required the Fed raising rates temporarily to a matching 14% to finally send inflation back down to normal rates.

This pattern of central banks needing to raise interest rates above the rate inflation to kill the inflation holds true for other countries, such as Germany and France around the same time periods.

In the period after 1980 until 2007, the federal discount rate was held above or approximately equal to inflation to suppress inflation and keep it around 2%.

The August inflation rate in the US was 8.3%. Shouldn’t the fed need to raise rates to around 8% to kill the new inflation?

#Parameters:

- Tows 6x10 cargo trailer that weighs average 1800 to 3500lbs max.
- Ideally fuel efficient, but cheap purchase price can substitute.
- <$10,000 budget.
- <170,000 miles for reliability’s sake.
- No trucks because weather where I live is very rainy, tools would get wet in bed.

#Good examples: 

- 2007 Toyota Sienna. Good fuel mileage, reliable, watertight, can fit 4x8 pieces of drywall, tows 3500lbs (all 2004-2007 have tow package, 2007 has bigger engine). Average 19 mpg. Needs oil cooler pipe replaced to avoid catastrophic engine failure but otherwise very reliable. Current first choice. But good ones are about $9,000 and I’d like to spend less if I can.

- 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee. 4.0l engine is reliable. Gas mileage slightly worse 17mpg but cheaper purchase price, $6-7000. Tows more than sienna. Less cargo space. Fits other criteria.

- 2003 Chevy Blazer. Similar to grand cherokee.

#Bad examples:

- Ford Transit 150 would be super ideal but is way too expensive.

- Ford Transit Connect doesn’t tow enough and expensive

- 2003 Dodge Durango cheap but not very reliable and low mpg.

- F-150 or other truck won’t work because open bed=wet tools=bad

- 2007 Honda odyssey. Generally good but most don’t come with tow package.

First, there have been four recent changes in my life that have caused a lack of quality socialization.  First, I grew up as a reasonably moderate protestant, but have become more atheist over time, to the point where I would now classify myself as a near gnostics atheist. This has removed socialization through church, and a few close relationships. Second, I am completing the last semester of my senior year in a computer science online college. Not only is it the most difficulty I have ever had with school in my life, but you also don't really make very close friends with your classmates in online colleges. Third, I have just recently left home, which removes the automatic socialization through family. I still have some family nearby, but they're somewhat different idealistically (as far as I know). Fourth, I just got a part time job with a landscaping company, which requires that I get up before 6:00 on three days of the week. This requires great discipline on my part, which I have done okay with so far, but it definitely doesn't make it easier. All four changes have wreaked havok on my social life. 

Second, I have been incredible unsure of what I want out of life. 

I will give a selection of what appear to be major goals that people have in life. One seems to be religious fulfillment. Another is to become parents, and do a good job at it. Another is to work very hard and make lots of money. Yet others look to become famous through their work. Some work just to get by and live on the weekends.

Among these goals, I really am not sure which I want to pursue. A loss of religion has removed that avenue. Having a wife and kids seems nice, but a bit difficult to reach, as I haven't even been out on a date. It's not that I'm unattractive, it's just that I've always been quiet, and haven't really thought to actually ask a girl out, since the ones that I was attracted to didn't seem to show any particular interest. Or maybe I was just bad at seeing it. As far as money and fame, I'm kind of split. Will working myself heavily in the name of professional fulfillment make me happy? On the other side, will working a much smaller amount, with less money and fame, but a lot more time will make happy? I don't know.

So, I'm stumbling around trying to keep myself healthy, am unsure of what will make me happy, feel moderately powerless to achieve things that I think of and don't know where to find kindred spirits to relate with on a deeper level.

Things like depression, irregular sleep/eating schedules, skipping class and avoiding people. Anyways.

I'm back home and I just recently had an interesting conversation with my father about a conversation he had with a very successful (and really cool) doctor/inventor we know. My dad mows his lawn and stuff, and our families have come close be because it has been a good relationship both ways.

They recently had a conversation about life and the future. In that conversation somehow the topic of me dropping out came up. The doctor was concerned for me (personally, I think it's because he went through similar things as a college student). So my dad told him about what I was going through and how I had gone in for counseling. The doctor at this point became rather upset and said, with a strange amount of force compared to how quiet the doctor normally is, ""They didn't give him any damn drugs did they?""

The doctor went on to explain how he thinks that depression is an emotion like any other (although perhaps more extreme than some others) and that it should be an indicator of when I should be making changes in my life. He thought it is not something to be medicated. 

/* Personally, my opinion is that though there are individuals whose brains may not be functioning properly, the high incidence of depression, especially among college students, makes me think that it is more normal than I previously thought. */

My special interests are psychology and religion, so naturally I'm very interested in the many places where the two meet. I've recently stumbled across this idea that a large part of what motivates people to participate in religious group activity and attaches them so strongly to their particular tradition is this seeking after and enjoyment of collective effervescence (a phenomenon where individuals in groups can begin to feel and act as a group rather than individuals). I've read that people seek after this experience instinctively to develop and strengthen social bonds. This has been posited as a possible explanation for group religious experiences of connectedness with a god or gods, the holy spirit, etc. It also is thought to be part of why people in modern times enjoy group activities such as sporting events and concerts, which have shared mechanics and psychological effects with religious group activities.

The kicker is, I hate this feeling! I've experienced collective effervescence and it felt like my brain was hijacked by a stranger. I also don't care for concerts or sporting events, but I always assumed it was because of the overwhelming stimuli. Now I wonder if it also is due to my avoidance of this phenomenon. Also, despite religion being a special interest, I am not religious. I've tried to participate in multiple religions and join multiple religious groups due to my high interest in religion, but none of them ever fit for me. I'm curious if this is an autism thing, but I can't find any data online, anecdotal or otherwise, about autistic or even other neurodivergent opinions/experiences related to collective effervescence.

1123,yes,rpg,2023-01-27 17:14:38,FlamingPhoenix24,Different types of Old School?,"I've been the forever DM for over a decade now and I'm starting to really reflect on what kind of games/systems/rules I enjoy. I heard about OSR and at first was excited to dive in, only to realize what OSR means by old school and what comes to mind when I think old school are totally different.

I grew up on D&D 3.5 and crunchy CRPGs from the 90s and early 2000s. Old school to me conjured memories of character driven, dice roll heavy, sandboxes with a heavy dose of dungeons ala Might and Magic, Morrowind, Fallout, etc.  I know I am talking a lot about video games when referencing table tops, but my D&D groups growing up were heavily influenced by them. Knights of the Old Republic was basically my D&D primer and how I modeled my early campaigns.  


I realized after reading the old school primer and looking through the rules for AD&D and OSE that when it comes to TTRPGs, old school means almost the opposite of what I grew up with. Things are more rules lite with heavy emphasis on role playing rather than dice rolls, and player skill rather than character skill. This may be a contentious thing to say, but OSR games seem more similar to D&D 5e than they are to D&D 3.5.  


What I'm getting at here is what do we call this style of game I grew up with and want to play more of? If I were to eventually design my own TTRPG in this vein, what would I call it if not old school? 2000s crunch? I haven't really heard a term for it.  


I wasn't around in the 70s & 80s when the games OSR is based on were popular and haven't actually played one myself so I may be ignorant in some of what I've said. I am honestly having a hard time understanding all of these different types of play and how to communicate to others in the community the type of game I run so any help here would be appreciated.  


tl;dr What do we call 90s/early 2000s TTRPGs if not old school or OSR? Can crunchy dice roll heavy games be considered OSR?

One has played D&D once with no other TTRPG experience, and the other has never played a TTRPG, but both are familiar with common fantasy tropes from books and movies. Originally, I was going to run it in D&D 5e, but I've grown tired of that system for various reasons beyond even the recent debacle with WotC and would much prefer to pay GURPS. My friends are open to this, but don't really know the difference. I don't want to overwhelm them with crunch and turn them off from TTRPGs altogether, but the way I run GURPS seems simple and intuitive enough for them. I just can't look at it with clean eyes after playing and running various TTRPGs for over a decade.

I will provide them with simple templates for races and a list of basic careers and skills used in this world. I am not using encumbrance and any other such complex rules I've homebrewed simplified variants of. What do yall think? Is a very simplified GURPS ideal for newbies, or should I just suck it up and run 5e for them?

EDIT

Just for clarity, I did ask my players about having me make pre-generated characters for them based on a concept they wanted to play, but they said they didn't like that idea. Building a character was an exciting part of the game for them that they wanted to do themselves. I was making custom race templates anyway to help flavor my homebrew setting, so I figured it may help them, but use of them would be optional, of course. I don't really want to do class/career templates because the way they are done in the example from the basic set pretty much builds the character for you, but I thought of making class/career talents.

It is high fantasy set in the mythic period (distant past relative to my previous campaign in 5e) of my custom setting (Thauma). Since it is in GURPS which has a lot of old school flavor I like (I grew up on CRPGs older than me) and it is set in a more classic period in game, I wanted to give it some old school flavor. For instance, I'm making the class/race templates now and I'm giving the dwarves the magic resistance advantage, which also keeps them from casting magic, while elves will have the opposite advantage which makes them stronger casters but also weak to magic (that advantage name escapes me at the moment). I like the idea of having larger advantages with related negative trade offs, but I can't think of more of these at the moment.

Do you all have any suggestions for more old school flavor? It could be the concept above or different ones. It could have to do with races/classes but also other things.

I am wondering about the dungeon fantasy book. How does it stack up to D&D? I've heard that D&D does fantasy better, but GURPS does it well along with anything else you could throw at it, but does anyone here prefer GURPS for high fantasy? If so, why exactly?

Additionally, is it recommended I get dungeon fantasy, or would it be best to just get the basic set since I also want to run games in many different settings? My main draw for dungeon fantasy is the included race/class templates, so please let me know if the basic set has templates or guidelines for making templates for my players. I feel GURPS will be a much easier sell if I can hand my players a race/class template of their choosing and let them finish from there rather than building their concept from scratch.

After reading some replies and giving it some thought, I've decided not to get dungeon fantasy or otherwise try to recreate the D&D experience with GURPS.

They had something to do with the fall of the western Roman empire, which seems relevant due to the highlighting of Italy in my dream. Also ""from the east"" could that be referring to Italy? Typically I don't think of Europe as from the east, but it is east from my location. I thought at first of the current protests for women's rights in the Middle East, but the text said ""woman"" not ""women"" so perhaps that is unrelated. Maybe Italy/Rome is symbolic of the US?

In the dream, I tried to write these things down in my phone, but when I opened it there was text automatically pasted. It said, ""Counting the days of the goths, beware the woman of the east."" Then I woke up.

Some of my current thoughts:

The phrase ""the goths"" sounded odd to me. I thought it was referring to the modern style goth and because of this sillyness I almost didn't record the dream, but I felt compelled to. I did some research after this and found out the goths were a people. They had something to do with the fall of the western Roman empire, which seems relevant due to the highlighting of Italy in my dream. Also ""from the east"" could that be referring to Italy? Typically I don't think of Europe as from the east, but it is east from my location. I thought at first of the current protests for women's rights in the Middle East, but the text said ""woman"" not ""women"" so perhaps that is unrelated. Maybe Italy/Rome is symbolic of the US? I don't know. I just wanted to share some of my thoughts to provide a starting point. I also don't know how the moon and starts factor in, but perhaps that part could provide some context to the rest.

Today I stopped suppressing my tics and I’ve felt noticeably less anxious and I haven’t been clinching my jaw and grinding my teeth at all, which I’ve been doing allot lately. That makes me think the teeth grinding and muscle tightness was related to tic suppressing.

1160,yes,recruitinghell,2023-04-22 23:55:51,emdelgrosso,Recruiter Contacted Me Unsolicited & Ghosted Me After Talking Me Into Applying,"I’m (24F, USA) a young professional with a degree and a few years of experience. 

I keep my LinkedIn updated - more as a way to keep track of everything for myself, less for other people. 

I am very happy where I work now and have nothing set to give off the sign that I am looking for anything new- but understand that doesn’t deter recruiters. 

I was reached out to by a recruiter (team lead) about a month ago on LinkedIn that had actually typed up a message (I get the copy/paste, not-real-opportunities messages all the time, this one was real) to me. I had never interacted with a recruiter before. 

We exchanged a few messages. They explained vague details about a position they thought I’d be a good fit for, provided a job description, asked me to send my resume if interested, and asked to schedule a phone call to “learn more about me.” 

I scheduled a call with them. We had our call a few days later- spent about 40 minutes discussing the role, my background/education/experience, the salary band, etc. He sent me an email basically for me to agree I wouldn’t go apply to this position without going through him and I agreed. He told me he sent off my application. He didn’t give me a timeline or “what to expect.”

Then nothing- for a week. 

I emailed him to make sure I didn’t miss anything - and he said they would “ping” the company again that day, but that they just hadn’t heard back from them yet. 

Then nothing. 

I ended up deciding that this “opportunity” was not something I was interested in (multiple GlassDoor reviews for the place mentioned everyone crying on a regular basis at work because of how awful management was) and decided to just see if I ever heard back without continuing to initiate. 

Eventually, about 3 weeks after applying, with no follow up phone call, email, timeline, interview, etc., I got an email back from the recruiter saying the company “went in a different direction” and that he’d love to “work with me in the future.”

I had told this recruiter that I had never worked with a recruiter before from the get go. He knew he was not only making a first impression for himself and his own organization, but also for the entire field of recruiting as well.

It gets made again, picked up, and then on its way. It is delivered! Or so we thought… was supposed to be two bags, was only one. Just one little box of dessert was delivered- we didn’t order dessert. 

At this point- it’s an hour and a half after this journey began. We are so hungry. 

We call DoorDash and ask for our money back, and call the restaurant to ask for our order to be made a THIRD time. We let them know we were on the way to get it ourselves. (It isn’t very safe for me to drive at night so was hoping to avoid this.)

When we get there- this is the best part- the restaurant let’s us know that the first dasher that came watched them pack up our food and kept asking what each component was, then remarking how delicious it looked, and how hungry they were… the said they were suspicious it wouldn’t make it to us that round. 

We then had to pay for our meal at the restaurant and of course wait multiple days to get a refund from DoorDash.

I’ve been paid up to $35 an hour for my time (which they knew), so I thought this would be a sweet gig.

We met, I showed them the inner workings, the beautiful visuals, the summary sheets, etc. and when it was time to leave, I was handed a crisp $100.

2. Get all the dishes out of your room. Take them to the kitchen- you don’t have to wash them or load them in the dishwasher yet, just get them to the kitchen and out of the room for now. 

3. Get all the dirty laundry in a hamper and to the laundry room. If it won’t all fit in a hamper, just get it all to the laundry room. You don’t have to start this yet or even sort it yet, just get it out of the room. 

4. Make your bed. If it’s covered in stuff at this point still, move the stuff. Even if it’s to the floor. You want one big clear spot to work from at this point. 

5. If there are any clothes left, clean or still clean enough, get those all to the bed and do one run through to make sure none of them need to be donated. If some do, establish a Donate Pile. Whatever you’re keeping, leave there for now if the floor/closet/drawers are still chaotic. 

6. Now that all trash, dishes, and clothes are either dealt with or in preliminary stages of being dealt with, start at the door and start going through what is left. Work your way in a circle, clockwise or counterclockwise- tackling only what you can see without opening things. Don’t get distracted with drawer or closet contents today. If something needs donated, get it to the Donate Pile. If something has a home, get it to its home. If it doesn’t have a home, make a pile for it for now. 

7. Now that you’ve finished your circle, it’s time to finish putting clothes up. Hang, fold, etc.

8. Evaluate what piles you have. Get the Donate Pile into a bag/bags and put them in your vehicle or by the door. Or call to schedule a pickup. The other piles need systems / homes. If you have the means to go buy shelves/drawers/cubes/etc, please feel free. If not, we gotta do the best we can do. If that means bags or boxes for now, one for each category, that’s what it means. Then visit thrift stores or garage sales and obtain what you need over time to develop organization or systems. 

9. You should now have a clear bed, clear surfaces, and a clear floor. 
Vacuum and dust. 

You will at some point need to go through drawers and closets. This can be done another day. Today, you have a visibly tidy room, which will likely improve your mental health and allow for more “room” in your brain in future days to tackle the rest. 

Tomorrow, you can do the dishes and laundry.

(TW/CW: COVID, emotional distress)

In Summer of 2022, after a work trip where I was masked the whole time and had boosted weeks before, I got COVID for the first time. 

I was the sickest I’ve ever been in all my 24 years. Of all the awful symptoms I had, I was most scared about losing taste and smell. 

A few days in, it went. 

When nothing at all sounded yummy, I was craving chocolate chip cookies and my amazing husband went out and bought some to bake for me. And when I ate one, I couldn’t taste a thing. I cried and cried and realized I couldn’t smell anything either. 

Once I could bare to stand again, I took a shower. Desperate to smell anything, I grabbed my very favorite: a LUSH Comfort Zone Shower Bomb. I didn’t even really *use* it, I just got it wet and stood there taking the absolute deepest breaths in through my nose I could and I just couldn’t smell it at all. It broke my little heart. I stood there the entire time it took for the thing to dissolve just sniffing it and crying- hoping I could even get the faintest whiff of my favorite smell. 

Over time, my smell (and taste) came mostly back- very, very slowly. I have always enjoyed LUSH (from head to toe every single day), but after that experience- where I really did wonder if I would ever be able to smell again- it makes me so very grateful every time I get to use a Comfort Zone Shower Bomb again. Every time I smell it/use one now, it reminds me to appreciate even the small things in life like smelling. 

Just thought I’d share how a simple thing like a shower bomb has had such an impact on my life and encourage us all to take a moment of mindfulness and gratitude next time we use a LUSH product! 🫶🏽",12,63,63,0.83,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='10rerqv')>,,/r/LushCosmetics/comments/10rerqv/covid_smell_and_comfort_zone/,False

1176,yes,Advice,2022-12-31 03:19:23,emdelgrosso,How do I handle my invasive neighbor?,"Context: 
My husband (M25) and I (F24) (no kids) moved into our first home in April 2022. (Southern USA)

The couple that lives on one side of us (“our neighbors”) is older and retired, has lived here for 2x longer than I’ve been alive, have 2 grown kids that have each moved to opposite sides of the country that they don’t see often, and they don’t have any commitments/hobbies other than the husband painting as far as I know. All this to say they have a lot of time and probably less social interaction than they need. 

Situation:
Our neighbors started out very kind, albeit with a much more intense level of involvement with us and our goings on than I had ever seen or experienced but know sometimes people have “nosy neighbors.” But I knew they were kind and well intentioned.

A little bit ago, my husband bumped into them out and about and ended up casually mentioning that I had a medical test coming up. This happening has ended up creating the most overwhelming, frustrating, taxing interpersonal situation I have dealt with in my entire adult life. I know that sounds dramatic. Keep reading.

Since that first test, unfortunately for me, the doctors have found more and more concerning things and have assigned me more and more tests. I have had at least one upcoming test at all times for months at this point, always being promised answers if we just do one more scan/test/procedure. Every single time one of these appointments is approaching, I get a text message from my neighbors telling me I’m being prayed for and asking if I need anything. Every single time one of these appointments pass, I get a call asking me how they’ve gone. 

This has been well intentioned of course, but feels invasive and adds to my overwhelm. 
But I’ve navigated it. Until today. 

I texted her today to let her know how today’s test went so that she didn’t blind-side me while I am in public tomorrow (and so that I could control the timeline, knowing she is going to ask me soon regardless). 
She calls. I let it go to voicemail (my throat hurts from my test today, talking makes it worse, and I am fully out of socializing today) and she texts me asking to call her when I can. I let her know I’m in pain and emotional and will call if I feel up to it and appreciate her caring. 

THEN! My doorbell rings. I’ve been recovering all day. I feel awful. I have been crying all day. I don’t want to socialize. It’s 9 p.m. 

I send my husband to go send her away. She insists she “just wants to hug, doesn’t have to talk.” He knows the shit storm he’d be in for if he made me talk to her, so he kindly said he’d pass on hugs and got her to leave, and then…

SHE. CALLS. MY. FATHER. 

Who I do not live with! 
She doesn’t know my dad knows anything about my medical things. 

This is so far beyond and past anything I am okay with. I feel totally violated. I feel frustrated. I should not have to carry this emotional burden of handling this. 

I can’t handle this the way I feel inclined to because I have to live next to them for an indeterminate amount of time. 

What do I do? What do I say? How do I handle this? Please give me any ideas at all. I’m at my wits end.

“Blank Church:
Where Jesus Ain’t Woke”

“Other Blank Church:
In [name of town] as it is in Heaven.”

What makes the second one so nasty- is that this community is a VERY white, conservative, wealthy, cishet, straight, white-picket-fence and 2.5 kids city with very very low crime and the kind of place that says “oh we don’t have those problems here” when ideas like community fridges, drug or sex education in schools, or suicide prevention programs are brought up. 

And I’d venture to argue that the person of color we called Jesus who spent his time with “the least of these” would actually align quite closely with what most would define as “woke.” (Just googled “woke:” alert to injustice in society…)",17,49,49,0.98,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='wi7bmd')>,,/r/Exvangelical/comments/wi7bmd/two_billboards_in_my_hometown/,False

I'm in a situation where I have no license or car and a bike with no storage my narc doesn't have access to, which means he can and will pop the tires as often as he can, which means I'll either have to keep getting them fixed or continue relying on him for rides unless I can finance a car (which he historically has also sabotaged), which obviously takes funds away from moving out and extends my time here...and so on.

That alone makes it daunting enough to find a ""cover job"", because he'll make it as difficult as possible to even maintain it, but he'll also be able to predict how much money I'll be getting and be especially invasive of/manipulative with my finances and purchases, even if I keep them personal, as I have a right to do.

I barely even trust him not to mess with my things while I'm out of the house, so naturally I'm hoping to move out as quickly as possible. But knowing I have very little way of transporting things, other than a UHaul truck (important note to remember as I'm writing this), and that he plays games with money and likes to stalk me, how do I even begin looking for a place that he won't know about? How do I keep the address secret anyway?

I've had roommate offers from a few contacts before, and I trust them. I'm not especially willing to put them in his path, but maybe I could arrange a safehouse situation, where I have a facade place he knows about and a second, real place he doesn't. Might also be very pricey and take a while to get to, but maybe worth it if it means he's not forcing my reliance on him and his involvement in my life anymore?

If I can even figure out how to safely get to and from my job and how much I can tell him about anyway (preferably *nothing*, but it's a cover job, and I might have to come up with a cover for the cover...)...

How have you who have gotten out handled it? How do you manage to get into a privately-known new place and go no-contact and not let them know at the same time? Worried he might do something like trick the keys out of me so he can copy them, because I do tend to be fairly naive and manipulatable and he has a known habit of going through pockets and stealing/misplacing/copying keys, and I'm fairly sure he'd stop at nothing to get access to wherever I'm living unless I can reasonably prevent it.

1187,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-05-24 17:36:21,The_Teacat,Has anyone's family ever used a meltdown against you and/or lie to others about what actually happened?,"I've never talked about this one but it's happened a few times with mine, who are very conservative people who don't really believe in special treatment for things like this, and believe that if you're not on their side, you have to be Stockholmed until you are. Any sense of self or personal identity is not quite allowed and will be used against you unless it serves them. I'm still recovering from a lot of it and it's impossible to predict how much unwiring I already have to do, but I tend to be their scapegoat since I fight against it as much as I can.

But yes. I know there's nothing ""wrong"" with me, but they like to manipulate certain reactions out of me so they can demonize me even more. Specifically they've done this with meltdowns and my attachment to sentimental objects about as long as I can remember, seemingly just because they can. It's set me back a *lot* and left me with trust issues as well as anxious and depressive issues I don't like acknowledging since I'm concerned that gives them a ""win"", and I don't like admitting they can have that affect on me. (And it gives them more ways to toy with me and overpower me.)

This happened as recently as a few years ago, during an event where I was having a small, personal crisis over a financial issue. I wasn’t very comfortable around my family at the time and was going non-verbal while processing it, but the main culprit kept stalking me around and trying to force an answer out of me. It ended up not well; I ended up screaming at him to leave me alone as I kept having to retreat further and further to try and find privacy since I was so upset and embarrassed, and all he would do was follow me and? Act like there was anything he could do?

I ended up getting cut a few times trying to get away and was in the process of dealing with that as well and he still wouldn't leave me alone and that just pushed me further. And some windows were broken and he lied to the police about what was happening to make him seem more sympathetic, and none of my family understands what was actually happening and how unsafe and in-danger and just plain upset I felt; when all I needed was some privacy to get my center back and process some shitty feelings. They just demonize me for it now and barely even talk to me; all I wanted was to be left alone during an obvious meltdown? A deeply embarrassing, frustrating moment that their forced involvement kept exacerbating?

I've been dissociating a lot since then, because it's hard to feel safe showing any emotion or vulnerability around them knowing what they might do. I have a very hard time feeling confident in myself, telling stories about things that have happened, and taking responsibility for things due to everything that's happened to me in situations like this. Am I the problem here? These are the people who used to hit me just for being upset with me, punish me for being upset about things, and scold me for basic emotions without understanding why I was so frustrated, and never really helped me in a way that didn't serve them too, so obviously it's difficult for me to feel comfortable showing these things around them, and it's easier to shut down, but it's obvious they can still exacerbate meltdowns when they need to use them against me.

Has anyone else's family done this or been like this? How do you feel safe when they know they can use basic aspects of your brain's wiring like this and when you know they're against you anyway? I've been trying to leave for a long time and they just keep finding ways to remove that ability from me and attempts to infantilize me to keep me further held back and control me/take advantage of me even further. It's not so fun and feels super not nice actually speaking, you know?

1188,yes,raisedbynarcissists,2023-05-23 23:28:00,The_Teacat,It makes me sad how troubled and stigmatized or outcast the children of toxic or narcissistic parents seem to tend to be.,"That's something I know I'll have to deal with in the next few years, assuming we make it that far. Knowing I was right. Knowing I'll be hated for the effect their actions had on me, and for the way I had to be in situations that weren't my fault. For the choices I had to make to survive the choices they made, and knowing how he'll make up all these wonderful things from my childhood (his version of it, anyway) while putting down the actual living version of me just because I wouldn't fall in line (and sacrifice the person I made myself into without him in order to work with and appease him, even though I don't and shouldn't have to do that).

He's already getting to a point where he's idealizing and memorializing a childhood version of me that never existed and a version of my childhood that never existed. Showing appreciation for things that never happened or that he barely even noticed at the time, if at all. But now that it's convenient to make these stories up and pretend he had a different version of me to treasure than the one standing up for myself and setting boundaries he doesn't appreciate, he's started doing it more and more, and it's hilarious how different our stories of that version of me are.

And there's no way I can really say different. ""That's not what happened,"" because I know it's not, but it just sounds and feels like he's talking about a dead child instead of working with the one that's still in front of him - the one he always cast off and humiliated and ignored until it was too late and we both realized the damage was already done, and he realized he had lost my trust and respect with everything I've figured out he's done to me.

So now he's clinging to a fake history and telling stories about the version of me that's still alive behind my back with all of his collaborators and the people who helped, and he gets to act like the perfect, loving father I always tried to believe he was, and I know that's just the way it goes. And I've accepted that. But it's sad. I know how many kids these sorts of things happen to.

I hope everyone here gets a chance to move on and realize how much value they have, not because they were given it but because they're here and they give themselves value for being here.",3,23,23,0.97,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13q4glp')>,,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/13q4glp/it_makes_me_sad_how_troubled_and_stigmatized_or/,False
1189,yes,raisedbynarcissists,2023-05-20 10:57:42,The_Teacat,"Not sure where to put this. Family member stole my property, makes excuses, plays games.","I'm in a shit situation and not sure what to do. A family member claims to have taken a box of important books of mine to the thrift store, but for various reasons, I don't believe they did. Now, I know that they *did* take the books; the box is gone, so in any of the four possible scenarios I can think of, it is definitely deleted and out of my hands.

They've been cleaning the area where I temporarily was forced to store them and I, in my attempt to assume I didn't have to specifically list an entire itemized inventory for them to know not to touch my things, assumed it wouldn't be included. In the past, this person has had a habit of taking other people's things to the garbage dump, including video tapes and useful electronics that were not their property, and only recently started ""taking things to the thrift store"", but I can only confirm that's their destination if I'm involved, and I recently have not been able to be.

They claim they ""didn't know"" the books were mine. As the majority of what they've been clearing out was their partner's property, and for various unfortunate reasons, a lot of mine is mixed in, *and* because I haven't been able to help in the way I traditionally have and needed to be (specifically for things like this), they had an easy excuse: ""There are lots of books around here that were just going unread, so I thought...!""

...1) there are not that many books. All of the books that there are were either hers or mine, and it was obvious which ones are mine. 2) This person *knows* I value books and do actively read them, but they personally are against such intellectualism and have been trying to offload things from their life as a means of self-preservation and power tripping, so of *course* you either need to be achingly overly specific (and have them do a genie routine and find loopholes in every single thing you say), exhaustingly involved (and open yourself up to their constant self-obsessions), or accept that your property is never, ever safe and they'll always have an excuse for it.

So, box of books is gone. The claim is they're at the thrift store, which I don't specifically believe due to past behavior and social track record of the involved individual. Upon questioning, they claim they're maybe willing to go there with me and see about ""getting them back""; I am unable currently to fix problems like this on my own, making it more infuriating that it might have happened at all. (They like to play games with my neurodivergences and attachments specifically to get meltdown-style rises out of me, and set my progress in life back constantly. This is not the first time something like this has happened, and it almost always follows a period of time in which they're *especially* narcissistically manipulative to drive me to the point of total isolation and grey rocking, so they can claim that I bothered them and follow it up with other events similar to this that are seemingly specifically designed to infuriate me for being uncontrollable and setting boundaries with them. Fun!)

However, again, I don't believe they took them anywhere but the garbage dump, but I am concerned that the whole thing is a game to humiliate me, waste my time, and get rid of my books that I need while laughing to themselves in their power trip. (It was known that they were my books; however, they weren't *specifically* marked and this person is very good at getting away with doing very terrible things with social manipulation, ""I don't remember""s, and ""I assumed"" this and thats. So, inherently frustrating as a person to deal with.)

So, I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to waste a Saturday and give them attention they don't deserve, knowing they very likely are not at the thrift store. I'd like to let the books go, knowing I might never see them again excepting if I try and remember what they were and hope to repurchase them. But some of them were valuable research copies I had filled with notes and study work, and all of them were necessary for my work; without them, I can't really get any of my writing or research done, so I'm almost completely out of ways to continue making money doing what I'm good at. (This is known to this person too, because I keep going on about how important these things are and how much I need this work, revealing *exactly* the things they can use to toy with me. 🙃)

It's infuriating that they would do something like this; not surprising. But the latest in a long line of similar behavior patterns against me. I can maybe spend this weekend with them trying to fix it. But there doesn't seem to be an easy win here. I was planning on spending this weekend working since this is my first one actually free in quite sometime, and I'm fairly sure this person *knew* that so of course they'd set me back like this.

But. Advice is definitely desired. What can I do? Is there anything I should be doing here? I've been high tension for days because of the sudden loss and change of plans and environment situations. Obviously it's not very pleasant.

Sorry if this isn't the right subreddit to post this on. I was going to post it to some of the autistic ones, but as the person involved is one of my n-family members, it definitely feels more appropriate for this one.

1190,yes,raisedbynarcissists,2023-05-18 15:55:44,The_Teacat,Bit of a vent...grey rocking is the hardest thing I know I have to do. There always seems to be so few real ways to adjust when no contact is no option.,"(ETA: Flaired as rant/vent because, although I feel like support might help, I'm not sure what would be most helpful. As you'll see, I do know most of what I *should* be able to do realistically-speaking, so I'm not sure about the advice thing, but I'm not opposed to advice at all. I also know that just talking about what has happened and knowing people have heard it helps validate the experiences, but that's no one's job except maybe a therapist...and the therapist racket in my area is, uhm, very much less than stellar and that can and has been used against me in the past, so...? Ahhhhhh? TFW your experiences lead you to overexplain and overthink everything.)

When they know every detail about you, when they're expert manipulators, when their plan for you goes back years and you're just beginning to realize how stupid you were, when you can barely move without them knowing. When you have to shut down and sacrifice when you've already lost everything, and when they use even that against you.

Grey rocking is the hardest thing you can do. Watching it all fall apart...hoping the next thing you do might help you get out. Knowing what it's going to cost you to help you escape. Realizing keeping yourself safe and hidden just isn't enough, all while exhaustingly keeping yourself shut down and as apathetic as possible to give them as little as possible. While everyone you cared about fades away because they can't help you and you can't even talk about what's happening, let alone save yourself. (They made sure of that years before I realized what they were even doing. I was innocent and stupid then, and it took me too long to catch on, longer still to figure out where their plans were going, and longer after that to figure possible ways out. In a game I never wanted to play in the first place.)

I read the guide on narcissistic traits (as if I don't know from experience already...) and good lord, it's terrifying how many specific memories seem directly referenced by the article. Although for me, it's a male parent...something that makes it even more especially humiliating to talk about, since - as in the article - he's very competitive and likes to screw with my grooming and self-worth habits, and what grown male adult wants to admit their own male parent is doing things like that to them? (My mother, while she was alive, was their other toy like this and she never even really realized it. I tried to help, but they separated us and she ended up not believing me at all. Probably should've ensured better security for myself and for her before I did that. But that was in the earliest stages of waking up to what they're doing, and when they began to realize I was realizing now too.)

I used to see a bright future, and I knew I was almost there. I can still see it somedays. I've always had parts of me *know* these things were happening even as I watched every opportunity I gave myself be stolen away and ripped apart, but I've always struggled with being slow and naive and it's taken me far too long to put the pieces together. Usually I don't realize what the goal was of a particular step in the plan was until hours or days afterward; and it's deeply unsettling to know there *is* one and more exhausting to have to spend hours figuring out what it is just so you can suggest ways to yourself to counteract and escape it. Or at the very least, hopefully survive emotionally long enough to see another day.

There was even a time they teamed up and were so much and so intimidating that I was completely convinced and *terrified* that they were going to kill me. I still think they might. And maybe that’s part of it. But I had no way to show an intention so I couldn't call for authority's help like my friends kept suggesting I do, and obviously I couldn't reach out to my friends for backup, as that's unfair, harmful, and not something anyone should really have to do.

But regardless, I lost what was left of my friend group that weekend. Leaving me with only everyone online I was smart enough not to talk to about it, and very little support overall. (Largely because I'm just not situationally-stable and secure enough to be able to continue maintaining friendships in a safe way, so I can't commit to anything, I can't provide anything, I can't make a single plan without knowing he'll ruin it as soon as he learns - or already have found a way to schedule my future just a few days ahead. One of the first and most regularly recurring ways I ended up losing *most* of the things I was once so on top of. - , so everything falls by the wayside.)

So much of the things on this list have happened to me...he even ruined me financially in a deeply insidious way, and in some other ways I've been trying to investigate just so I can figure out exactly what and how he did it, and that was one of the earliest ways I really caught on to what he was doing with me. He only recently decided to undo some of that (without telling me anything, of course, although by now it's too late, and I have very few ways of carrying on *without* relying on his involvement and continued knowledge of those things). He's still manipulating my financials and it's all I can do to figure out ways around it. I am 30 years old and terrified to even try and get another job for fear of what he might do with the money coming in, or how my personal documents might disappear behind my back again, or so on and so on...

Anyway. I don't wanna say I don't know what to do...I know what I *need* to do (maintain work, keep financials decent, figure out a potential safe roommate situation, learn to let things to and unfortunately have to sacrifice to be safe). And it's all the hardest things I can imagine. I know I'm holding myself back in some ways; certainly the apathy, long-term emotional shutdowns for safety's sake, and lingering attachments to things I thought would be safe and treasured but can only be used against me (and have, very recently and constantly) are huge detriments. But I can barely even leave my room without keeping a thousand different things in mind to keep myself ready to defend against his games and the overall plan.

I'm hoping I'll be able to be out soon. But it keeps getting worse. So we'll see. Hoping to hear back about jobs, and worried about what happens after that. (As more of my art supplies vanish, and recently, a box of books I needed and was actively using for research and my once-hopeful professional career...they always go after your passions. And always the ones that could help you/uplift you the most. I want to scream.)

None of it is where I wanted to be right now. I guess that's inevitable...thanks all for listening even a little bit. Talking and writing about it somewhere helps to some degree.

1199,yes,Dreams,2022-08-21 03:34:09,The_Teacat,Anxiety after strange disneyland dream.,"I dream a lot. Vivid visualisations and lucid dreaming come easy for me, so my dreams tend to be nearly-complete (if slightly strange) storylines in my head, usually like small movies or layered dreams, and while they're all mostly different and rarely even feature me at all, there are some recurring elements that have formed into their own little dreamscapes or nightly anthologies.

(Yes, I have a lot of dreaming practice. It's a very important skill for me to cultivate.)

One major element is Disneyland. I dream about different parts of an alternate version of it, different sections each time but always the same alternate version of it.

I've never dreamed about entering the park, though. Now I have, and it...did not go well.

The entryway ticket booths here are now in an enclosed room, like a security checkpoint at a small airport, and you have to run your bags through an x-ray scanner while they check your ticket like one too.

But my ticket wasn't working for some reason. My bag got stuck until they could verify the ticket, and I couldn't leave back out the front until they were sure who I was either, so I told my family to go on ahead while he fuddled with my ticket and I'd catch up when it was all settled.

Only, I eventually fell asleep in the ticket line. When I woke up, it was just past 10 at night and the park was still open but closing very soon.

He tried my ticket a few more times, my bag is still stuck, and finally, they call security, a team of two women and one man, who show up and take me to what looks like a dank kennel beside the bank on main street. I think things are going well, but the man leaves and when he comes back, he's holding a taser and they say I'm going to get tased so can I please stand still, and put a ""hot pad"" on my head, which looks like a defibrillator pad mixed with a blood pressure testing wrap. They tell me it'll hurt worse with it but it's harmless, and he tases me and I get knocked to the ground, my jaw clenched, and not least of all, I can feel this horrible burning pressure at the top of my head where I guess the pad must've absorbed the tase or something.

Anyway, I've never been tased but my dreams are as vivid as they come, so I can feel every inch of it and it hurts like hell. He tases me again before finally letting me go, and I'm able to walk back to the front gate. Management's waiting there for me with the ticket taker guy, and they're all still figuring out what to do with me, since it's just past 11 now and I can't leave until they let me in, and I'm just trying to figure out why the hell they had to tase me to figure that much out.

Manager and the ticket guy joke that I'm ""like that Tom Hanks movie where he gets trapped in an airport"". The Terminal; but I'm not laughing. It's late. My family's gone. And I'm stuck at the front gates of Disneyland for something I didn't do and no one can figure it out.

1213,yes,legaladvice,2022-06-06 14:08:57,vingtsun_guy,Neighbor wants to be build fence on shared property line,"Foundation - I live in Southwestern Montana. I own a property that neighbors a property that was recently sold. My property doesn't have its own drive approach, as the properties were previously owned by a son and father. We were allowed to use the drive approach - on public right-of-way - in front of the neighboring parcel by the previous, and the ""country road"" that follows is located on both properties up until we reach the area where we park our vehicle - meaning it started on the neighboring property, then crossed over into a property, before a sharp turn placed it entirely on the other property the rest of the way. We would drive approx. 65 ft on the neighboring property before being on our own property for the remainder of the way. New owners were not happy with that. They decided to build a fence to block our use of those 65 ft. While it was shocking that they would take such an action, particularly without giving us the heads up, we were largely ok with it. Our plan was always to build our own entryway, and to install those old fashioned arches at the front - we just figured we had other priorities right now, with regards to our home and our pasture, and we figured we'd get to it eventually. For now, we can continue to use the drive approach that is on the public right-of-way, and then make a turn and get ""off road"" to get into our own property. The drive approach crosses over a ditch, and this is the only way to access our property from the main road, right now. This is definitely a petty move by the neighbor, as more than half of the fence cuts at parts more than halfway into the road itself. 

Problem - the neighbors put the posts for their fence directly on the shared property line. In Montana, that makes us possibly responsible for half the cost of the fence and definitely responsible for the upkeep of the fence. Drama ensued when we contacted them and advised them we had not agreed to the fence being build on the property line. I even apologized for not reaching out sooner, as I'd not noticed it until I saw the posts, but told them we did not want to be responsible for a fence we didn't choose to build, and asked that they move the fence into their own property. And have now threatened to modify the drive approach on the public right-of-way to make it so that we can't use it to access our property. 

Questions - 

1 - Is it legal for a property owner, in Montana, build a fence on a shared property line without the agreement of the neighbor property owner - who, by statute would be also responsible for the fence? 

2 - How can we absolve ourselves from having any responsibility for the cost of the fence or its maintenance? 

3 - Is there a way to prevent the neighbor from altering the drive approach to prevent us from using it, until we are able to get the permits and complete the work of creating our own drive approach?",1,3,3,0.8,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='v64dr5')>,,/r/legaladvice/comments/v64dr5/neighbor_wants_to_be_build_fence_on_shared/,False
1214,yes,AutisticAdults,2022-04-22 16:35:32,vingtsun_guy,Out of bounds and clueless,"I'll be the first to admit I have a weird sense of humor. Things that people typically find funny are confusing to me. Things that amuse me, I've come to know, are not necessarily funny to other people. I make stupid jokes all the time, and the frequency of my sarcasm or social commentary/observations increases when I'm off my game - i.e. if I'm tired, if I'm sick, if I'm having a bad day, etc.

The problem becomes when I make jokes or comments that she doesn't find funny, but she won't tell me. It's like she expects me to read between the lines and know that she doesn't find something funny. I'm not very good at reading between the lines or picking up on nuances, as I'm sure y'all can imagine. So things go on until she gets upset, and no she didn't tell me outright that she didn't think it was funny, but she was communicating with me that it was and I should know. 

I am perfectly ok with not being like that.  I do have the ability to withdraw if I'm processing through something, but that tends to bother her too. So I'm caught between being my natural self, with the expectation that I should be able to pick up on something that's being indirectly communicated - which is so foreign to how my brain works, and perhaps impossible altogether, or refraining from that behavior - in which case, she still gets upset.

Our relationship is strained at best. She's 15 and has been in a RTF since October of 2021. We are in the process of getting admitted into a boarding school for her junior and senior years. My wife, her biological mother and also her primary ""victim"" of bullying, threatening, and intimidation, does not want her to return home to live. There is a lot of hurt within the family unit from our daughter's behaviors, constant lying and manipulating, playing crazy making games and creating general chaos, lack of accountability and her insistence that everybody else is responsible for the consequences to her own actions/choices.

Back story: approx. One year before I met my wife, I lost my son, my only child, in an accident. He was a few months shy of 19 when he died. I raised my son largely by myself, as his mother died from cancer when he was 4 years-old.

Last year, on my birthday, my daughter faked a suicide attempt over the loss of her cell phone - she'd violated safety rules about cell phone use for the 100th time. My wife describes the scene that she found our daughter in as ""staged"". Suicide attempt ""tools"" to one side, child lyjng over the blanket, a scarf she crocheted for me as a birthday present placed over the pullow to the other side. And I say faked because the story that she tells about what happened and what she supposedly did to herself are not backed by the physical evidence we found upon taking her to the hospital. Since then, it became a pattern of, whenever she was caught doing something she was supposed to do, she was suicidal. This also slowly evolved into comparing herself to my son, saying things like she knew I wanted her to have died instead of him - she never met him, has never been compared to him. And also implying that if she didn't get her way, she would cut her mother and I out of her life once she turns 18.

Yesterday was my birthday again. She called my wife, from the RTF placement, and asked if it was OK to call me. Then she called me - I didn't answer - and left me an awkward voicemail, wishing me a happy birthday, and asking me twice to call her back ""if I wanted to"". I didn't. 

I feel disconnected from her. Because of her actions over the past couple of years. All the lies, all the games. The multiple CPS complaints due to false allegations of abuse against both her mother and I. But most of all, because of the many times that she tried to use the pain I feel for the loss of my son as currency for her to get her way. 

There's a part of me that wants to say, ""you're the adult, act like it"". But my better judgment screams that, given enough range, she will continue to hurt her mother and I, because she can. Because she blames us for not allowing her to do whatever she wants, whenever she wants it.

My daughter faked/lied about a suicide attempt. The medical doctor at the ER confirmed that she did not have the physical injuries that would have resulted from what she claims to have done. The psychiatrist who admitted her to the psychiatric facility also told us that her story didn't add up, and she changed her story multiple times. Even my daughter, while she has not admitted that she lied, has admitted that she did ""it"" because she thought it would convince her mother and me to not follow through with consequences for her choices/behavior - she is losing her smartphone, after violating the rules for having a smartphone multiple times. My daughter has a history of faking mental health symptoms, but nothing like this.

She has been in the psychiatric hospital since April 16. All the while still claiming to be actively suicidal - that is, until it became clear to her that she would still not have her phone when she came home. Now she's ready to come home. She will be discharged on April 27.

My daughter will have a plethora of services put in place for her once she is discharged, including a neuro-psychological evaluation to determine if she has a developing personality disorder.

I just came out of a long (4 month) depression (I think it was burnout)

I quit my job and moved to mountains & learning yoga here. 

I used to make eye contact while people spoke and only when I had to think & respond I’d look away. 

Since I’ve come here- nobody knows me here - I stopped eye contact completely. People see me as weird. I can feel it in their behaviour. But that’s not bothering me. 

I’ve started stuttering & loose first few seconds of speech. 

Im part of a group, but I’m hardly talking to anyone unless totally necessary and no eye contact whatsoever.

-	Yesterday posted about wanting to get a diagnosis for asthma 
-	In reply, there were more people who had a diagnosis or were planning to get one, for Asthama (as ASD/ADHD comorbidity) 

I went in today ahead, got tested. I was nervous but got it done.
After doctor asked few questions, wrote 2 breath tests & a X-ray. 

Doctor said I have allergies & also somatic anxiety. 

And prescribed anti anxiety for panic attacks. I told him I don’t want anti-anxiety, and he noted anti anxiety as SOS. 

Other 2 medicines I have been prescribed are SSRI and inhaler for 10 days.

I’ve been called again in 10 days. I pushed back on anti anxiety, i called him about SSRI but he said I have to take it for 10 days. I don’t know what to do

- In reply, there were more people who had a diagnosis or were planning to get one, for Asthama (as ASD/ADHD comorbidity) 

I went in today, got tested. 
After a few questions, doctor wrote 2 breath tests & a X-ray. 

Doctor said I have allergies & also somatic anxiety. 

And prescribed anti anxiety for panic attacks. I told him I don’t want anti-anxiety, and he noted anti anxiety as SOS. 

Other 2 medicines I have been prescribed are SSRI and inhaler for 10 days.

I’ve been called again in 10 days. I pushed back on anti anxiety, i called him about SSRI but he said I have to take it for 10 days. I don’t know what to do 

PS— NOT SEEKING MEDICAL ADVICE. JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS. AND IF SSRIs are common prescription for Asthama. 

For anyone interested 
1- FeNO value (ppb) - 54 ( high)
2- Bronchodilator test - normal
3- X-ray normal",7,0,0,0.5,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='xc8avh')>,,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/xc8avh/asthma_2/,False

Pretext -  its been 5 weeks, 1 hour per week online (text) sessions with my therapist. They expect me to pick a concern to address. One of these sessions i messaged them in advance to lead. And they did. But still asked me to questions so i had to talk.

— How do you decide what to talk about?
— Is there anything you wont tell them?
— They dont diagnose, they’re not clinical psychologists. But unofficially they have acknowledged my symptoms 
—  want to know the structure of therapy, roadmap if you will. Is this the right way? 
— I think I’m masking when communicating with the therapist, how do i avoid that?  Feel like i want to manipulate my therapist to say something i want to hear. 
— 
— How do you stay motivated to be in therapy when its not working as expected & any other suggestions for someone new to therapy.

i want to grow & be better for myself, family & people around me. I want to approach life with managed expectation & attain success in whatever way its meant for me. And that why i started therapy.

I am from a small town in India and found a doctor in New Delhi for online consultation for diagnosis.   


although doctor said she only does face to face diagnosis and with a family member, I asked her if the effort was worth it. She said following:

&#x200B;

“I haven't seen a case of child or adult autism/asperger's who have sought diagnosis or treatment on their own. They are usually bought by family members due to associated issues like anxiety, OCD, depression etc. Which may mean that a person with a diagnosis of ASD would not have the emotional understanding of their issues (that is, ASD symptoms).”

”I am not saying you do not have ASD.. but the fact that you are thinking you may have it kind of goes against my hypothesis.”

“About support groups,  there are no support groups for adult asperger or ADHD in India. There aren't any professionals specifically trained to deal with cases of adult ASD. Adult ADHD can still be taken care of.”

“What I would suggest is that rather than going for a specific diagnosis.. keep in mind the current issues you are having as well as your concerns.. seek a clinical psychologist who can take a detailed case history and then decide which direction of assessment and intervention should be planned”

although Im not very comfortable posting her words here, I wanted to know what to make of it.  going to get a psychoanalysis done scares me & seems long shot.

Just looking for thoughts and clarity maybe…,"Just wanted to start by saying that I mean no offense by anything I’m about to say, and I’m somewhat new to my research into ASD, so I’m hoping to get some insight/perspective on this, and I appreciate any and all thoughts, opinions, or information. 

My husband and I have had a rollercoaster of a relationship as far as highs and lows, and not being able to properly communicate our issues and be in sync. I’ve recently started questioning if my husband is on the spectrum after a friend of mine was recently just diagnosed and had a revelation that a lot of his life struggles could have been better managed better had he known sooner, and it made me realize that my husband has a lot of those similar qualities. Once I realized this might be a possibility it was like this lightbulb when off and I started wondering if a lot of things I was getting frustrated with were because of the possibility of his ASD, and it made me see him in a new light (and even has made me pause before getting frustrated with him after realizing maybe he can’t help certain things). 

Here is my list of things that have made me question this:
- He doesn’t make a lot of eye contact with me, and when I’m telling him a story I often find myself saying “Are you listening?” And he snaps back “Yes I’m listening!?” 
- He gets a lot of anxiety when going to a new place, and always asks where we will be parking when we get there and is anxious the entire drive 
- He doesn’t like when plans are “sprung” on him, and it makes him mad and have caused several fights between us if my family invites us over “last minute” (aka a couple days away). 
- He always questions everyone’s motives and constantly thinks everyone is against him or is talking behind his back, even when they are not.  
- He goes through phases and obsessions over things, and it completely takes over his mind. For example: for months he played the same video game for hours and hours every day, then for months and months he obsessively watched YouTube videos about skateboards every night, then for a year or two he obsessively got involved in the QAnon cult movement online (it almost ended our marriage because it was affecting me and our kids). 
- He gives “squeeze hugs” where instead of gently hugging me sometimes he’ll squeeze me so hard that it hurts and I have to tell him to stop 
- He uses the same phrases in conversation constantly. 
- He doesn’t like anybody (even me when I’m just cleaning our house) touching his things, and gets very angry if he can’t find something of his. 
- (This one has caused a TON of emotional conversations and arguments between us) He doesn’t seem to understand how to comfort me when I’m upset, or even show any care when I’m sitting in front of him crying about something. He stares blankly at me or just says “It’s ok.” in a monotone manner. And when I say “I feel like you don’t even care about me or care when I’m upset” he always acts really confused and says “You know that’s not true? I love you”. It’s just so confusing. 

If you made it this far I really appreciate it. I guess I just find myself constantly questioning myself and constantly questioning if these qualities of his are part of a high functioning ASD.

1289,yes,jerseyshore,2022-09-24 23:15:58,Trashtvslit,"I’ve rewatched this show a billion times and can’t believe it took until this rewatch to figure this out (OG season 3, episode 2)","(Some of you probably already figured this out or knew this but just let me be excited for 5 seconds 😂) 

So everyone knows about what a gross dickhead Ronnie was in Miami (hooking up with girls and then going back home to Sam, calling her a c***, etc.). They go home. I assume just a couple short months later is when they go back to the Jersey Shore house that next summer. 

In the first episode of season 3 when they’re all moving back into the house, it shows Ronnie and Sammi getting ready and driving there together and picking their room and what not. They seem really “in sync” and really into each other, acting like a “team”, very affectionate, etc. They also were very against Jenni and Snooki and seemed to act like everybody in the house was on their side. 

By the second episode of season 3 there’s a BIG shift of energy between Sammi and Ronnie, which results in them bickering/fighting the whole end of the episode on the boardwalk and then again back home. Sammi starts crying and saying how hurt she was by Ronnie’s behavior in Miami (while they showed flashbacks from the previous season). She also kept making comments implying she feels “alone” and that nobody is there for her in the house. 

It always baffled me why it seemed like all of a sudden Sammi’s mood shifted and suddenly she felt alone from the rest of the house and was clearly emotional/hurt by Ronnie. She even apologizes to Snooki and Jenni very shortly after this. 

It only JUST hit me now, that I think they showed the house the airing of the first episode or two of their Miami season. 🤯 I read somewhere on this thread that they usually never let them do that but they did that season because they knew it would cause more drama (and right they were). This makes SO much more sense now 🤦🏻‍♀️ Sammi went from feeling “Team Ronnie and Sammi” to “Wtf is wrong with my boyfriend and maybe I was wrong this whole time…”",13,96,96,0.98,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='xn72t5')>,,/r/jerseyshore/comments/xn72t5/ive_rewatched_this_show_a_billion_times_and_cant/,False

- In the OG series when she made out with Pauly and then the next morning acted like she didn’t remember that ever happening and was asking Pauly and Vinny questions like she didn’t remember.

https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/s9jyj6/just_feeling_lost_and_would_love_support_dont/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

For months I’ve been avoiding talking to him about all of this because it always ends in a fight and/or me crying myself to sleep. For months he’s been sending all of his friends and family members articles and videos and memes about how Putin is helping trump to destroy toxic labs over in Ukraine and that he’s “not going to pray for Ukraine”. Along with countless antivax pages. 

I tried talking to him again about it today and I asked him if (god forbid) something we’re to happen to our kids one day (like a medical problem) would be blame it on me and say that I poisoned them because I got them all their regular childhood vaccinations. His response was “I already think there’s something wrong with *my oldest son who is 4”. He sometimes shakes his hand a funny way or doesn’t respond the first couple times you call his name. What if something is wrong with him?? What if it was from a vaccine??” After that moment I just broke down and cried and said I can’t do this anymore. 

I no longer can live my life in fear and anxiety, which is how he lives his. I can’t listen to the theories anymore. I can’t listen to his “facts” or listen to him call me a sheep and that I’m harming our children. I’m broken hearted because he used to be my best friend and I love him so much, but he’s like a stranger to me now.

When I was crying and telling him I can’t do this anymore, and asking him if he had anything else he wanted to say about our relationship, he goes “Don’t be so fucking dramatic.” ….I’m just at a loss of the person he turned into.

Edit: Wow thank you all so much for all of your thoughtful responses and your support. I didn’t expect this much of a reaction, and this group never ceases to amaze me with how supportive everyone is. This is going to be a hard road, but I’m ready to see where it takes me.

1301,yes,Petloss,2022-03-05 12:06:35,Trashtvslit,Delayed grief/extreme guilt. Feeling heartbroken.,"My 15 year old Yorkshire terrier passed away almost a year ago, last April. I got him when I was 13 years old (I’m almost 30 now). 

I still remember the day I got him: I had been visiting him for weeks (he was too young to bring home at first) and then I brought him home on my 13th birthday in a thunderstorm, holding him tight so he wasn’t scared. That was the start of 15 beautiful years of having him as the center of our whole family and we all loved him so much.

He was so kind spirited, energetic, hilarious, doofy, and adorable. He would run all over our yard chasing leaves or his tennis balls. He spent many hours outside with me while I practiced pitching for softball throughout middle school and high school. He was there for me throughout everything: divorced parents, friendships, toxic relationships, family parties, going to college and back, breakups, my engagement, pregnancies, new babies, etc. Our whole family adored him and every time someone came over they showered him with pats and love. 

In his older years, he (not surprisingly) started getting shakier, slower, sometimes snappy, barked a lot more. Sometimes I remember getting frustrated if he was taking forever to go to the bathroom and my baby was crying in the house and I’d shout for him to hurry up. The older he got the more accidents he had on the floor (it got to the point in later years where it was multiple times a day). Between having a baby and also being pregnant (and very sick) in that time period, I would often times get mad at him if I stepped in pee or poop in the house and yell at him about how I had just taken him outside or something. I would always later regret it and go cuddle with him on the couch and tell him how much I loved him and appreciated him, but I still would feel awful. 

At one point my mother offered to take him to her attached apartment (we live in a multi-family house) because my mom also had helped raise him, she lived alone, and we were also a little afraid of him getting snappy with the baby. She treated him so kindly and made a whole pee pad area for him and gave him some daily melatonin pills to calm down his anxiety (he would get shaky and pace around the room all the time and had a hard time settling down). I was a stay at home mom with my two kids and my mother worked full time, so she’d often remind me to go take him outside a few times a day. Of course I did this frequently, but there were a few days when I was so caught up with the kids that I forgot, and I would feel so guilty when I realized I forgot and the poor thing had to just pee on his pads. And even when I did go over I always had to rush because I couldn’t leave my kids alone for too long. (Which I always felt guilty about too). Whenever I had the time I would occasionally go to her apartment at night after the kids were in bed and sit with him and tell him how much I love him and try to give him some attention and love (and of course my mom did every night as well). 

2020/2021 was rough (as it was for everyone I’m sure). During my third pregnancy, my uncle (who was like a father to me) unexpectedly died in his sleep, and it shook my whole world. Then a few weeks later I had my baby. For months I had severe postpartum anxiety/depression, while also dealing with the pandemic madness and constantly fighting with my husband (who was a Covid-non believer) it was just a horrible year and a half full of anxiety and uncertainty. 

My dog was getting really old, we think he had dementia and loss of hearing/vision as well. He also had a heart condition that was slowing him down. It broke my heart every time I saw him. One day he was outside on our gated in porch. We would frequently let him walk around out there (once spring hit) to get some fresh air and sun. Unbeknownst to us, one section of the gate on the porch near the stairs wasn’t locked in properly. He somehow must have bumped into that gate or been leaning against it because it broke and he fell down the stairs 😢 I ran out holding him and instantly recognized his back legs weren’t moving 😞 My husband and I rushed him over to our local vet, where she informed us that although he wasn’t in any pain, his back legs were paralyzed, and that he would probably pass soon. We decided to put him down after her suggestion, and he peacefully passed after a strong sedative. I had been holding his paw and crying and telling him how much I loved him and all that he had done for me my whole life, but when the vet told me she was about to give him the dose that would make him pass on, I couldn’t handle the idea of watching him die, so I said goodbye to him and had to let my husband be with him for that (my husband loved him dearly as well) and I walked in the other room. I regret that with all of my heart now. I feel like I should have been there for him in his final moments (even though my husband was). I bawled my eyes out for a day or two and then, oddly enough, I felt almost numb about it and my brain kept forcing myself not to think about him passing. 

It’s taken until literally just a month ago for me to get through my worst year yet of crushing anxiety, panic attacks, and depression (due to many life factors these past couple years). I’ve recently felt a “fog” clear and I’ve been feeling like I’m back to my normal self again and haven’t been getting any panic attacks. And while that’s wonderful, I’ve recently started noticing that I’m being hit with WAVES of emotion/grief/guilt about my dear old dog. I can’t stop crying every time I think about him. I keep having these flashbacks to when he was a puppy, all the fun things we did over the years, then all the times when life got in the way of my connection with him in his older years, and then when he passed away. I have so much guilt, it’s almost like instead of remembering the millions of great times we had with him, my brain is just creating this montage video of any little time that I wasn’t kind to him. Every time I even see a dog or a dog video pops up on my phone, I start crying and think of him. 

I guess I just wanted a place to share my story and look for some peace or comfort if anybody else has had similar emotions. I know my dear pup is resting in the sweetest of peace with all the tennis balls he could dream of, I just hope that he can forgive me for some of the things I mentioned and that he knows how much I love him. 💔🙏🏻",8,23,23,0.93,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='t784ib')>,,/r/Petloss/comments/t784ib/delayed_griefextreme_guilt_feeling_heartbroken/,False

1303,yes,Divorce,2022-01-29 20:48:57,Trashtvslit,Considering divorcing my conspiracy theorist husband. Constantly feeling torn and question myself.,"Just feeling lost and would love support. Don’t know what to do about my husband. Feeling so torn.

I’m 28 and my husband is 39. We’ve been together 7 years and have 2 boys together (2 and 4). He is a very laid back, funny, loving person, and he is a great dad who loves his sons dearly. I love my husband very much, but the past 2-3 years have been hell at times, and I don’t know what to do. 

He has always been prone to slight anxiety, seasonal (winter) depression, and would sometimes go through “phases” of obsessing over things. For example, for a while he was obsessed with water filtration systems because he watched too many YouTube videos telling him that our tap water could cause cancer. Then he was obsessed with UV lights that he bought online because he claimed they help with all sorts of problems (muscle problems, vitamins, preventing cancer, etc.). I would gently point out to him that he has a habit of going through phases like this, and sometimes he would agree, but it never worried me. It was more just a minor annoyance. 

A few years ago, I started noticing he was on his phone a lot more often than usual, and it was always YouTube videos, but I didn’t question it much. He started talking to his family and friends a lot about random topics like: bigfoot, aliens, chemtrails, the moon landing being fake, the pyramids, etc. I would get annoyed by it but once again, it wasn’t a huge deal yet. 

Then shit completely hit the fan shortly after Trump became president. He went from being a person that NEVER cared about politics, to being this far right sided political “buff” who obsessively watched Trump rally videos every single night on the couch, and agreed with every single thing Trump said. He was sending meme after meme of political garbage, Trump jokes, Biden hating trolls, transphobic and sexist memes, etc. all day every day to almost all of his friends and family. Whenever id try bringing up the fact that I didn’t like that, and I didn’t plan on raising our sons with that mentality, his response was always “It’s a joke. It’s supposed to be funny. You don’t have to make such a big deal out of it.” It was like the person I had known for the previous 6 years was all of a sudden changing before my eyes. He even started voicing frustration about his friends not answering him all the time. I told him it’s because he’s acting obsessive and he’s going to drive his friends away, but he just scoffed at that and used it as reasoning for saying theyre just bad friends and that he doesn’t need them in his life anymore. 

Then covid/quarantine hit and everything went to shit even more. Im a SAHM and was home all day every day with two toddlers, trying to keep everyone healthy and keep myself sane. And all he did was go on his phone all day every day (at work too) and preach to anyone that would listen to him that covid isn’t dangerous “it’s just the flu or a cold”, refusing to wear a mask, Biden/the liberals rigged the election, Trumps going to be president again soon, the vaccine is going to kill or harm everyone, all these celebrities are part of a sex ring and they should be stopped, the list goes on. Every night he would just watch videos on his phone until he fell asleep on the couch, and never slept in bed with me anymore. (He claimed it’s because our mattress hurt his back too much…and when asked why we don’t just get a new mattress he said we can’t afford it right now…) 

Over the summer I got my first dose of the vaccine (after my entire family got it and kept asking if I would get it for my safety) and when I told him he blew up. He started ranting, yelling, swearing and spewing all his “facts” about how many people it’s killed, and how he can’t believe I got it and that I “could be putting him and our kids in jeopardy” and that he doesn’t know if he can ever have sex with me again….I just told him he needed to calm down, that it was my body and my choice, and to stop saying hurtful things, but he kept going anyways. I said “So if you wouldn’t have sex with me, and you’re THIS upset, would you even want to be with me if I get the second dose?” He goes “I don’t know.” I go “You don’t know?? How could you say that?…Look, if you’re serious about this, I’m getting really concerned for you. And I think I’m going to tell one of your brothers or your parents…” He goes “Go ahead!” So I did, and they all (luckily) were on my side and tried telling him how ridiculous he’s being. I made him stay at a friends for the weekend and told him I need space to think about things. When he came home he was very apologetic and crying and I saw a glimmer of who I used to know, and he convinced me to let him come home. I told him we shouldn’t stay together unless he would go to therapy with me (I’ve been going to therapy for 15 years for myself, but I know we needed couples therapy as well) and he said he would never go to therapy but that he would be better and wouldn’t go on his phone as much and he would sleep in bed with me again. For about a week he did those things…then went right back to his old ways soon after. 

I’ve been prone to anxiety my whole life, but it was never affecting my life day to day. This past summer I was having almost daily panic attacks. His beliefs about the vaccine harming me got to my head and gave me MAJOR health anxiety. I went to over 10 doctors appointments and multiple tests and scans, all to determine that I’m perfectly healthy but suffering a lot of stress that’s causing my symptoms. When I tried to have a conversation with him a couple months ago about how much it hurt me all summer that he caused my anxiety, his response was something like “Well I’m really sorry that I upset you and I’m sorry you’ve been having anxiety. I obviously didn’t mean to do that. But I only said all those things about the vaccine because I was extremely scared for you and I care about you and didn’t want you to get it…” which to me was like a backhanded apology. Almost like saying “Sorry I took 5 years off your life, but it was for your own good and because I love you.” 

Fast forward to present day, things have slightly “calmed down” a little: the election is over, covid is still around but becoming “old news”, and his obsessions have slightly calmed down. He is still always a great dad who loves his children dearly. He also solely supports us financially. I can tell he still has love for me, but I just don’t feel a spark or connection with him at all ever since this all started. I don’t feel “safe” with him anymore (as in, I can’t talk to him about a lot of my worries, because he’ll blame them on the vaccine or my family “manipulating me”) , I don’t feel like I did years ago, I don’t trust him when it comes to our health or our children’s health (he’s anti-vax, but I’m not, so they’re vaccinated with all of their regular vaccines) and we have zero sex life or passion (if we do it it’s because I don’t want him to start complaining he never gets any). He still brings up conspiracy fueled thoughts all the time: there’s always a celebrity in a movie we watch that he has a problem with, every time I get our children vaccinated we have a huge fight about it, he lives on his phone a lot, he never sleeps in bed with me, etc. 

One time I made us a couples therapy appointment and told him about the date coming up (hoping he would change his mind). When it came time for our zoom call with the therapist, he refused to join me and I did it alone. When I’ve told him in the past “Do you really want to keep having these same arguments/conversations over and over?…If you refuse couples therapy and never want to try to work on any of this with me then idk if we can make it…” his response is always “So youre just putting an ultimatum on me? That’s controlling. There are other ways we can fix things.” And I go “Like what?” He goes “I don’t know yet.”  🤦🏻‍♀️

1305,yes,QAnonCasualties,2022-01-25 20:50:39,Trashtvslit,My Q husband and my health anxiety are making me terrified of getting my second covid vaccine. Need help.,"EDIT: I just wanted to say that this is only the second post I’ve made (both in this group) and both times I only expected a response or two, and instead received overwhelmingly positive and helpful support. Thank you all for your continued support 🙏🏻❤️ (Also I made an appointment to get my second dose on Thursday. I just hope I don’t chicken out, because I made an appointment a few weeks ago and ended up canceling it because of my anxious thoughts and fears.) 


So long story short, I have pretty bad health anxiety. I constantly have to fight thoughts that I have a disease or that something is wrong with me. And I question every little thing that goes into my body (most times I won’t even take prescribed medicines from my doctor if I don’t absolutely have to, because I’m afraid it will somehow not agree with my system and hurt me). 

I had a lot of anxiety about getting the first dose of the Covid shot. I hadn’t had a vaccine in like 15 years since I was a kid. But I knew that covid was dangerous enough to warrant getting it, and my entire family was telling me to get it. So I finally did back in July. 

My husband on the other hand…we’ve had a lot of issues because he’s turned into a right sided, Q-led, conspiracy theorist, who believes covid isn’t dangerous and that the vaccine is a way for the government to either control us or kill us 🤦🏻‍♀️ (Here’s the whole story if you want to read) https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/s9jyj6/just_feeling_lost_and_would_love_support_dont/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

When I decided to get the first dose of Pfizer he flipped out and started quoting all of these “facts” about how dangerous it is and how many people have died from it and how it can give you a stroke, heart attack, aneurysm, etc. Because I’m already prone to anxiety, after I got the vaccine, I suffered for months of debilitating panic attacks because every ache or pain I felt, I thought it was the vaccine that was about to kill me or give me some sort of horrible complication. I hate to admit but he got into my head. I had so many heart palpitations, headaches, pains in my head, etc. that I kept thinking was the vaccine (but my family was trying to tell me it was all stress related from my husband). 

To this day I still haven’t gotten the second dose because I’m terrified that after the second dose I’m going to get all of those symptoms and panic attacks again (I’m finally starting to feel back to myself and haven’t been getting panic attacks lately, after months of hard mental work on myself). Every day I’m constantly torn between the fear of getting covid without being fully vaccinated, and the fear of getting vaccinated and causing all sorts of issues. It’s so stressful and taking a huge toll on me.",237,295,295,0.96,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='scnl7n')>,,/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/scnl7n/my_q_husband_and_my_health_anxiety_are_making_me/,False
1306,yes,QAnonCasualties,2022-01-21 20:22:35,Trashtvslit,Just feeling lost and would love support. Don’t know what to do about my husband. Feeling so torn.,"I’m 27 and my husband is 38. We’ve been together 8 years and have 2 boys together (2 and 4). He is a very laid back, funny, loving person, and he is a great dad who loves his sons dearly. I love my husband very much, but the past 2-3 years have been hell at times, and I don’t know what to do. 

He has always been prone to slight anxiety, seasonal (winter) depression, and would sometimes go through “phases” of obsessing over things. For example, for a while he was obsessed with water filtration systems because he watched too many YouTube videos telling him that our tap water could cause cancer. Then he was obsessed with UV lights that he bought online because he claimed they help with all sorts of problems (muscle problems, vitamins, preventing cancer, etc.). I would gently point out to him that he has a habit of going through phases like this, and sometimes he would agree, but it never worried me. It was more just a minor annoyance. 

A few years ago, I started noticing he was on his phone a lot more often than usual, and it was always YouTube videos, but I didn’t question it much. He started talking to his family and friends a lot about random topics like: bigfoot, aliens, chemtrails, the moon landing being fake, the pyramids, etc. I would get annoyed by it but once again, it wasn’t a huge deal yet. 

Then shit completely hit the fan shortly after Trump became president. He went from being a person that NEVER cared about politics, to being this far right sided political “buff” who obsessively watched Trump rally videos every single night on the couch, and agreed with every single thing Trump said. He was sending meme after meme of political garbage, Trump jokes, Biden hating trolls, transphobic and sexist memes, etc. all day every day to almost all of his friends and family. Whenever id try bringing up the fact that I didn’t like that, and I didn’t plan on raising our sons with that mentality, his response was always “It’s a joke. It’s supposed to be funny. You don’t have to make such a big deal out of it.” It was like the person I had known for the previous 6 years was all of a sudden changing before my eyes. He even started voicing frustration about his friends not answering him all the time. I told him it’s because he’s acting obsessive and he’s going to drive his friends away, but he just scoffed at that and used it as reasoning for saying theyre just bad friends and that he doesn’t need them in his life anymore. 

Then covid/quarantine hit and everything went to shit even more. Im a SAHM and was home all day every day with two toddlers, trying to keep everyone healthy and keep myself sane. And all he did was go on his phone all day every day (at work too) and preach to anyone that would listen to him that covid isn’t dangerous “it’s just the flu or a cold”, refusing to wear a mask, Biden/the liberals rigged the election, Trumps going to be president again soon, the vaccine is going to kill or harm everyone, all these celebrities are part of a sex ring and they should be stopped, the list goes on. Every night he would just watch videos on his phone until he fell asleep on the couch, and never slept in bed with me anymore. (He claimed it’s because our mattress hurt his back too much…and when asked why we don’t just get a new mattress he said we can’t afford it right now…) 

Over the summer I got my first dose of the vaccine (after my entire family got it and kept asking if I would get it for my safety) and when I told him he blew up. He started ranting, yelling, swearing and spewing all his “facts” about how many people it’s killed, and how he can’t believe I got it and that I “could be putting him and our kids in jeopardy” and that he doesn’t know if he can ever have sex with me again….I just told him he needed to calm down, that it was my body and my choice, and to stop saying hurtful things, but he kept going anyways. I said “So if you wouldn’t have sex with me, and you’re THIS upset, would you even want to be with me if I get the second dose?” He goes “I don’t know.” I go “You don’t know?? How could you say that?…Look, if you’re serious about this, I’m getting really concerned for you. And I think I’m going to tell one of your brothers or your parents…” He goes “Go ahead!” So I did, and they all (luckily) were on my side and tried telling him how ridiculous he’s being. I made him stay at a friends for the weekend and told him I need space to think about things. When he came home he was very apologetic and crying and I saw a glimmer of who I used to know, and he convinced me to let him come home. I told him we shouldn’t stay together unless he would go to therapy with me (I’ve been going to therapy for 15 years for myself, but I know we needed couples therapy as well) and he said he would never go to therapy but that he would be better and wouldn’t go on his phone as much and he would sleep in bed with me again. For about a week he did those things…then went right back to his old ways soon after. 

I’ve been prone to anxiety my whole life, but it was never affecting my life day to day. This past summer I was having almost daily panic attacks. His beliefs about the vaccine harming me got to my head and gave me MAJOR health anxiety. I went to over 10 doctors appointments and multiple tests and scans, all to determine that I’m perfectly healthy but suffering a lot of stress that’s causing my symptoms. When I tried to have a conversation with him a couple months ago about how much it hurt me all summer that he caused my anxiety, his response was something like “Well I’m really sorry that I upset you and I’m sorry you’ve been having anxiety. I obviously didn’t mean to do that. But I only said all those things about the vaccine because I was extremely scared for you and I care about you and didn’t want you to get it…” which to me was like a backhanded apology. Almost like saying “Sorry I took 5 years off your life, but it was for your own good and because I love you.” 

Fast forward to present day, things have slightly “calmed down” a little: the election is over, covid is still around but becoming “old news”, and his obsessions have slightly calmed down. He is still always a great dad who loves his children dearly. He also solely supports us financially. I can tell he still has love for me, but I just don’t feel a spark or connection with him at all ever since this all started. I don’t feel “safe” with him anymore (as in, I can’t talk to him about a lot of my worries, because he’ll blame them on the vaccine or my family “manipulating me”) , I don’t feel like I did years ago, I don’t trust him when it comes to our health or our children’s health (he’s anti-vax, but I’m not, so they’re vaccinated with all of their regular vaccines) and we have zero sex life or passion (if we do it it’s because I don’t want him to start complaining he never gets any). He still brings up conspiracy fueled thoughts all the time: there’s always a celebrity in a movie we watch that he has a problem with, every time I get our children vaccinated we have a huge fight about it, he lives on his phone a lot, he never sleeps in bed with me, etc. 

I feel like he still loves me, and he does show me he loves me in his own way (doing chores for me, shoveling off my car, doing the grocery shopping, buying me gifts occasionally, texting me throughout the day asking how I’m doing, making me laugh). It’s like I get these “glimmers” of the REAL him sometimes, and I suddenly feel in love with him like I always had. And then my heart breaks when he slips back into this Q person the next day when he gets on a rant about something. I WANT to believe that we are going to make it and that this will all pass.

I’m also a child of divorce, and never pictured my family breaking up like that, it breaks my heart. But some days I just can’t imagine living the rest of my life like this.

Also (because a lot of you suggested it) I’ve been going to therapy myself for about 15 years. I love it and it’s done wonders for me. My husband has never been to therapy and absolutely refuses it.

When it came time for our zoom call with the therapist, he refused to join me and I did it alone. When I’ve told him in the past “Do you really want to keep having these same arguments/conversations over and over?…If you refuse couples therapy and never want to try to work on any of this with me then idk if we can make it…” his response is always “So youre just putting an ultimatum on me? That’s controlling. There are other ways we can fix things.” And I go “Like what?” He goes “I don’t know yet.”  🤦🏻‍♀️",166,690,690,0.99,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='s9jyj6')>,,/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/s9jyj6/just_feeling_lost_and_would_love_support_dont/,False

I'm disabled. It's mostly invisible but it does impair my movement and hurt a lot. I've been on crutches before because of it, and when I was, I couldn't stand it when people opened doors and stuff for me.

When I see someone on crutches or in a wheelchair approach, for instance, a closed door, what am I supposed to do? Golden rule says I should ignore them because that's what I would want in their position. But maybe I should be doing the 'nicer' thing by offering help or stepping in to help?

1315,yes,fantasywriters,2023-04-15 13:49:28,Riksor,"Feedback on these premises, please!","I'm a biology student, so evolution and zoology are two things I'm extremely passionate about. Life on earth is so extremely interesting and I want what I love about zoology/evolution to show in my writing. I've done this before with short stories and things have turned out well, but I'm struggling to translate the fusion of English and fantastical soft science into a novel-length idea.

I've come up with several different biology-inspired fantasy premises and I'm not sure what to focus on. If someone could please tell me your favorite or any other input you can provide, I'd appreciate it a ton.

(These stories all have themes, emotional conflict, characters, etc but I'm cutting those so you don't have to read too much)

1. Animal fantasy - In this world, all tetrapods are sapient. Mammals, reptiles (including birds), and amphibians can all communicate with one another and exist in a society together. They have more or less mutually agreed that only non-tetrapods, like fish and insects, can be eaten. I think it'd be extremely interesting to explore different cultures of animals and speculate on how they'd behave, what they'd believe, how they deal with their instincts, etc. I'd also want to include more objective fantasy elements--I was thinking, for example, that because rats are both extremely compassionate/social and have short lives, they would have a system similar to Catholic saints where they deify each other after death, and that these deities would be 'real' to them. There'd also be some mystery about when this takes place in earth's history and how non-human animals even gained human intelligence and communication.I'm passionate about this idea, but non-humanoid animals walking around in little civilizations, sometimes with powers, is probably not very interesting to most people, and I do care a little about marketability.
2. Contemporary fantasy - I thought it'd be cool to do a middle grade book where kids obtain the powers to transform into any members of a certain clade. For example, one could turn into any member of felidae, the cat family. I have more for this premise but I don't think it's that interesting. All members of a clade tend to have the same basic adaptations so it would be difficult to showcase interesting creatures, especially those that don't have broad clades like pangolins or colugos.
3. Contemporary Magical Girl-Inspired Fantasy - This is intended for middle grade, and is the story I've developed/written the most. On planets with sapient life, like earth, an interdimensional World Tree sprouts. This tree spawns pocket dimensions--""fruits""--based on concepts: love, war, famine; vampires, werewolves, dragons, etc. When a concept is no longer widely believed in or cared about, the fruit 'dies' and leaves behind a Seed.A magical alien cat selects three middle schoolers to be guardians against a mysterious entity ravaging worlds and their world trees known as the Blight. He gives one a Berserker Seed, one a Elemental Seed, and the other a Magician Seed. These kids must juggle their school and homelives while also fighting off the mysterious Blight. They must also avoid getting corrupted by the Blight themselves.
4. Modern day dragons - I wrote a good chunk of this years ago but gave up on it. This is also middle grade. Premise: dragons used to exist, but evolved to take human forms and still exist in the real world. The main character discovers he's a dragon. There are different species of dragons with adaptations inspired by real-life animals, and I was thinking perhaps there'd be six basic 'elements:' not water, air, fire, earth, water, but gaseous, plasma, solids, liquids: oilslick dragons and mercury, bismuth and titanium dragons, electricity and fire dragons, dragons as light as helium or as toxic and heavy as Hydrogen Flouride, etc. There would be a secret fifth element based on dark matter which would deal with gravity powers. When all five elements are combined (by killing and chopping off body parts and Frankensteining them together) an ultimate 'Pendragon' is created. The overarching goal would be to stop the creation of a pendragon by a cultist group.

I don't expect to actually get accepted for a well-established magazine like that, especially not as an undergrad with zero previous publications and little experience. I'd throw my hat in the ring regardless, but none of them are open to submissions at the moment.

On Submittable, there's a Discover tab full of tiny, new, independent literary magazines. I've been reading through them and they're very cool. It's evident a lot of them are created by impassioned people. I've prepared cover letters for these ones but I'm hesitant to click submit.

To my understanding, if I submit to these smaller publications, I lose the ability to publish the same piece anywhere else. What happens then if the publication dies, as these smaller ones often do? Do I lose the ability to publish it elsewhere even if it's no longer viewable?

Does submitting to smaller publications help someone at all? Does it look amuerterish to list your previous work as appearing in unknown publications? Or, is it a good thing to build/strengthen your portfolio?

1323,yes,worldbuilding,2023-03-22 04:39:48,Riksor,Seeking feedback on a middle grade power system idea,"I've been working on a middle grade book for a while but I keep changing the lore behind the power system because I think my previous ideas are cringe. This one might be too, but regardless I'd like feedback on the newest iteration. 





The universe is full of solar systems, which are full of planets. In planets where life exists, a world tree also grows. 





The world tree isn't an actual thing, but it's a simplified way to view the nature of reality. The more life a planet bolsters, the stronger its tree. The more ideas, emotions, concepts, etc that the life generates, the more 'fruit' sprouts from the tree.





On earth, there is a 'fruit'--which is really a sort of world or pocket dimension--for everything deemed real or important in the public consciousness. For instance, ghosts and their world are real because a massive amount of people still believe in them. Cats are worshipped more than the Greek gods nowadays, and their world--and any beings from their world--would be more powerful than Zeus. On the other hand, werewolves aren't real anymore, but they used to be. Since nobody really believes in them anymore, the concept of werewolves withered away, and so did its world/fruit. The worlds are like pocket dimensions and beings from these fruits can infiltrate the 'normal' world, but only through 'nodes,' or portals, on the earth--and vice versa.







When a fruit is destroyed, it leaves behind a seed. These seeds--called stones--are distillations of the world/concept they came from. Those in possession of a stone gain abilities based on the concept. Someone who has the magician stone, for instance, might be able to perform illusion magic, or someone with a werewolf stone could shapeshift. The existence of these seeds means that the worlds/concepts that have withered away can be restored. If someone was using the werewolf seed and the public saw it, werewolves could once again flourish in the public mind and the world could be resurrected.






There also exists a strange viral force in the universe called blight that infects world trees. When a 'fruit' is destroyed by the blight, it is corrupted entirely and cannot ever be restored. The blight consists of dead ideas, dead people, and half-infected owners of stones. The blight is mysterious, but turns people and ideas violent. It seems to eradicate earth and the world tree.






I'd appreciate any feedback or ideas. Thank you!",3,6,6,0.81,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='11y754w')>,,/r/worldbuilding/comments/11y754w/seeking_feedback_on_a_middle_grade_power_system/,False

Don't get me wrong, I adore the concept of fantasy races. I wouldn't like DnD, Elder Scrolls, etc nearly as much if their worlds were solely populated by humans. 









As you likely know, the idea of fantasy races is that some are naturally more stealthy, cunning, lucky, etc than others, and often have diverse cultures or biologies that have them behaving in different ways. It's a fun contrast, for instance, to have an argonian talk about their hatching-day and first trip away from the Hist in a conversation at a tavern full of humans.








 I want to include fantasy races in my work, but I'm not sure how to do so in a way that is both entertaining, and not harmful. Some might say something like, ""obviously big green orcs and talking cat-men don't exist in real life, so this is a non-issue."" I'd like to believe this is the case, but it stills feels wrong to present some beings with inherent facets of their personalities or abilities dictated by their race. For instance, I think it's really great that DnD is removing the 'inherent evilness' of certain races. At the same time, it's boring to strip fantasy races of everything unique about them, and describing them in terms of stereotypes may also be a non-solution.







My ideas are:








1. Not use the term race at all, and not allow 'halfbreeds' like half-elves or half-orcs (perhaps outside of actual biological hybrid animals). The point is to very explicitly separate humans from other humanoid creatures, and describe them as totally separate species rather than races. 









2. Describe races as tendencies instead of rules. ""Dwarves tend to be crafty and dexterous,"" but they're not always. 








3. Describe racial features purely by biology and culture. ""Aarakocra, being a winged race, typically have societies in the mountains or other places of high elevation. Their cultures place a large emphasis on the joys of solitude, being geographically separated from other races. Most aarakocra are self-proclaimed loners and take pride in their independence."" 








4. Get rid of race 'bonuses' in terms of intelligence, dexterity, strength, etc, and simply define them aesthetically or culturally.







5. Give each race a defining trait (eg aarakocra have wings, humans are highly adaptable, elves have long lifespans) but with no other expectations of culture, ability, etc outside of what forms from these biological differences.








How do you all manage the ethics of fantasy races in your works?

That being said, there are some things I wish were different about the game:

\-The biology/evolution concepts. This game is clearly made by astronomy/physics enthusiasts, and the concepts are executed **extremely** well. But as a biology enthusiast I was disappointed with how 'Earth-like' the alien lifeforms were. The trees, cacti, jellyfish, normal fish--all these are just things from our world.  The anglerfish are based heavily on real-life animals, along with the Nomai, Owlks, and Hearthians. It would've been so cool to have more unique lifeforms! It would've been even cooler to have actual ecosystems! The jellyfish and anglerfish populations really make no sense from a biology perspective, and neither do the cacti. Giant's Deep could've been so interesting and full of life since it's protected from ghost matter, but all that exist there are oversized electrovorous(?) jellyfish. Even just changing the trees to be a different color than green (as the green color is what's most efficient for earth's light levels, not necessarily for other planets) could've made the game feel more interesting to me.

\-The alien cultures felt much too 'earth.' Hearthian society looks exactly like the Midwest, which could've been fine if they're analogous to humans. But the Stranger's inhabitants, too, just look like they're from a Western earth society. The beds on the Stranger are unique and interesting, for instance, but I wish there were more stuff like that. Instead, the aliens in this game have things extremely similar to us: dressing screens, picture frames, chairs like ours, dishware like ours, tables like ours, etc. The way the Nomai 'talk' is, again, just too familiar in my opinion. I would've liked it if the translations were more imperfect or foreign to the reader.

\-The jellyfish puzzle felt really strange. I had all the clues, but couldn't put them together. I know you can climb inside the jellyfish, but they're depicted in-game to have electricity around their tentacles (and their tentacles are often lethal IRL of course). I tried to kill the jellyfish, to climb inside with the ship, etc before realizing you just simply go inside.

\-The NPC dialogue. The NPCs are overall well-done but I wish there were more dialogue options that update with your gained knowledge. I always felt rushed by the time-loop so I didn't interact much with Chert and Riebeck regardless. The NPCs play such a pivotal role in the ending and theme of the game that anything to improve player attachment to them would've been really welcomed.

\-The DLC was amazing storywise, but felt a little frustrating to me when the dream world was involved. Granted, I played it before the nerf. I'm sad it didn't utilize the spaceship, but there isn't much that can be done about that.

Anyways, that's all my criticism/nitpicks/things-that-could've-been-done-better. 

Also I know there's not going to be an Outer Wilds 2 or additional DLC, but how cool would it be to have a spooky puzzle game that takes place entirely within Dark Bramble, exploring its nodes and locations? :)",233,144,144,0.96,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='w4pzsx')>,,/r/outerwilds/comments/w4pzsx/what_dont_you_like_about_outer_wilds/,False

My family adopted a little kitten when he was 7 weeks (he is a rescue, we're told his mom died) and things have been going great. He came to us with fleas and an infected eye but he's all better now, eats well, is super energetic, etc. He's 11 or 12 weeks now. 

We got him a blue breakaway collar for kittens from Walmart. It has a bell so we can keep track of where he goes. We tested it, it breaks away just fine. He's had no issues with it until today.

Today, I noticed him acting super strangely--jumping around frantically, pawing at his collar. I ran over and he was making weird noises/gurgles. I looked and the collar seemed super tight against his fur. Immediately I 'broke away' the collar and he was acting fine after that, and just wanted to have the collar back so he could play with the bell and nametag. 

My mom (the true cat owner, I just live at home during summer) wants to put the collar back on, but I'm terrified he'll choke himself again when I'm not around to help him and I'm not letting her until I get some advice.

The name tag attached to the collar is custom-made by my brother and pretty large and reflective, so maybe he was trying to play with that and choked himself. Or maybe the issue was the bell, but the bell is pretty tight against the collar band. 

Is he too young to have a breakaway collar? Is it safe to use one? Is this a fluke or serious issue? Should I remove the nametag if I continue collar use?

I keep his collar loose enough to fit two fingers beneath it. Maybe that's too tight/loose?

In USAmerica, this is very looked down upon and we have charities and activism groups just to stop this practice in other countries. 








Would I ever eat a dog? No. Do we have a right to tell other cultures that they're immoral for it? No, especially because we have factory farming practices in this nation that torture other animals on a super large scale. Pigs are smarter than dogs and we do far worse to them. Cows are sacred to some cultures and we'd be offended if one of those cultures came over and tried to get us to stop farming cows for it being immoral. Our egg industry in the US literally shreds baby male chicks alive, but other cultures are going too far for eating dogs? 








""Dogs weren't domesticated for food,"" well in the US we also raise lions, alligators, etc for food on smaller scales. We could focus on stopping that in our nation before flying to another country to stop their practices.

1379,yes,writing,2022-07-13 03:11:31,Riksor,"When you have multiple drafts, how do you choose what to focus on?","I have four novels in the works. Two are middle grade: a Watership Down/Warriors-style animal fantasy political story about dinosaur civilizations coping with natural inequalities and the oncoming meteor at the end of the Cretaceous, and an existential slightly-power-fantasy-y 'magical girl' book about a group of girls and boys suddenly given powers with the task to protect earth as the remaining beacon of extant life in the universe. The other two are YA: a post-'zombie' Apocalypse book about dehumanization, recovery, and coping with change told with an abusive antagonist lead, and a Celtic mythology fantasy adventure about a medieval peasant trying to rescue her dad from the underworld, with a lesbian romance subplot and commentary on nihilism and the purpose of living. 

I use 'in the works' lightly because they're only partially written. I keep bouncing between them. Even though they're outlined and I have thousands of words written and some chapters workshopped/reviewed, none of them are even yet half-way complete.

Every time I try to write, I get discouraged with one idea and swap to the next. I get so worried that I'm wasting time on a bad idea nobody else will like. And I hate jumping around because I feel like it takes me out of my flow and that I'd like to finish at least one work, just as practice.

1380,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-05-24 15:34:59,idkijustlovemydog,I'm so sick of my supposed friends. I bought tickets to a concert for three of us in advance. No one even mentioned paying me back until I brought it up. And still haven't been paid back. Plus so much more in post,"There was a concert that was gonna sell out fast (my friends love the artist and so do i). I tell my friends about the concert and we're all excited. We hang out and they agree to pay me back so I buy 3 tickets while we're hanging out. Total, they were $300. 

When it comes close to concert time, I arrive to my friend's house on time. I checked a million times and the concert started at 7. My other friend doesn't even arrive until 8:30.

We finally get to the concert at 9:00 and it's over by the time we get there. My friends really didn't care at all. Because they had no intention at all of ever paying me back for those tickets...

The money itself isn't what bothers me, it's the principle. I shouldn't have to remind someone to pay me back for a $100 ticket. I reminded them a few times, but I shouldn't have to beg to be paid back. Let alone 2 fucking people. These two people are always acting entitled to my belongings. Whether it be money, my time, food, rides, mental space, literally anything. And I'm so fucking sick of being disrespected.

The thing is tho.....it feels like everyone eventually starts to treat me like this. If I want friends, it seems like I have to settle for people that will be ""the least"" rude to me if that makes sense. I am so sick of it. I don't want to become bitter but it's hard. 

Sorry for the vent, I just really needed somewhere to post this. The way I'm feeling right now, I never want to see these people ever again. But I know I will....

I'm terrible at talking to people, but I'm wondering what some of you would say to these ""friends"" if this happened to you. I need some help formulating what I should say to them. 

 I only ever really reminded them twice to pay me back but I feel that's enough. I shouldn't have to call out everything they do to earn respect. They know damn well what they're doing and they're just taking advantage of me and don't care.

I have an awful bossy coworker and I heard a customer ask if we had any more of a certain product in the back. This awful coworker replies, ""I don't have any more in stock""

I know it's a very simple statement but it reveals a LOT. Any coworker I've had say this kind of comment (vs. Just saying 'we') has been fucking awful. They think they own the store and their coworkers. They are usually suck-ups to bosses and will rat you out for anything. And most importantly, people like this are incredibly difficult to work with. They're always on a power trip.

I have another example. My GM called the cops on a guy panhandling outside the store. When he was describing it to me, he said ""I don't want him doing that outside MY store"". Bro. It's not your store, it belongs to a corporation. You are just as replaceable as I am... if anything, its OUR or THE store....not ""MINE""....and you guessed it, he fucking sucks. 

Hopefully I'm describing this well. Have you worked with someone that uses ""I"" statements like I described? If so, how was that coworker?

I have worked here for 8 months and it's been the worst job I've ever had (and stayed at). The managers are the rudest I've ever come across. They cut hours. Purposely don't give you two days off in a row as punishment. Favoritism. Soooo much more

I've hated this place since the first day I started. My issue is....I literally am unable to look for new jobs. Idk what is wrong with me but this place has sucked all of my energy and I can't bring myself to look/apply.

I've tried looking for new jobs. And I just can never do it. So I was thinking....I need to fucking quit my current job with nothing lined up after. If I quit, it'll light a fire under my ass to get a new job and I'll actually follow through

I'm realizing that I'm stagnating my life. And part of that is because of this job. How long am I going to delay the next chapter of my life? I feel like I just need to quit now so I can finally move on!

My main concern is that once I quit, I won't be able to find a better job. What if I don't get motivated to apply after quitting. What am I going tell my next employer about why I quit this current job?

Idk. I know quitting without anything lined up for after is bad but I feel like I need to just finally quit so I can move on with my life.

Has anyone ever been in a similar place? Anything that helped you to apply to jobs while currently working at an awful one? I need encouragement to quit!

Anyone else had an experience like this on MDMA? Story inside,"So I was thinking about this experience today and I want to share it. 

I am now 31 but when I was in 11th grade, one of my best friends ended their life (we'll call her J)

A few weeks after J died, one of my friends and I took MDMA together.

One of J's favorite artists was owl city. This was before he got popular/ sold out when his music was actually good. I know people talk shit about owl city and for good reason..... but listen to his early music 

Anyways, I was listening to a song by owl city and began singing along. As I sang along, I could literally feel J's presence. Not only was my own voice coming out my mouth, but J's voice was coming out of my mouth as well. She was singing along to the song with me but her voice was coming out of me if that makes sense. I could feel her soul/energy/voice inside of me as I sang along and it was beautiful 

I spent the rest of the night listening to her favorite music/singing along and it was really therapeutic. this was by far the most spiritual experience I've ever had on a substance.

So yeah lol that's my story. I wish I could remember more but it was a really long time ago. Has anyone ever had an experience like this with music on mdma? I think listening to nostalgic music on mdma can lead to very spiritual experiences. Memories are linked to music and MDMA can really bring those memories to the next level

Edit: the song is ""Rainbow Veins"" by Owl City ❤

She isn't straight up micromanaging me yet but I can tell she wants to. I had some price tags on my shirt that I pulled today and she said, ""Do yOu ThInK ThAts a good PlacE tO put ThOsE?"". I just said, ""yeah! I'm for sale!"" And walked away.  

Like bruh. Who fucking cares that I have tags on my sweatshirt,  not even our actual manager cares. And it's outside her pay grade to care. It annoyed me. 

Another instance is she criticized one of our coworkers, x. She said, ""how do feel about x? I feel like they're a slow worker and complain too much"". This coworker she is talking about works in a ""subdepartment"" of our department so his work ethic literally doesn't matter to us. Also she would have to be literally watching him all day to see fast/slow he works. Again, why does she care? His work literally doesn't affect us, just like how having a tag on my sweatshirt doesn't affect her at all. 

Idk. She's annoying the fuck out of me. She takes this stupid underpaying grocery job way too seriously. I can't stand people like her, boot licking kool aid drinkers. Just do what's asked of you and go home.

Anyways.  What's an emotionally intelligent respectful way I can deal with this?",26,26,26,0.88,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='10yagja')>,,/r/antiwork/comments/10yagja/how_do_i_deal_with_a_coworker_not_boss_or_manager/,False
1400,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-01-12 05:41:05,idkijustlovemydog,"I am so sick of becoming the patsy in every social setting I'm in. Friends, work, etc. It. Always. Happens. Even in neurodivergent friendgroups","I am ""nice"" to a fault. I believe my kindness is genuine but at the same time, I'm a horrible communicator and self advocate. I'm literally incapable of standing up for myself and I hate it. Resentment builds in me and that is not nice. I need to learn to set boundaries so this resentment doesn't take over my life. I sometimes wonder if I'm actually a know-it-all judgemental asshole and my ""kindness"" is a coping mechanism or something. When I was young, my kindness was so genuine. But now that I'm 30 and an adult, that authenticity is going away and it breaks my heart 

I am forgetful, clumsy, goofy, ditsy,, etc. People are nice to me at first but eventually everyone treats me like a clueless idiot. Because ......I am. I'm not an idiot but I am very forgetful.  

I've made a group of friends and I'm beginning to see the patsy pattern emerge yet again. I smoke cigs/weed and always accidentally pocket people's lighters. I don't do it consciously, it's literally muscle memory or something. And people are beginning to make fun of me for it. I know it's harmless and coming from a place of good faith but I still don't love it. Yes I am difficult sometimes but I still deserve respect. For now it's just lighter jokes. But what will this evolve into. 

All of my best friendships have been one-on-one. People don't pick on me when it's just me and another person. But in a group, people talk and they feed off of each other. It's not them. It's me. Because it happens in literally every fucking situation I'm ever in. I can't stand it. 

I also think trauma has something to do with my forgetfulness, not just ND. I've read trauma can literally cause brain damage and I feel like I have brain damage from unprocessed trauma. The body keeps the score

Sorry for the all over the place shitpost. But yeah. I hate being the patsy in every group setting. I know I'm not dumb. But I do know my unhealthy coping mechanisms and the way I present myself. I wish people could accept the fact that I'm forgetful and goofy and not take advantage of it. 

I have heard so many people say to me ""literally everyone loves you"". One of my friends told me I'm ""disarming"" as one of my good qualities. At first I took it as a compliment but I feel like he means people can treat me like a doormat and I won't fire back. I'm a good person to take your anger out on. I genuinely don't want to fire back. I'm incapable of being ""mean"" and it sucks. But society turns people into sharks and idk how to deal with it. I need to learn to stand up for myself in a respectful non-passive aggressive way and idk how. 

Anyway. I sound like a gay incel reading this post again lol. Yes I need therapy asap. I guess.......anyone relate?",3,10,10,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='109rmt5')>,,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/109rmt5/i_am_so_sick_of_becoming_the_patsy_in_every/,False

1409,yes,autism,2023-05-19 16:09:04,theautisticcoach,Let's Break Down Divisions in the Autistic Community,"I know that this post will get taken in different ways by different people. I ask you to read to the end before commenting positively or negatively. How often do my autistic comrades with less support needs interact with those with more? AND vice versa? How many of you late dx folks identify with those who were dx early? How many of you autistic folks who are Levels 2 & 3 according to the DSM can relate to those who are Level 1? Do you see us as all autistic or something else?

While there may SEEM to be a huge chasm between these groups, I believe that this is due to the insistence of NT society along with the medical, educational, and psychological industries and decades of indoctrination and internalized ideas of what is or isn't autistic. We have a lot more in common with each other than we are led to believe. Of course, not all of our experiences are the same and not all of us can relate to the same things as the other.

We have vastly different experiences and understandings of ourselves and what autism is. Some of us will not be able to relate to the positivity and the ideas of autistic joy, while others of us cannot understand why people can possible think that autism is a not disability. Some have been masking their whole lives, others don't know what the concept even is. Some will get extremely angry when we speak about our struggles, and others equally angry if we speak about the positive aspects of being autistic. Some argue that those of us who work cannot understand those who don't, and vice versa. That our struggles aren't the same. Indeed, all of our struggles are NOT the same.

But somewhere in between all of these things, however, exists a common thread. A common experience of relating to the world and how it relates to us. A shared experience and angst living in the NT world. I believe that the labels that are given to us by those who aren't autistic put us into camps from a very young age or early stage of learning about our autistic selves. We internalize them. We believe them. We recognize their truth, while also seeing their flaws. If I'm not making sense to you yet, stick with me. I am not a wordsmith and I have issues communicating and getting my thoughts out in a coherent way all the time. That won't stop me, however, from trying. 

Whether the labels are about function, supports needs, masking level, ability to maintain social norms, or whatever, we recognize that we all have different ways of looking & being in the world and also can (but not necessarily) have trouble seeing the world thru another's eyes. Supports needs, functioning levels, masking levels, all can change over time. They are not static. They should not be a way to measure who we speak to and who we relate to more or less. These things can, and often do, change in either direction.

Now I'll get personal. I was dx (with Asperger’s) at 3 years old. I went thru the Special Education system and ABA for my formative years before being ""mainstreamed"". I was a ""success"" according to the educational, medical, and behavioral models of how we look at autistic people. Their goal is to make us ""less a problem"" to allistic adults as we get older. It left me with scars & trauma that I'm still dealing with 30+ years later, but OK, ""mission accomplished"". I moved to a new country and had to be re-diagnosed. While the “autism levels” did not exist when I was diagnosed as a child, the world has changed. People often think of those who were originally diagnosed with “Asperger’s Syndrome” as “Level 1 ASD” , but that isn’t necessarily the case. In my situation, it wasn’t. I was now, 30 years later, being diagnosed as “Level 2”, meaning I have significant supports needs.

Despite being a ""Level 2 Autistic"" I can live ""independently"" and therefore have ""low"" needs to an outsider, much like many who were originally diagnosed with “Asperger’s”. Sure, I can tie my shoes (poorly), remember to use the bathroom (usually), and work (sometimes). But I still have needs. I'm still legally & medically classified as ""Level 2"". Only I (and often my partner) can truly see that. 

To the outside, and even to most of you, I'm ""good"". I have meltdowns often, cannot get out of bed for days at a time, have had major periods of Autistic Burnout in my life, get hurt on an almost daily basis, almost hit by cars on a weekly basis, cannot deal with even the most basic requests, need to be reminded to eat and bathe, etc If I didn't have the supports that I & my partner have enabled for myself, I'd be on the street. Probably dead. I think of that often.

The country in which I live provides little to no support for ANY autistic people, even those with the highest needs for support. What's worse, is that to the outsider, to the random onlooker here on social media, I am a ""success"". I am a coach. To some of you, I am a faker or even a con artist, taking advantage of autistic people. The reality is is that I am neither a success or a con artist. I'm simply an autistic human in my late 30's who has been struggling and living in a NT world for a long time. I'm simply one of the ""lucky"" ones who was forced and abused into complying who can speak to others about my experiences in the hope to change them for others. I'm simply an autistic person who ""did what was asked"" of autistic people by NT society and now needs to deal with the consequences of being simultaneously rejected by NT society as an autistic person and ""not being autistic enough"" as well as by parts of the autistic community for being ""low supports needs"" and even by many in the late dx community as ""too negative"" about the deficits of being autistic. No matter what I say or do, someone will be angry. Someone will place be in another box that isn't theirs. I want us to stop building boxes.

I want all autistic people to know about the experiences of others that aren't like their own. I want hyperlexic autistic folks to speak with those who aren't verbal. I want those who go to university to speak with those who don't. I want those who live independently to understand those who live in an institution. I want those of us who are utterly disabled by being autistic to speak to us who don't think that way. I want those who experience pure autistic joy to sit and understand those on the other end. Because we DO all have a common thread. Something which unites us, which is why we all ARE autistic. I want us to TRY to not internalize what everyone tells us what we are and what we should be. THAT is why I do this work. Because I have seen ""both ends of the spectrum”. Precisely because I have friends and family who are both ""autistic superheroes"" who advocate for themselves and others who cannot even begin to know what the concept of self-advocacy is. We are all different, but we are all in the same boat too.

The more we are divided the more our rights and lives will be violated by those who wish to change us or remove us from society and the world. This isn't hyperbole, but something we all know is happening on a daily basis. That isn't to say that all allistic people want us dead or want to hurt us. Clearly not. But the system in which we live isn't supporting us and there are absolutely plenty of organizations and individuals who are ACTIVELY seeking to harm us. The majority are indifferent. Yes, I know that I will receive flack for this. I know I will be called an ableist (for different reasons), an idiot, someone who doesn't know how to communicate ""properly"", a charlatan, someone who ""doesn't get it"", privileged, and someone who hurts autistic people for profit. I'm used to it. I'm invalidated on a daily, invalidated by thousands on a monthly basis. AND SO ARE ALL OF YOU. I simply get it publicly for all to see. But we are all invalidated daily and it hurts. I want that to change and that's why I do what I do.

And yes, I am privileged. In that I am a white-passing MENA cis male holding a formal dx. I have it as good as almost anyone in the autistic community in terms of safety and privilege. I use that platform to speak up for those who don't have that same privilege. And yes, I am also victimized for being autistic. For being a non Christian in a Christian society. For speaking or walking and acting differently. Treated like a second-class citizen because I am multi-disabled. Like all things, there is nuance. The biggest nuance, to me, in terms of everything here, is that being autistic is complicated. There is no absolute. That can be hard for many of us who think in binary absolutes. I'm like that myself naturally, but I know that the world is more complicated. Humans are complicated.

Autistic people are all humans. We aren't one-size fits all and we all have different, yet shared struggles. This is amplified for those of us who aren't white cis males and have other disabilities and/or impairments. Anyway, I recognize that this may seem like rambling now and someone will get angry for my lack of being clear. So I will leave it to those who want to discuss these topics, and the nuance of being autistic in different ways while sharing a common thread to reply as they see fit.

And for the various naysayers - I am formally dx as Level 2, but recognize self DX as more than legitimate due to too many reasons to be listed here. I have both lived independently AND with others for support. I have studied in university and worked in a F/T high pressure job AND been unemployed and on benefits. I have been institutionalized and hospitalized in my life AND been a mentor to those who are in institutions & hospitals. I know how to travel by myself but also need to take weeks to mentally prepare and even then, often cannot handle it. I know what it's like to have a meltdown in public and be harmed by the police for it. I know what it's like to be picked on, shamed, blamed, and harmed. I am proud and happy to be autistic but also know the great challenges and pain that come along with it. I live in the grey spaces and nuance. It's there that we can relate to each other, even if we seem differently from afar. I know what it's like to be an autistic person who has both been removed from society & as one who has built an independent life. I see both ends and have lived it.

1411,yes,AutismTranslated,2023-05-19 09:55:44,theautisticcoach,Divisions in the Autistic Community,"I know that this post will get taken in different ways by different people. I ask you to read to the end before commenting positively or negatively. How often do my autistic comrades with less support needs interact with those with more? AND vice versa? How many of you late dx folks identify with those who were dx early? How many of you autistic folks who are Levels 2 & 3 according to the DSM can relate to those who are Level 1? Do you see us as all autistic or something else?

While there may SEEM to be a huge chasm between these groups, I believe that this is due to the insistence of NT society along with the medical, educational, and psychological industries and decades of indoctrination and internalized ideas of what is or isn't autistic. We have a lot more in common with each other than we are led to believe. Of course, not all of our experiences are the same and not all of us can relate to the same things as the other.

We have vastly different experiences and understandings of ourselves and what autism is. Some of us will not be able to relate to the positivity and the ideas of autistic joy, while others of us cannot understand why people can possible think that autism is a not disability. Some have been masking their whole lives, others don't know what the concept even is. Some will get extremely angry when we speak about our struggles, and others equally angry if we speak about the positive aspects of being autistic. Some argue that those of us who work cannot understand those who don't, and vice versa. That our struggles aren't the same. Indeed, all of our struggles are NOT the same.

But somewhere in between all of these things, however, exists a common thread. A common experience of relating to the world and how it relates to us. A shared experience and angst living in the NT world. I believe that the labels that are given to us by those who aren't autistic put us into camps from a very young age or early stage of learning about our autistic selves. We internalize them. We believe them. We recognize their truth, while also seeing their flaws. If I'm not making sense to you yet, stick with me. I am not a wordsmith and I have issues communicating and getting my thoughts out in a coherent way all the time. That won't stop me, however, from trying. 

Whether the labels are about function, supports needs, masking level, ability to maintain social norms, or whatever, we recognize that we all have different ways of looking & being in the world and also can (but not necessarily) have trouble seeing the world thru another's eyes. Supports needs, functioning levels, masking levels, all can change over time. They are not static. They should not be a way to measure who we speak to and who we relate to more or less. These things can, and often do, change in either direction.

Now I'll get personal. I was dx (with Asperger’s) at 3 years old. I went thru the Special Education system and ABA for my formative years before being ""mainstreamed"". I was a ""success"" according to the educational, medical, and behavioral models of how we look at autistic people. Their goal is to make us ""less a problem"" to allistic adults as we get older. It left me with scars & trauma that I'm still dealing with 30+ years later, but OK, ""mission accomplished"". I moved to a new country and had to be re-diagnosed. While the “autism levels” did not exist when I was diagnosed as a child, the world has changed. People often think of those who were originally diagnosed with “Asperger’s Syndrome” as “Level 1 ASD” , but that isn’t necessarily the case. In my situation, it wasn’t. I was now, 30 years later, being diagnosed as “Level 2”, meaning I have significant supports needs.

Despite being a ""Level 2 Autistic"" I can live ""independently"" and therefore have ""low"" needs to an outsider, much like many who were originally diagnosed with “Asperger’s”. Sure, I can tie my shoes (poorly), remember to use the bathroom (usually), and work (sometimes). But I still have needs. I'm still legally & medically classified as ""Level 2"". Only I (and often my partner) can truly see that. 

To the outside, and even to most of you, I'm ""good"". I have meltdowns often, cannot get out of bed for days at a time, have had major periods of Autistic Burnout in my life, get hurt on an almost daily basis, almost hit by cars on a weekly basis, cannot deal with even the most basic requests, need to be reminded to eat and bathe, etc If I didn't have the supports that I & my partner have enabled for myself, I'd be on the street. Probably dead. I think of that often.

The country in which I live provides little to no support for ANY autistic people, even those with the highest needs for support. What's worse, is that to the outsider, to the random onlooker here on social media, I am a ""success"". I am a coach. To some of you, I am a faker or even a con artist, taking advantage of autistic people. The reality is is that I am neither a success or a con artist. I'm simply an autistic human in my late 30's who has been struggling and living in a NT world for a long time. I'm simply one of the ""lucky"" ones who was forced and abused into complying who can speak to others about my experiences in the hope to change them for others. I'm simply an autistic person who ""did what was asked"" of autistic people by NT society and now needs to deal with the consequences of being simultaneously rejected by NT society as an autistic person and ""not being autistic enough"" as well as by parts of the autistic community for being ""low supports needs"" and even by many in the late dx community as ""too negative"" about the deficits of being autistic. No matter what I say or do, someone will be angry. Someone will place be in another box that isn't theirs. I want us to stop building boxes.

I want all autistic people to know about the experiences of others that aren't like their own. I want hyperlexic autistic folks to speak with those who aren't verbal. I want those who go to university to speak with those who don't. I want those who live independently to understand those who live in an institution. I want those of us who are utterly disabled by being autistic to speak to us who don't think that way. I want those who experience pure autistic joy to sit and understand those on the other end. Because we DO all have a common thread. Something which unites us, which is why we all ARE autistic. I want us to TRY to not internalize what everyone tells us what we are and what we should be. THAT is why I do this work. Because I have seen ""both ends of the spectrum”. Precisely because I have friends and family who are both ""autistic superheroes"" who advocate for themselves and others who cannot even begin to know what the concept of self-advocacy is. We are all different, but we are all in the same boat too.

The more we are divided the more our rights and lives will be violated by those who wish to change us or remove us from society and the world. This isn't hyperbole, but something we all know is happening on a daily basis. That isn't to say that all allistic people want us dead or want to hurt us. Clearly not. But the system in which we live isn't supporting us and there are absolutely plenty of organizations and individuals who are ACTIVELY seeking to harm us. The majority are indifferent. Yes, I know that I will receive flack for this. I know I will be called an ableist (for different reasons), an idiot, someone who doesn't know how to communicate ""properly"", a charlatan, someone who ""doesn't get it"", privileged, and someone who hurts autistic people for profit. I'm used to it. I'm invalidated on a daily, invalidated by thousands on a monthly basis. AND SO ARE ALL OF YOU. I simply get it publicly for all to see. But we are all invalidated daily and it hurts. I want that to change and that's why I do what I do.

And yes, I am privileged. In that I am a white-passing MENA cis male holding a formal dx. I have it as good as almost anyone in the autistic community in terms of safety and privilege. I use that platform to speak up for those who don't have that same privilege. And yes, I am also victimized for being autistic. For being a non Christian in a Christian society. For speaking or walking and acting differently. Treated like a second-class citizen because I am multi-disabled. Like all things, there is nuance. The biggest nuance, to me, in terms of everything here, is that being autistic is complicated. There is no absolute. That can be hard for many of us who think in binary absolutes. I'm like that myself naturally, but I know that the world is more complicated. Humans are complicated.

Autistic people are all humans. We aren't one-size fits all and we all have different, yet shared struggles. This is amplified for those of us who aren't white cis males and have other disabilities and/or impairments. Anyway, I recognize that this may seem like rambling now and someone will get angry for my lack of being clear. So I will leave it to those who want to discuss these topics, and the nuance of being autistic in different ways while sharing a common thread to reply as they see fit.

And for the various naysayers - I am formally dx as Level 2, but recognize self DX as more than legitimate due to too many reasons to be listed here. I have both lived independently AND with others for support. I have studied in university and worked in a F/T high pressure job AND been unemployed and on benefits. I have been institutionalized and hospitalized in my life AND been a mentor to those who are in institutions & hospitals. I know how to travel by myself but also need to take weeks to mentally prepare and even then, often cannot handle it. I know what it's like to have a meltdown in public and be harmed by the police for it. I know what it's like to be picked on, shamed, blamed, and harmed. I am proud and happy to be autistic but also know the great challenges and pain that come along with it. I live in the grey spaces and nuance.

Using terms like this is part of our internalized ableism. That isn't to say that we cannot be manipulative or any of those things, but it is not essential to our being autistic. When these words are typically used in the community it's because we don't like someone. 

While all autistic people will not be friends, the theory of Double Empathy posits that we should at least be able to communicate on the same level. I think it goes deeper than this. It’s about understanding the POV, not that we always understand or agree with the RATIONALE. I can vehemently disagree with a fellow autistic person, but understand why they believe something, even if I don’t accept that belief. We can extend grace to our fellow autistic brains. 

That doesn’t mean that it’s OK to use slurs like I used above. These are the words of our literal oppression. These are the words that have been used to inflict trauma on us; to gaslight us for decades. If you use these terms when speaking about other autistic people, take a pause. Remember Double Empathy. Remember that their brain is similar to yours and processes things similarly, even if different on this topic. When both sides assume good faith there can be positive outcomes, even if not agreement. When we go in with bad faith, using the terms above, all shuts down. You are putting your fellow autistic person into the same traumatic place that NTs have been putting them for years. 

Your mask and want of fitting in has become so neurotypicalized that you are becoming the very thing you hate in that moment. Pause. PAUSE. Is the person you’re debating with truly “evil”? Or do they simply have a thought process that arrived somewhere else? Maybe you can walk them thru it. Calmy. Politely. Bring them to your POV. Rarely will they be TRULY evil, though of course it is possible. Be patient. Extend grace to one another.

While all NTs aren't actively seeking to oppress autistic people, many, in fact, do. When we advocate for ourselves to these individuals we will get slapped down. Insulted. Cursed at. Put down. Perhaps even violently. 

This can be discouraging. More than discouraging, it IS dysregulating. It costs us spoons. It makes us afraid to do it again. A step back. I know the feeling of having my self-advocacy turned against me by NTs. So do you. We are called ""selfish"", ""not a team player"", and even told that ""we play the victim"". 

People in authority and with privilege don't like to be questioned or pushed by who they see as their inferior. They have their own issues of feeling inadequate. That doesn't mean we have to accept it, but it's important to know that the ""failure"" of our advocacy doesn't sit with us. It isn't because we ""didn't try hard enough"". It's because NTs in power (over us or over society) don't want to yield to us.

I, of course, see why people use these labels to describe themselves and why we identify with them. All of this IS NOT to say that some of us mask more than others or that some of us need more support than others. Obviously we are all different. 

What I AM saying, is that these labels help those on the outside, people who are NOT autistic classify us, divide us, abuse us, and worse. That's all. No one is more autistic than someone else. We are all autistic and each have our own needs, stories, and strategies.

I believe that these labels of high-low can only be used to describe someone's state at any given moment, not to be used to describe subsets or types of autistic people.

We will be looking at how executive function plays a role in our wellbeing, how special interests and our values influence our health and happiness, and how to battle ableism in society and within ourselves. All groups are totally accessible to all autistic folks.

So I was driving to the grocery store with my mom in her car. She had surgery recently and was wheelchair bound so she got a temporary handicap tag.

I pulled around looking for a close parking spot, but at first I couldn't find one so I put my blinkers on and helped her into her wheelchair before I went around looking for a parking spot again. She went in and waited at the front for me so I could get the cart and help her with her shopping.

I went around to look for a spot that was relatively close when I spotted a handicap spot that had just opened up. I went ahead and pulled in, and after I locked up and started walking to go inside, a car pulled up next to me and began SCREAMING at the top of her lungs that she needed the spot because she was handicapped, and that I was fraudulently using the spot.

I'm autistic with cPTSD, and shut down the *second* someone starts to shout. So, I go back to the car, and pull out while she's yelling her head off, then park in the waaaaaaay back hoping that she would park and be in before I had a chance to meet with her again. And I figured that I'd just pull the car around when we were done and do the blinker thing again. Not a big deal, right? Wrong!

But unfortunately, by the time I got up to the store door, she was there, screaming her head off at me again. I was mortified. I walked in, still not saying anything and feeling faint bc I'm about to have a panic attack. It took me a second to find my mom with this bitch behind me, screaming 'you don't get to part in a disabled spot?! Who do you think you are?! Son of a b*h! Do you know the distress you caused me?!' I genuinely thought she was gonna try to beat me with her cane.

Of course I don't turn around to tell her I'm about to have a full on melt down bc she doesn't know the distress she's causing me because now I can't even remember that language is part of my capabilities. But regardless.

I find my mom looking at greeting cards and walk up to her as this person is still screaming at me, and take her hand to tell her I'm starting to panic. My mom is a Karen all of her own, and we do NOT have a good relationship bc of how entitled  and narcissistic she is, but this was the one time she actually defended me. And it was a short fight, where my mom rolled up to this woman and started screaming at her until she walked away.

So yeah, TD;DR parked in parking spot bc mom was handicap after I dropped her off. Got chased by handicap Karen until handicap mom chased her off.",21,10,10,0.87,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13g4b4f')>,,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13g4b4f/aita_for_parking_in_a_handicap_spot/,False

1459,yes,Paranormal,2023-05-07 06:56:51,aairo1228,Is this paranormal or am I going crazy,"Alright. First post... No pressure.

So, my wife's father recently passed away. It was sudden, and very traumatic for us all... We've been trying to clean out the house and get everything situated, but it's been hard. So truth be told, we've been neglecting it.

But, when we do come back to check the mail or to just sit and watch TV, it always feels welcoming and calm. There's a nice air about it.

So, ""paranormal"" stuff. I've believed in the paranormal for a while, have gone on investigations, etc. And I notice that about 90% of the places I've been have explanations. 

I have no explanations for this stuff.

There's classic stuff, cool air, weird emfs. But, all that could be explained with a draft and wiring. 

The weirdness is when we came over for sister in laws birthday. They were drinking (I'm so er bc lucky me was born with an allergy to most alcohols) and we decided to try our spirit box. We didn't get much on them, but, when we went upstairs, we were talking about redecorating the nursery because they were off on a drunken tangent. Then the door handle fully turned and clicked open the door.

I screamed like a tiny child, and the girls all yelled and slammed the door back shut. But, like something straight up out of the movies, it wouldn't shut. Not for a few long seconds before whatever was holding it disappeared and the girls fell onto the damn door.

We tried to recreate it right after we all laughed at being so scared over something that was probably nothing. Maybe the draft blew it open? Nope, no draft and it was latched good. It's a heavy, old door. Was there a piece of broken wood from the frame to blame for it staying open? Couldn't find anything. This house was build a hundred years ago, and it's all original (except the god awful wallpaper).

After setting up a security system, because we're out a few days at a time, we noticed what looks like orbs around. Though, it's hard to tell bc of the dust.

We stayed away for a while after that, because nothing else happened. Until tonight.

The house got broken into because it's been vacant, not that there's anything valuable in it unless you want a heavy 1970s tv. But it was still a violation of our space. We got here and have been chilling in the livingroom, watching TV on our phones and we heard a weird noise. 

The second hand on the clock on the wall, an analog clock powered by a double a battery, started spinning. Just the second hand. Then there was a shadow that we've been trying to convince ourselves was a car headlight.

And I'm wracking my brain as to what caused the second hand to freak out, when I heard the locked back door click open. It's locked by a latch lock, with the latch on my side. I went over and saw the basement light on. There's a workshop down there and a washer and dryer unit, but not much else. I go down like the white guy in a horror movie, and look around. Nothing. No where for anyone to hide. So I casually go back up, lock it, and begin writing a reddit post

1461,yes,stories,2022-12-12 08:33:56,aairo1228,To the woman at the gas station...,"I was working as a delivery driver. I stopped for some water at the gas station when I saw a girl and her boyfriend talking to each other on their bikes. It was like one am and she was crying. I didn't think much of it until I came out and they were sitting on the curb while he was holding her head.

I went over because I was trained in first aid, and thought I might be able to help. When I got there, this girl told me she got hit by a car, and hit her head really bad, but she didn't want to go to the hospital because they were homeless and were afraid they would get turned away. I had her get up and walk to see how disoriented she was, with her boyfriend holding her up by her other arm when a woman came out and started yelling at me, ""you're not taking her to your car!""

Now, I'm a pretty big dude, and I was masked (bc covid) so I get it. I explained to her what happened, and the woman said she saw it, and that she was an rn. I was super relieved that she was there because the girl was way too disoriented and her hand was broken, which she hadn't even realized until I pointed it out. 

The nurse thought it was a fracture on the bone around her temple and eye socket, but she for sure had a concussion. I took the nurse a bit away from them and told her that I'm going to call the ambulance when I get back to work. She nodded and thanked me, and then I said my good byes to the girl and her boyfriend. I don't know what happened after that, but I did see ambulances when I drove by again.

I want to say to that woman that I'm really grateful that she stepped in. Because when I was a young woman, I'm FTM, I was lured into a car and raped. I wish someone was there for me, but my boyfriend at the time didn't even believe me even after I came home from the er. He thought I cheated on him and made it up. 

So, I don't know if she'll ever see this, but Mrs. Nurse, thank you for looking out for her. You can't tell a person's past by their appearance, and even though I wasn't going to hurt her, you couldn't have known that. In essence, you saved her life.

I hope you're all doing well, and to the girl, I hope you were able to get to your mom's house like you said you were going.",3,5,5,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='zjsom6')>,,/r/stories/comments/zjsom6/to_the_woman_at_the_gas_station/,False

I'm still in school, after failing a few classes and being unable to keep up with the course work, I tried to calm the school thing down and go part time and work part time. Well, 5 jobs this year and I haven't managed to keep a hold of one for over a month. I have panic attacks that are so bad that I faint or throw up. And it's just over leaving the house. I've tried to relax, tried to find outlets with friends and I can't even manage that these days. My wife is super supportive, and kind.

I don't have insurance, and there's no counselor or therapist that's free out here that's equipped to handle someone like me, I've tried the only free resource out here.

I wanted to let everyone know I am relaunching GNDR FCKD on WebToons in a month or so, you can follow me on my facebook at  [https://www.facebook.com/wyrmsandoubliettes](https://www.facebook.com/wyrmsandoubliettes) for all of the updates and announcements concerning that. 

&#x200B;

As an FTM person myself, I really want to see more representation concerning important issues in the community. As a result, this comic will reflect some of my more personal experiences, and will be extremely mature, so when it launches there will be warnings concerning what it is dealing with.

  
I would like to know, from the FTM community, about any scenarios that you have been apart of, or any issues you have concern about, that you would like to see addressed in the comic.   
Thank you all for your support! :)

>  
\*Interoception means sensing internal signals from your body, like when you are hungry, when your heart is beating fast, or when you need the toilet.    


I am of course autistic, have ADHD and certain other issues like c-PTSD, Clinical Depression and anxiety disorder on top of that. 

I have large periods of hyperfocus and time blindness so it is not abnormal for me to sit 12 hours uninterrupted coding in my own little bubble without eating, drinking, going to the toilet or doing anything other than shift around on my chair while I work. 

When I am in those zones I can't hear my alarms or anything like that either so, my long-distance partner used to remind me daily but has been drowning in their work and just hasn't even had the chance to message me in the right time slots to check in an remind me, or persistently ring my phone and desktop messengers until it comes through that someone is trying to reach me. 

Does anyone have experience with the issues like:

* Not noticing you need to pee until you're almost wetting yourself?
* Not noticing your hungry before you start to crash from lack of nutrition?
* Not noticing you've not drank anything all day until you just realize your mouth is sandpaper?
* Not noticing you're tired until you start falling asleep where you stand?

That doesn't even account for stuff like medication...I can't rely on my partner, but they did this for me for 13 years almost and nothing I try like setting alarms has been helping.",11,10,10,0.92,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='12x3qxe')>,,/r/SpicyAutism/comments/12x3qxe/interoception_issues_and_time_blindness/,False
1479,yes,AutisticAdults,2022-11-26 10:13:46,HyperAutisticDude,The right environment makes all the difference,"Finding a job and a place to belong often seemed to feel like a lost battle to me. At home, at school and at all my previous jobs I'd be bullied, excluded and blamed for being different. 

Bad intensions such as arrogance, malice, and such prescribed to my behaviours my desire to help, share knowledge and such seen as trying to be a show off and such. 

I spend 6 - 7 years working call enter after high school and would optimize our scripts and knowledge items, which they would use because they were better but then also say I was a know it all and arrogant and passive aggressive. 

I had to break away from my family and after call centre I ended up in a job training course through our unemployment program and ended in a Java bootcamp. It was a lot of fun, and people suddenly loved my knowledge hoarding and sharing and how I worked.

It became clearer and clearer that my sensory and social issues were an issue on the work floor.  So when I was looking for a job and was asked about my weaknesses I was honest about it, I am one of the people on the spectrum who just can’t lie, so many interviews ended just because I indicated that I was Autistic and on the waitlist for the full diagnosis. I however didn’t have one yet so companies that recruited in that direction weren’t an option either.

So many doors were closed in my face on the first interview, more afterwards when they said it was no problem only for them to see my honesty as a liability. Until I got approached by my current employer, they didn’t have room for me at the time, but they could see how passionate and eager to learn I was. They kept me in mind and when they had room for me, they gave me the chance to prove I was a good fit, and I was hired. 

They told me “I don’t care about a diagnosis, tell me what you need and we’ll see what we can do.”   

I have proven myself a hard worker, and a team player. I might look weird to people with my sunglasses on all the time, wearing noise cancelling gear as I dig in on the technical riddle in front of me. I got to do this because they believed in me, and because they didn’t stumble back on my honesty and focused on my passion and what I could bring to the table. 

I do my best, and instead of hiding and laying low, all my coworkers know, I tell new hires myself because I became the tech point for the entire team. In a year and a half I went from junior to technical lead. 

We recently got a review system where we give each other feedback, and I cried when I got my yearly this week because all the feedback was about how much they loved working with me, and appreciated what I brought to the table. 

I don't get forced to come to the office, though they ask me to try and come in once a month so the coworkers can hang out with me without needing to schedule in a Teams call. When there are surprise events my boss notifies me in advance so I don't get thrown off and can prepare for them. 

It took me a year to find this job after having been told that I would have a job in no time because of how skilled I was by the school, but I am glad I was open and honest about my situation because I found an office where I am not only able to make my pay check, but where I get to feel like I belong.

1483,yes,IncelExit,2022-04-28 08:57:59,HyperAutisticDude,My journey from incel to be engaged,"I wanted to share my story, but I want to preface this with a TW, my story contains references to r\*pe and murder, nothing explicit, just it's part of it.

&#x200B;

I am an autistic man, the type that was overly honest, didn't understand personal boundaries, and never seemed to be able to form any lasting friendship with women, or a lot of people in general honestly.

I personally am not one of the people with a high sex drive, but I have a high need for intimacy and companionship. I was bitter, oh so very bitter, ""Women are all so two face, cold, and don't appreciate a nice honest guy"".

It's a sentiment I know a lot of incel's start with. I was so frustrated, and I felt like my being small (5'3), autistic, ""nice"" was just repelling women.

I had this mindset for a very long time, never fell into the punishing women for it mindset, mostly because it was before I went to look at places like forum's and reddit, since I felt the same would happen there.

I made a friend during that period though, online, through Deviantart, wasn't told their gender, didn't care really, didn't think I'd stand a chance if they turned out to be a woman anyway. So we wrote together, talked about our lives together. Since I didn't know what gender they were, I treated them like a person.

Years of this friendship passed, I learned my friend was a woman, but they were so cemented as the person and friend I had that I didn't suddenly flip a switch and start treating them differently, just saw them as an exception to the rule of how women were.

I had made a male friend in real life during that time to, during my last years of high school, a friend with a little sister, I saw her as my own little sister due to how close we all got, even fought with her like a sibling. Then in feb 2017 she met an Incel to trade figurines. She went missing and she was found in his garden, he'd lured her in with her hobby to force her to give him what he felt he was owed, for what he felt the world owed him, a ""foid"" to control and breed with. When she resisted, he'd killed her so violently he injured his own hand. (If you want proof of the case being real Pokemon Murder Antwerp Belgium)

He was my exact age, similar story, and just a slightly more extreme view than I had, and he completely destroyed my view on life. The more came to light the more I realized how close to that mind set I was, if I had been more sexually targeted...I shudder to think that I might have reasoned that it was my right to have that need met. I examined my black and white notions on people, especially women, and really looked at how I presented and acted.

During that time my DeviantArt friend was there for me, which helped, but it was hard, and it took a lot of therapy and re-evaluating myself. I realized that yes I think differently, yes I see the world differently and I don't emote naturally so I trigger the uncanny valley effect in people a lot. But I also realized I was approaching people in real life with a lot of expectation to be rejected and shunned, which turned it into a self fulfilling prophecy that furthered my frustration and what had been a growing simmering rage at how unfair it all was.

My two friends helped me, my therapist helped me, and at the end of my journey, my very first friend, my deviant art friend, became more than that, she became my amazing long distance girlfriend, who I get to call with and talk to almost daily, and soon we're moving in together after I popped the question and she said yes.

A person I spend 12 years of my life getting to know, without ever having the expectation for it to become anything more than an internet friend, a person I never put in a box.

A woman I treated as a person, who I allowed to know me, not a persona to try and fit in and get the girl so I can finally have some one to meet my needs to cuddle and be affectionate.  Neither of us is perfect, but we approached each other as people, I saw her as a person first and a woman second, I had no expectations, and that's where I found it.

I like to think I'd have come to this journey naturally with age if it had never happened, but end of the day, I might have gotten sucked into an echo chamber and gotten deeper and deeper into that black and white view that we can so easily get sucked into.

I am sharing my story, because it's a victory through a tragedy, but also, let that guy be a warning, of the path the mindset we fall in can lead to, attacking people because we want them, or mass killing people because we're mad at the world...

It's easier said then done to change that mindset, and kind of funnily what's been helping for me is just stopping to put genders on people, everyone is a they to me now until they specifically tell me otherwise, and by the time they do, my behavior has already been established.

I was diagnosed shortly after my 18th birthday while I was in an abusive relationship. They never did tests, the psychologist just told me the nurses ""kept an eye on me"" and that's how they diagnosed me with BPD. Back then I had many problems because of that abusive relationship - i often self harmed,  had an eating disorder and my abuser forced me to drink lots of alcohol so I also had a problem with that. Now that I'm single and healing from that trauma I'm not sure if that was the right thing to do to diagnose me with BPD while i was still being abused. Especially without any tests.

When Logan was in the hospital and recuperating, Marcia tried to push all the children away, including Shiv. Shiv helped to push Marcia aside by supporting Logan getting close to Rhea.

2. When Nate criticises her about brokering a deal between Logan and Gil, she reveals the truth to Tom, and Tom humiliates Nate.

3. When Rhea betrayed Shiv, Shiv made sure to influence Logan so that Rhea was picked for CEO while Waystar was in the line of fire of the DOJ.

4. When Gil criticises her, she sides with Logan. She also goes on to supports her family in witness tampering and humiliating Gil in court.

5. When Kendall plays Nirvana over her speech, she releases a reputation-shattering public letter. 

6. When Roman was getting too close to Logan, in Shiv’s opinion, she influenced Logan to think of Roman as incompetent because of the pictures he sent to Gerri.

7. Tom betrayed her in the last episode of the 3rd season and she was divorcing Tom before Logan died.

Of course, she got back together with Tom, and her mom also betrayed her, and we have yet to see what Shiv will do to her.

How will all this work with Logan gone? I don’t know, as it seems like her main strategy is to use her sway over Logan against other people.

In my opinion, it doesn’t seem like she really plans any of this but she seems to be more of an opportunist. If someone has betrayed her, then, if she sees an opportunity to hurt or undermine them, she does it.

Her actions don’t completely shut the other person down, but they do deal some kind of significant blow. However, with her feeling sidelined by her brothers, the outcome of the election, her father’s death, the state of her marriage and her planning to have a child (so she might care even more about the state of the nation and how the Roy’s are perceived by the public), she might hit a bit harder this time.

Historically, she also doesn’t seem that interested in shoring up her own position when she does any of this. She’s looking to advance her position, sure, but I feel like she sometimes “goes for the kill” in way that feels compulsive and self-destructive which is similar to Logan. She wants to hurt the person who betrayed her, ideally more than they hurt her.

I’m interested in seeing where this little subplot goes in the next two episodes.

As a kid, I thought I was the weird one. I mean, of course I am, I have autism and ADHD, but I was only recently diagnosed as an adult, and also, these conditions are, at least partially, genetic, so they probably have some of these traits too. 

When I went to school, and interacted with other kids and adults, I realised that my family is weird too. I still have moments when I share certain things with friends, strangers, colleagues etc., and they do a double take. I hate those moments, but I also like them, because it makes me feel validated in the confusion, and sometimes the pain, resulting from the behaviour of my realtives. 

Eventually, I learnt to mask, not only my own behaviours, but the behaviours of my relatives. Like all other types of masking, it’s not super effective and also exhausting.

Throughout my life, I went from thinking the problems in my family are about psychology, then thinking it was about generations of trauma related to politics and economics, and finally, now, understanding it’s also about neurodiversity. Really, its all these things and probably much more.

It’s always felt like a Rubix Cube, but far more complicated. When it comes to Rubix Cubes, there are people who work on solutions that you can read and apply. Are psychologists these people for my family problems? I don’t know. I want a playbook and I want it yesterday.

I’ve never known how to feel or what to do. It feels like there are no “correct” feelings or actions. Or, that the “correct” feelings and actions are designed for “neurotypical” standards. I don’t mean that any one individual person is truly “neurotypical” but that systems in our society are designed based on certain assumptions about neurotypes and all kinds of other things, like privileging the wealthy, and “white”, and “able-bodied”.

I closed the door on all of this several years ago, in order to focus on the things I can actually control in my life, since those are challenging to manage already, but I’m thinking about all of this again as there is a special occasion coming up and I feel compelled to engage with it in a kind of superficial “well-wishing” kind of way.

I’m quite frustrated with a lack of easily accessible empirical evidence when it comes to career-related topics. 

For example, how accurate are different career assessments and what are the basic elements of career satisfaction?

I have found this article:
https://80000hours.org/career-guide/job-satisfaction/

But it’s only one article, it’s rather old, it’s written from a privileged perspective and tied to the philosophy of effective altruism. It’s not bad but I would like more articles like this one that might provide a wider range of perspectives.

I have also looked at self-report surveys of people in certain professions. However, these feel inadequate as well. For example, not everyone will be suited to being a nurse because interacting with people all day in a high-stress environment with lots of sensory stimulation might not be the best fit for them.

In addition, a lot of the research on autism, ADHD and other neurodiversity related to employment seems rather ableist and sexist etc.

Is anyone else also frustrated by this? I feel like most of the information I find is essentially outdated jibber jabber full of assumptions and overgeneralisations. Am I just not looking in the right place?

Does anyone know of a specific organisation or professional that focuses on providing empirical evidence related to careers to the general public?

I posted this in the “career guidance” subreddit, but didn’t get any replies so maybe this is one of those “neurotypicals don’t get it” kind of questions and I’d like to ask it here, much like people often ask for “relationship advice” but aren’t actually looking at the research at all or considering what the biases are behind these studies.

1506,yes,TheTryGuys,2022-10-09 18:06:09,NoPiano6624,Everything wrong with the SNL sketch (a far too long comprehensive breakdown),"My first instinctual response to pain is intellectualising. Welcome to the inside of my brain. It’s wordy in here.

Serious issues first:

1. Not protecting possible victims: In the “what happened” video Eugene, Zach and Keith never confirmed who the employee was. This was for good reason as this employee would be subjected to harassment and public shaming. And the employee who people think it might be has, in fact, been subjected to this. We cannot ignore that this person is an Asian American woman and this brings into play the history of abuse in the USA and elsewhere towards Asian women. In the SNL skit, they refer to the employee as “one of the Food Babies”. There are two Food Babies. Both have Asian heritage. People have already been confusing one for the other, a common problem that results from systemic racism. By saying “Food Babies” they are not only directing public shame towards the suspected person who is already vulnerable because of their gender and race, but they are also directing public shame towards an innocent victim who is also vulnerable because of their gender and race. This, to me, is possibly the worst thing that is actually wrong with the skit.
2. Invalidating victims of workplace sexual harassment, especially those oppressed by gender and race: This is a case of possible workplace sexual harassment. Firstly, they mock the “power dynamics” involved and even mock saying “it’s racist”. I don’t see how this is excusable, even in comedy or something theoretical. It’s not simply about the specifics of this situation as much as it is about how cases of workplace sexual harassment are handled both in private between employer and employee and in public, between colleagues and in the media. How does anyone expect victims to come forward if this is how these cases are treated? They are mocking a victim’s descriptions of the forces in play that actively abuse them and keep them oppressed. Secondly, Ned, the boss, has claimed that it was “consensual” in his official statement and SNL repeats this narrative. However, we do not have the employee’s statement saying that this was indeed consensual. Would we have the same narrative for workplace theft as we do for workplace sexual harassment? Imagine a different scenario, imagine if your boss was driving your car for a year, and I asked them whether you agreed to have them drive your car for a year, and the boss said “yes, they consented.” I would wonder whether you felt safe to say no to your boss and importantly l would wait to hear from you whether it is actually true that you consented to this and that you are indeed happy and benefiting from this transaction, before I categorised this as consensual. We can also probably agree that it is an unusual scenario, that the boss might be abusing their power, that some professional boundaries are crossed by the boss and that you should maybe be trying to get out of this job to find something more healthy.
3. Perpetuating the tired old story that possible workplace sexual harassment “isn’t serious news”: This goes back to old narratives around sexual harassment, that it’s a “private sphere” thing and not serious business, like politics, which is seen to be a “public sphere” thing. Basically, sexual harassment is not “public news” but a “private matter”. It’s common and even expected. Anyone who calls this narrative out publicly, like Eugene, Zach and Keith, are publicly shamed and mocked.
4. Using an actor who, because of their identity, is statistically likely to be a victim, to play the role of casting doubt on whether events should “count” as workplace sexual harassment and “serious news”: The actor who plays the role of “the serious reporter” who wants to get “back to the serious actual news of politics” is played by a Black woman actor. The actor who plays a fan of the Try Guys and is defending their decision to take real action against possible workplace sexual harassment is a white man. How different would this skit be if the person being dismissed and talked over, because they were stating that an Asian American woman was possibly sexually harassed by their white and married boss, was a Black woman actor? I think it would feel a little too much like real life. Women, and especially women who also experience racial oppression and other kinds of oppression, for example, disabilities, are more likely to experience workplace sexual harassment. By making these casting choices they are actively obscuring the very “power dynamics” and “racism” that they are also mocking. Unacceptable.
5. Portraying events inaccurately or partially: In the sketch, they say something along the lines of “kissing an employee”. Even Ned’s statement implies that his actions involved more than this. I’m not saying this is what actually happened. We cannot know that, and it’s for the law to decide what happened. However, I don’t know how or why SNL would actively choose to portray his actions as “kissing an employee”. This seems minimising. Did they not research it properly? Did they actively minimise this to make it seem like it “wasn’t that big a deal”? In that case, it sounds very “Calm down, Sweetie, it wasn’t that big a deal,” which is just terrible. I don’t know which is the case, but either doesn’t show the skit in a good light. They make it sound like Ned “didn’t tell his friends” about something he did in his personal life and now they are “overreacting.” Those friends were his business partners who all took a risk together with Ned to found a startup. That startup was at least ¼ based on Ned being a “wife guy”, a persona he chose, when he could have been a “science guy” or “business guy” or anything else. This choice meant that he involved his wife and children in his public image and business. His wife worked at the company. He acted against his own personal brand and the brand of his company putting the jobs and careers of his wife, investors, business partners and staff in jeopardy. He could also have had an extramarital affair with anyone outside the company, this would then not have been workplace sexual harassment, but even so, he would still have been damaging a brand that he built together with his wife and business partners. It’s also important to note that Ned’s brand is inextricably tied up in the brand products, for example, fans might not watch old videos because Ned is in these videos. Therefore Ned’s actions retroactively damage existing products the Try Guys have spent eight years creating. In addition, all this comes at a time when the business was just reaching a new level of success by breaking into mainstream television with the Food Network show. I believe some of them, Zach for example, does have ambitions of working in mainstream television. How must this impact his career? Suffice to say, the other founders are validated in being upset for personal reasons, yes, but they are possibly even more validated in being upset for professional reasons.
6. Ignoring the possibility of professional misconduct and invalidating the appropriate reactions of business partners: We cannot know the official ins and outs of this situation but we know a little about how the company was structured. I believe they have said before that Ned managed many business processes including HR processes and company funds. If this is true, he could have been using these company processes to carry out non company activities for personal gain which might include sexual harassment. It might not be true. We cannot know. But the other owners of the company as well as their investors and staff are fully within their right to suspect this and be incredibly angry, worried and generally upset about it. It puts their current investments, current jobs and future careers in jeopardy.
7. Shaming men in power for acting appropriately when faced with the reality of sexual harassment by one of their business partners and friends: There are so many cases of men in power, especially straight white cis-gendered men in power, protecting their friends who are straight white cis-gendered men in power. In this case, the Try Guys have done the opposite. I’m not saying they should be praised and I don’t think they expect that. I’m saying that what they did should be the absolute bare minimum. Yet it is not. They are publicly mocked, shamed and treated as if they are overreacting. The SNL skit takes us in the opposite direction of where we should be going with these issues.
8. Shaming those who identify as men for displaying emotions: One of the reasons I like the Try Guys, and why I believe many fans like them, is because while they all identify as men, they actually express a wide range of emotions, not just anger, but sadness, joy, fear, disgust and everything in between. They’re not afraid of showing love for their friends, family, pets and communities. They’re not afraid of being categorised because of the silly things that bring them joy. They’re not afraid of being contradictory and of having irrational likes and dislikes. It makes me unbelievably sad that they would be “made fun of” for this. It’s horrible. Keith has spoken about how he had anxiety when buying groceries. Zach has a chronic disease spoken about how it has impacted him physically! How cruel can you be! How do we expect men to be honest about their emotions if this is how they are treated when they are being authentic? It’s terrible for men’s mental health and it enforces patriarchal values that hurt, not only men, but everyone.
9. Making the only gay and Asian member of the Try Guys seem violent: Fans know and absolutely adore Eugene for his nihilistic and unhinged humour. It’s something so-called “Millennials” and “Gen Zs” relate to. (We love you, please never change, Eugene.) But now that humour is being misinterpreted to make him seem violent and it is not lost on me, or, I think, any other Try Guys fan, that he is the only gay and Asian member of the Try Guys. This ties into a long history of deeply damaging tropes about gay and Asian men designed to keep people with these identities abused, oppressed and locked out of the power needed to change this situation. It’s absolutely inexcusable for them to have used this in their skit.
10. Encouraging a lack of gratitude for those who work “behind the scenes” in the video production industry: The skit seems to make fun of the Try Guys for thanking their editors for all the hard work they do. The Try Guys are a startup, albeit one with Buzzfeed support, and not working within a very large and established operation like SNL does, so, of course, the Try Guys editors will be struggling more and they, the founders, will be more grateful and thankful to their editors because they’ve done that work themselves. This shouldn’t be shamed, but be the bare minimum in the video production industry. Let’s respect and be grateful to everyone involved in delivering great content.

Some other silly (but also maybe kind of serious) issues:

1. The “food trying” comments at the end are not only racist but inaccurate: The food trying comments were both about “Asian” foods, “Cambodian” and “Malaysian.” Was that intentionally or accidentally a racist joke? Either way, it’s a bad look. Also, in the skit, Eugene and Zach were the ones who would theoretically try these foods. Keith is the only one not trying food! Like what? If they did their research they would know that it is Keith who definitely would be trying new foods surely. The others would too but like it’s not their “thing” like they could at least make Eugene rank some alcohol or play with puppies or something and have Zach do a weird candid competition. For some reason, this is the odd detail that makes me feel irrationally angry. I think this is because it feels like it shows just how little thought or care must have gone into it.
2. Ruining the Try Guys’ “first” SNL “appearance”: Some Try Guys admire some SNL writers and performers. I know from the TryPod episode “people we’re jealous of” that Keith and Zach admire some SNL writers and performers. I do too. It’s very sad to me that their “first appearance” on SNL is this real life nightmare of a skit. Should I blame Ned? The SNL writers or management? I don’t know. I just feel sad.
3. Ruining the “unique look” of their beautiful new office 😭: I remember watching the Architectural Digest video and seeing how much love and effort they put into designing their new office and how they wanted a “unique look” for their videos. Ariel was involved in this and did such incredible work. It hurt me so so much to see it shown in such a hurtful way in the SNL skit.
4. Implying that the Try Guys aren’t political: Throughout the skit the actor playing the “serious reporter” wants to get back to talking about politics. If they did any research at all they would realise that the Try Guys are very political. Think of Eugene’s latest Texas video. Think of everything Eugene has done for LGBTQIA+ rights. Think of Becky wearing a “protect trans kids” shirt. Think of Zach interviewing people with disabilities and discussing how the US government and CDC treated them during COVID. Think of Keith supporting Planned Parenthood in the nut challenge video.
5. Saying “What’s a Try Guy?” and mocking the Try Guys for “bravely” making content makes SNL look out-of-date: It might have been funny for an actor playing someone who is currently a child or a teenager to ask “What’s a Try Guy?” since it’s likely that most people who are fans of the Try Guys might be in their mid twenties or thirties right now, but when it comes from actors who are playing Millennials or Baby Boomers, it makes SNL seem out-of-date. In addition, listing the silly content they make and mocking them for making it “bravely” also makes SNL seem out-of-date. This is simply what people find entertaining. It provides audiences with comfort and develops a loyal and supportive fan base. This made me wonder whether SNL is maybe just making fun of YouTubers, TikTokers and other internet personalities. I know there is tension between more traditional media and internet personalities and I believe “Youtuber” “TikToker” and “influencer” are kind of dirty words if you are trying to make it in mainstream media. But I also know more people play video games and use TikTok than watch television or go to the movies these days, so really, video games and TikTok are, at least statistically, the mainstream, and maybe television shows like SNL feel threatened by this so they feel validated in attacking internet personalities whether intentionally or maybe even through some kind of unconscious jealousy. (Keith, cue the Olivia Rodrigo.)
6. Offending the fashion police 👠: This is just me being spicy but the person playing Eugene and whoever styled them did a complete disservice to Eugene’s beautiful outfit.

What did I miss? Anything else you would add?

I doubt anyone from SNL will read this, but we do know members of the Try Team sometimes browse this subreddit so maybe this thread might bring them some solace.

This skit has really made me feel like the world is such a horrible and cruel place.

1511,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-05-24 03:59:32,Naima92231,"At 61, It Occurs to Me That I'm Probably On the Autism Spectrum.","Last year I reconnected with a man I met in my late-20's (he's 6 years older), whom I considered a (very attractive) friend. I've know and cared about over the decades, but I got married, moved, had a wonderful son (now 24), eventually separated 
/divorced and move to another state with him, just to get away fro my ex.

But eventually I moved back (with my son) to the town I love the most, where my old friend still lives. He's 67, and I'm 61.

When we re-connected, he shortly thereafter went into the throes of some serious health complications. He'd lost a lot of weight and basically couldn't get up from his living-room floor to even feed himself, and was skeletal. So I brought him to my place for a while, where I could keep him fed, get him to doctors' appts., etc.

He continued to stay with me (or I'd stay at his place) after he got better. We were very affectionate with each other, but it was always platonic (not my idea--I'm seriously attracted to him, but I'm
not sure he understands why!).

Over time, he's become less physically affectionate (we've never even kissed). I don't mind (TOO much) not having sex, but we still sleep together sometimes and he's much less cuddly (not always, but more distant). I really miss that.

But he's warm and funny and talented and delightfully quirky. I love him as my best friend, but it's hard.

Anyway, a few months ago it dawned on me that he might be a very smart, high-functioning person on the spectrum. I slowly introduced the possibility to him--especially his sensory issues (I didn't question him much about sexuality), and a few other things. He seemed interested, and not insulted, by the possibility. We watched ""Rain Man,"", and now we're both always quoting from it.

I often tell him that, even when he makes no sense, he makes more sense to me than anyone. I trust him (not a common thing with me!), and I love him--I'm just not sure as WHAT, but that's pretty much okay. Well, sometimes it's been painful, but he knows that, and he's always kind and sweet (if a little hyper-critical sometimes). We tend to be there for each other, and he's obviously put effort into thinking about how I feel and adjusting how he responds.

I enjoy spending time with him more than anyone in years (aside from my soon, but that's different, of corse!).

I think that he and I tacitly agree that he's an ""aspie"" (I know that word's not used much any more), and, as I've learned more about it for his sake, I'm starting to believe (at 61!) that maybe I've been on the spectrum my whole life as well. For a long time I've thought that I have (and now get medicated for) ADD, but when I think back over my life and interactions I wonder..

I've taken a few online autism tests, with varying results, but today I took the AQ test and tested 33 out of 50! The questions can be so vague and difficult to answer, but I assume that's the way the tests are designed.

So, I guess, what next? I've never particularly trusted therapists. I just think back over my 6 decades, and how badly things often turned out at jobs, etc., and I guess I'd just like to understand. I know there's no magic pill for it, and I guess I'll always be this way.

But I've always carried a lot of shame and a lot of ""not quite fitting in,"" and I wonder if I can somehow reconcile all that, or if I can.

1512,yes,NewJerseyGardening,2023-03-11 17:45:15,Naima92231,When To Prune When the Weather Makes No Sense?!,"Hi, all. I live in Hoboken, and have a little backyard. It hadn't been tended to before I moved in, except for the occasional clearing out of MANY weeds, in decades. I don't want to pave it over, even though Hoboken soil doesn't seem to understand the point of ground-cover (I've tried using combinations of grass, wildflower, and clover--I want to keep it a bit of a sanctuary for the local birds, squirrels, etc., and eventually try to attract more butterflies and bees).

&#x200B;

There are two 60-year-old fig trees back there--they're easy. One quick, thoughtful pruning in late fall/early winter and they'll live forever.

&#x200B;

But I also planted several hydrangea bushes and roses back there, as well as a little dwarf weeping Japanese maple, which is doing surprisingly well. 

&#x200B;

Now, though, it's only 3/11, but the bushes are starting to bud and put out leaves. It's just been such a weird, warm, snowless winter that I think they're just confused. I know HOW to prune them, but I'm just wondering if I should do it now and hope there's not another hard freeze, or if I should wait a little longer. I don't want to mess my babies up!

I was raised Catholic, and have studied a lot of spiritual traditions, but Taoism had me at, ""The names that can be named are not the eternal name"" (not my favorite translation, but it's what I've got on hand at the moment).

I have never in my life doubted the existence of what many (myself included sometimes--maybe for the sake of convenience!) call ""God"" or ""the Divine."" I feel as if I've felt it all around me as a loving presence since I was a small child. And yet ""religion"" never made much sense to me. In church as a child, I used to refuse to say the words ""I believe in one holy and apostolic church,"" etc. HOW, I thought (even then) could one group of people believe that only they had it ""right""?!

I still feel that presence all the time, although I'm much closer now to feeling it as a uniform force running through everything. And yet I can still feel it as ""personal"" and loving at the same time. And I've come to believe that that's okay too. To put it simply, I guess it's like feeling that there are no ""rules""--kind as if everything is in everything, and without boundaries, and one can just take it as it comes. That makes me happy. There is little that I fear other than the little games my human brain can play with me about good/bad, right/wrong, what others think etc. I feel--cared for. All the time--even when ""things"" feel hurtful or frightening (not that I don't still get hurt or frightened).

Wu Wei doesn't come easily to someone raised in such a dogmatic institutional religion, but I know at my core that it just...works, if I let it (that's the trick, of course!). Even with Taoism, I often feel that I should be doing/changing things--how I live, what I eat 🤯, etc.). But I know that sitting, preferably in silence or with music (which I have called ""God's language"" which I guess might be considered kind of contradictory!), and just allowing things to play out as they will is really all that's necessary for me. Easier said than done, of course!

1514,yes,hysterectomy,2023-03-05 17:11:37,Naima92231,"Extra-Emotional Post-Surgery, Even Post-Menopause?","Hi, all, and thanks again for all your kind support.

It's now been six days since my hysterectomy, and physically I've been doing amazingly well--very little pain, almost no trouble walking, sitting up, bending, etc., almost no blood--although I HAVE been sleeping a LOT, which is probably good right now.

In the past few days, though, my emotions are a mess. For one thing, I finally realized that I need to stop seeing an old friend with whom I've been pretty much platonically sleeping for about six months (he's really a sweetheart, and he's the one who spent the night in the hotel by the hospital with me the night before surgery just for support, but I've known for a while that he's not over another, much younger woman with whom I guess he was involved a few years ago when I wasn't living in this town, and I finally realized--with the help of a VERY easy-to-interpret dream that was probably the result of Oxy a few nights ago--that for the sake of my mental health I need to stop seeing, and I told him last night). (He's 67 and I'm 61--just kids! :) ) 

I cried for over an hour last night--I almost never do that. And, although my recovery has been going remarkably well and I'm super-relieved it's over with, the past few days have been an emotional roller-coaster. It MAY just be because of my friend, and I was also being pretty unusually emotional before surgery (to the point where my adult son told me he was worried about me). And of course the pain meds may affect me too (although I haven't taken more than one Percocet a day).

But I've been looking all over the place online to try to find out whether ovarian cysts (I had a BIG one, which is why I needed the total hysterectomy) and/or the surgery itself and removal of organs, can cause any kinds of hormonal issues in POSTMENOPAUSAL women. I'm thinking it's probably mostly been just stress and sadness because of the guy and and the surgery, but I don't like feeling like this, and it still worries my son.

I didn't even shower yesterday, and I HATE going a day without a shower!

1515,yes,hysterectomy,2023-02-28 22:49:20,Naima92231,"So Far, So Weirdly Great!","Well, the deed (full hysterectomy/large cyst removal) was done yesterday. I was expecting all kinds of terrible things, but so far it was the best experience with surgery I've ever had (I even sent my surgeon a thank-you message today!).

I was mostly concerned (as was the surgeon) because I've got a lot of adhesions from previous abdominal surgeries. The procedure was supposed to be robotic, but there was a good chance they'd have to open me up...again. But NO! Just a couple of little punctures in my belly--not pretty, but a hell of a lot better than another real scar. And the cyst appears to have been benign. :)

So far, my belly is sore, obviously, but I've had no serious gas problems, and I have zero throat pain from the tube. There's only been a little blood, but it's tapering off.

I was surprised that they gave me TEN Oxy's, which do help with sleep and pain. I'd never take more than one a day, at night (a dose of Tylenol during the day).

I posted last week that I was hoping to drive to my friend's family's place with him this weekend. I actually think I could have been just fine for it, but it was cancelled because my friend's brother-in-law was also hospitalized. So maybe in a few more weeks, which will be even better.

The only thing that's got me seriously pissed off right now is that when I got home I found out that there's been a water-main break that has left the entire square-mile city completely without water. I need a shower!!!

1516,yes,hysterectomy,2023-02-24 01:54:11,Naima92231,Surgery Moved From 3/13 to This Monday-I Could Use Some Help Preparing!,"Reading through people's posts here, especially about what to expect post-op, has been SO helpful to me--thank you. I just have some questions, given my personal situation. Any advice would be really greatly appreciated!

In mid-December, during a visit to the ER for some pain that wasn't terrible, but was getting worse, a CT scan found an almost 12 cm. cyst on one of my ovaries. How I never noticed, I have no idea, but lately I very much notice--it hurts more all the time, and I've been afraid to move because it might torse or burst.

I originally had a full hysterectomy scheduled for about 2 weeks from now, and I was getting nervous about waiting that long. But this morning the hospital called and said there'd been a cancellation, and that I could get the surgery done this Monday (4 days from now). I just thought, ""YES! Just get this stupid thing out of me!!""

But I thought I'd have more time to prepare. From what I've been reading, it sounds as if I should buy some Gas-X or something ahead of time, as well as some pads for any bleeding (I haven't had a period in years, and even when I was young I'd sometimes go for months, or even over a year, without them, so I'm more clueless than most women about this stuff). But I have a miraculous wonderful 24-year-old son, so I don't need any of the stuff that's coming out!

So, my first question would be about what, exactly, I should have on hand ahead of time. I don't have a lot of time to get stuff, and I don't want to send my son or anyone else out to get me that stuff after the surgery (ESPECIALLY my son!). I haven't bought ""hygiene products""--especially pads--in, well, a really long time. I don't even know what to look for.

And then there's the fact that an old friend with whom I sleep relatively platonically (cuddling mostly, which is awesome for me at this point--not that I'm not seriously attracted to him!) asked me a few days ago to go to his sister's house, which is about an hour and 1/2 drive from here, to meet his mother and celebrate her 97th (!) birthday, as well as those of his brother and sister. (My friend is doing me the huge favor of staying at a hotel near the hospital with me the night before the surgery--that means so much to me, because I'm afraid I'll be a nervous wreck Sunday night.) 

But the family visit is less than a week after my surgery. I spoke to the PA at my surgeon's office, and she sounded a little wary but said that if I take it easy, avoid speed-bumps in the road (in New Jersey?!!), and stop to walk every so often during the drive to avoid blood-clots or something, it could be possible. I REALLY  want to go, but I'd kind of like to avoid bleeding all over my friend's sister's house, etc.

So I wanted to ask people who've experienced this in real-life--am I crazy to think I can make that trip? And, again, what should I have on hand for when I get home, and when I make the trip, if I do?

I've had lots of abdominal surgeries, and the last one was laparoscopic, and I was walking just fine the next day. This is a bit more radical, but (assuming nothing goes wrong during surgery) I'm pretty healthy otherwise, and I'm hoping that I can have my hysterectomy and eat (the cake) too.

1517,yes,ovariancysts,2023-02-18 15:59:46,Naima92231,More Ovarian Cyst Questions,"Hi, all. I've posted about the newest addition to my body--a complex septated cyst that's a little over 11 cm.--here a few times. I'm 61. I'm scheduled for a full hysterectomy by a very good oncological surgeon on 3/13--three months after the thing was accidentally found on CT in the ER (I'd gone in because of some weird pain). Seems like a long time, and one thing I'm wondering is how fast these things can grow (it's already shoving my uterus out of place, apparently).

So I've had all the imaging, and an appt. with a highly regarded surgeon in a few weeks, but I've been feeling a little weird in the past week or so, and have more questions...

First, I've never had terrible pain from this--just twinges here and there and feeling a little bloated, especially at night.

But lately I'm feeling more pain more often, including short, sharp pains in the area that should be around my liver. Is that ""normal,"" or could it mean that the cyst is malignant and has spread to my liver, or vice versa? Both my CA-125 and HE Whatever (sorry--I can't remember the name at the moment) were normal, and the cyst, aside from being big and septated and probably epithelial, so far doesn't show any other telltale signs of malignancy.

Also, I've been trying to stay strong by exercising (mostly a little barre, light weights, and walking), but things do start to hurt and fell like they're ""jiggling around"" when I'm walking, so I wonder if I should stop. I'd just like to be in the best shape possible for the surgery/recovery, but I definitely don't want to twist or burst the cyst while trying!

Finally, have cysts caused serious fatigue in anyone? Last night I planned to go out to see a band, and I was excited. I ate a little pizza and had my evening cocktail around 5 (that usually has little-to-no effect), and suddenly I HAD to go to sleep. I figured I'd nap 20 minutes or so, but I wound up sleeping for almost 3 hours, and even after that I could barely stay awake to change into nightclothes and brush my teeth. I was SO disappointed, but also concerned... I'm not normally a bundle of energy, but that was extreme fatigue. But so far this morning I'm okay.

So if anyone has any insight into/experience with any of the above, I'd love to hear from you.

And of course I'm happy to try to answer others' questions, when I can.

Yesterday I received the results of a pelvic MRI of a large (about the size of a medium potato 😱) cyst on my ovary. It was originally found almost by accident on a CT scan, followed by an ultrasound, and, finally the MRI. (I'm 61, btw.)

I managed to get an appointment with a gynecologist a week from now, but of course in the meantime I'm trying to ""translate"" the report for myself so I don't go completely nuts. 🤪

It's a ""large septated cystic mass,""
and ""raises the possibility of a cystic epithelial neoplasm."" It DOES say that no mural nodules were seen (that's a good thing, right?).

So I understand (sort of) most of the above, but then the report mentions ""a fluid signal intensity collection"" that ""demonstrates no significant enhancement""
near the ovary on the side where the cyst is and my cervix and vaginal fornix (?!!). It measures 2.1 x 0.9 cm.

So I'm just trying to understand if that has anything to do with ascites (or anything else relevant). Does it mesn there's fluid where there shouldn't be? Has anyone ever had anything similar going on?

So, as I mentioned in an earlier post, a large (11.9 x 8 x 11 cm.) ""septated cystic mass"" was found pretty much by accident in the ER when they did a CT scan originally. Next I had an ultrasound. My PCP said that so far there aren't any serious signs of malignancy, but I'm having an MRI tomorrow to see the rest, I guess.

My doctor also gave me the CA 125 test, which he said isn't a definite indicator, but might be useful. I just got the results-- normal range (13.1 U/ml.).

So, again, the mass is clearly going to have to come out before it takes over my entire torso (I'm wondering if a cyst that big can be removed laparoscopically). But I'm wondering--I know that ELEVATED ranges on the CA 125 can be misleading because that can be caused by other things, but how much of a sigh of relief (if any) can I take if it's normal?

As I've mentioned in other posts, I took brand-name Wellbutrin (300 mg. per day) 20 years ago, and it worked wonders.

However, these days (I started it again about a year ago, but could only get generic, of course) it seems to have little to no effect on me at any dosage I've tried so far--400 mg. is the highest dosage I've tried. I've got mild depression, and, as I suspected, I also have ADHD (great--finding out at age 60!). This morning I spoke to a psychiatrist, particularly to confirm my hunch about the ADHD (once I'd told him some of the many incidents that made me believe that, as well as the fact that my son was dx'd with it in high school, he didn't seem to need any more convincing--I think it's pretty clear). I also told him about the fact that Bupropion doesn't work NEARLY as well for me the first time around, when it felt miraculous.

We discussed ADHD meds, including Strattera, but he seemed to feel strongly that I should try a month or so of 450 mg. Bupropion per day before we try anything else (the idea of stimulants makes me nervous, but if a small dose would work I'd be willing to try it). I told him that I doubted that raising the Bupropion dosage would do much good, but I agreed to give it a try.

The psychiatrist wanted to try to get the 450 XL, once a day, for me, but my insurance won't cover it. So we went to option B, which was 300 mg. in the morning and 150 mg. at night. I assumed they'd both be SR, but when I picked them up I saw that they're both XL, which seemed weird. The pharmacist, however, seems to think it's fine. And I liked the psychiatrist (that's unusual!); he seemed knowledgeable and actually LISTENED to me--remarkable!

So I'm just wondering if anyone has ever tried that combination before (in the XL formulations), and if it helped for either ADHD or depression (or both), or was just too much. I assume that the doctor and the pharmacist know what they're doing, but I'd like to hear about some real-life experiences from anyone who has tried it. It just seems like a LOT!

1524,yes,bupropion,2022-06-24 14:06:08,Naima92231,Will Decreasing My Dosage of Bupropion Improve Memory Issues?,"Hi, all. I have another question about Bupropion.

Twenty years or so I got on 300 mg. Wellbutrin (brand-name at the time!) for depression and other symptoms that, at the time, I didn't realize were probably caused by undiagnosed ADHD. It was AMAZING how well it worked, and (as many others have said here) I felt that I was getting a sense of what it's like to have a ""normal"" (whatever that is :) ), functioning brain. I took it for a few years, and eventually stopped without any issues.

THIS time around, I started it again because I was coming off of about 10 years of Tramadol use (prescribed to me before it was deemed a controlled substance--I still think there should be a class action lawsuit...different subject!). I never took more than 100 mg. per day (usually just 50), but it was hellish to come off of it. Thank God I found that weed made the withdrawal symptoms practically disappear, so I was able to do it. But I figured I might need some help regulating my emotions after that big change, and I also finally realized that I probably really do have ADHD (I'm getting evaluated in a few weeks).

My doctor started me off at 150 mg. Bupropion (I couldn't get the brand-name any more!), and after a couple of weeks went up to 300 mg. XL. I felt exactly zero difference--it wasn't anything like my Wellbutrin experience 20 years ago. I may as well have been taking M & M's.
So I thought, well, maybe I should try 400 mg. per day (2 x 200SR per day). Again...no difference in mood or focus or energy.
However, shortly after I came off of the Tramadol and started Bupropion again, I started to notice memory issues that I'd never noticed before. At first I figured that maybe it was just a side-effect of stopping years of Tramadol use. Mostly, it's short-term stuff--losing the thread of conversations, not being able to remember if I'd already washed my face when I was taking a shower, etc., and--most annoying--these memory ""delays"" in which I'll think of something, immediately forget what it was for a few seconds to a couple of minutes, and then remember again. I HATE it. And so far Bupropion hasn't helped with that either. My brain feels like an old junkyard cluttered with stuff that barely works (when I took the name-brand decades ago that stuff disappeared, like, immediately...it was heavenly).

So now I'm going to experiment with lower doses. Right now I'm at 275 mg. (started yesterday with 200 SR in the morning, and 75 SR in the evening). I'd like to get it down to 150 mg. XL to find out if it might work better and help with memory issues, etc., if I'm on a lower dose. I KNOW that Wellbutrin was the only antidepressant that ever worked for me, so I don't understand why it's not working now.
I do still use weed ONLY at night before bed, because it helps me sleep and stops nighttime/early morning panic attacks cold. It probably takes me close to three months to go through an ounce, so it's really very little.

I've cut down alcohol to maybe a glass of wine (maybe two drinks if I'm out at a restaurant) per day. I know that's not a great idea, but it really is minimal, and I'm pretty sure I drank more than that the first time I took Wellbutrin, and had no issues.

SO (as always, I end up writing overly long posts...sorry!), I'm just trying to find out if anyone can give me any insight into (a) why I might suddenly be having memory issues that I didn't have before, and (b) if anyone has found that Bupropion actually works better, or at least as well, at lower doses.

I'm at my wit's end with this--I was so sure that Bupropion would just kick in and help me as it did the first time I took it, and I'm really disappointed!

1525,yes,bupropion,2022-06-14 00:11:15,Naima92231,Will My Brain Ever Be Normal Again Post-Tramadol?,"Hi, all. About 11 years ago, my body seemed to be just falling apart for no apparent reason. I could barely sit up most of the time, I was losing weight like crazy (unusual for me, and good until it wasn't), and I was in pain and practically non-functional. I went to a health clinic in FL. At first the doctors thought it might be MS or something, but all that was ruled out. It turned out that I had a serious sensitivity to gluten (I'd never even heard of it before, so I wasn't trying to be trendy--I'd still kill to eat a regular baguette or something), perhaps triggered by some serious stressors at the time.

Anyway, I was prescribed Tramadol. I'd never heard of that either. This was about a year before it was classified as a controlled substance (I keep thinking that the company that made it and passed it off as non-addictive should be sued).

So I started taking it every evening--just 50 mg., although occasionally I'd do 75 or 100 mg. if I was having more pain than usual, or if I needed to be ""up"" for something. At that time I wasn't drinking, fortunately. I did figure out after a while that if I missed a dose I'd start to have withdrawal symptoms, so good call, too late, on re-classifying the drug. :(

I took it for about 10 years altogether--again, never more than 100 mg. tops per day. A year ago I decided it was time to go through the hell of quitting, and, with the help of weed (which usually stopped most of the withdrawal symptoms right away, at least for a while so I could get some sleep), I finally tapered off last May. I will never touch that shit again--it acts as both an SSRI and an opioid, so that really complicates getting off of it.

I started taking Bupropion (Wellbutrin) shortly after that. I'd taken it 20 years earlier, and it was amazing--both for my depression and my ADHD. This time, though, it has had much less of a positive effect on me. I also noticed that once I quit the Tramadol I started having short-term memory problems--kind of like a ""delay,"" where I'd think of something and totally forget what it was for a minute or so, and then remember again. It's been a year, and I'm still on the Bupropion, and I'm still pretty spacey and feel that my ADHD is REALLY bad now.

Sorry for the long background story, but I'm just trying to find out if others who have quit Tramadol had issues with memory, depression, etc., even a year afterwards. I'm 60, so it's possible that I've just been having ""senior moments"" (even though I don't feel like a senior!), but I don't recall having them until just after I quit the Tramadol. It's also upsetting that the Bupropion, which had been life-changing 20 years earlier, has so much less of a positive effect even after taking it for a year (I just upped my dose from 300 mg. to 400 mg. per day about two weeks ago, so I'm waiting to see if that will help). I HATE feeling so stupid and spaced out, and getting so little done because my brain keeps skipping from one thought to another and I'll go off to do something else before I'm done with the first thing. It's embarrassing, and I don't want my son to notice and worry when he comes home from college. I think I'd shoot myself before making him have to take care of me if I got dementia. And my thoughts about myself are often uncharacteristically negative (I'm not suicidal at all--just feeling guilt and shame about so many things in my past).

Anyone out there have similar experiences (preferably encouraging ones, although I need to hear everything)? Thank you.",2,3,3,0.81,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='vbqece')>,,/r/bupropion/comments/vbqece/will_my_brain_ever_be_normal_again_posttramadol/,False
1526,yes,CannabisExtracts,2022-05-18 18:07:21,Naima92231,Is Dosage the Same for High-THC Tinctures If Swallowed Instead of Taken Sublingually?,"Hi all. I've been experimenting with making tinctures with high-THC flower and Everclear. So far I've only used them sublingually, with mixed results, but my most recent mixture (23% THC flower; about 2 ounces Everclear per 1/8th ounce bud; sat for a week) seemed to work best so far. With that, I've found that about 1.5 ml. makes me feel it, but not too strongly.
I've been considering just swallowing it so that it lasts longer (I mostly use it to help me sleep at night without weird panic attacks that seem to come out of nowhere in the middle of the night or first thing in the morning, and also to listen to music as I fall asleep--the latter is one of my favorite activities, because I feel as if I hear every nuance of every instrument, and it's beautiful!). But I'm wondering if the dosage should be the same if I just drink it, or if the effects will be stronger. I wouldn't mind having a somewhat more intense experience, but ONE time I ate ONE gummy (I'm not sure how many mg. it was), and felt like I was going to die for several hours (thank God my son told me not to take more than one, because if I'd taken two I think I'd have ended up in the ER). I don't want to repeat that experience (although I think my tolerance is a little higher now)!
So--bottom line--given that I've used the same recipe and flower to make a tincture, would 1.5 ml. sublingually be the same as 1.5 ml. swallowed? I know that I'll have to wait a lot longer to feel the effects, so I'd like to avoid waiting 2 hours worrying if I'm going to be pleasantly high, or curled up in fetal position in bed, waiting for it to be over!",9,2,2,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='usiyuf')>,,/r/CannabisExtracts/comments/usiyuf/is_dosage_the_same_for_highthc_tinctures_if/,False
1527,yes,AskVet,2022-04-22 13:45:51,Naima92231,Seasonal/vaccine-related seizures in 5-6-year-old dog?,"Hello. I have a very healthy 6-year-old Pit/Boxer mix (about 52 lbs.) whom I adopted from a shelter when she was a few months old. Aside from occasional GI issues (short-lived, and never terribly serious--the usual stuff), she's never had a health problem. She IS, however, an anxious dog who gets nervous when things change, or aren't in their usual places, etc. She falls in love with everyone she meets, but is very unwilling to go on walks, etc., with anyone except me. She is a sweetheart.
About 2 years ago, around May or early June, she had her first two 2 relatively mild seizure events (no loss of consciousness or ""paddling""--just unable to stand, shaking violently, smacking her lips, and looking terrified) about a week apart. Her vet checked her blood, and said that everything looked normal. There were no more incidents until...
The following spring, last year, she went to the vet 2 separate times within a few weeks for her boosters and rabies shots. Within between a few days to about 3 weeks after both visits, she had multiple instances of the same kind of events of varying length and severity (again, no loss of consciousness, etc., although one time she lost control of her bowels, which would NEVER happen otherwise).
I talked to the vet about it, and she asked me to keep a log. I also asked her about CBD, and, although she couldn't ""officially"" recommend it, she did say that some of her patients had had good results with it. So I started her on CBD oil--.5 ml. of 1200 mg. oil 2x per day.
A week after we started the CBD oil (I believe it takes a little time to start working), she had another 9-minute long episode (I got video of that one). It was awful, but, as usual when it ended she was back to normal and just wanted to go outside. That was 23 days after her last booster last year. It was on April 30th, and she had no more until...
Exactly one week after THIS year's boosters, which were given on 30 March, she had another episode. She was shaking so hard I was terrified she'd die. After about 5 very long minutes, she was fine again.
(I should also mention that she had an apparently benign mast cell tumor removed from near one of her nipples a few months ago, in winter, and she's recovered well, except that she is now terrified of the vet's office...understandably, as the procedure was no doubt really frightening for her. But there were no subsequent seizures then.)
Sorry for the long background story!
Of course I started to associate the seizure events as being related to the vaccinations, but I've seen very little reliable info online making that correlation, and the vet says it's not likely. But why do they always happen only in the spring, and within a few weeks of boosters?
The other thing I learned from ""Dr. Google, Veterinary Edition"" is that boosters for distemper/parvo/bordatella, etc., only usually need to be given every THREE years--NOT every year, as we've been doing per the vet office's suggestions. I've also read that multiple vaccinations boosters given at one time might be too much.
So...long story short... could this all somehow be coincidence? I'm wondering if (a) she's predisposed to seizures, and either the stress of the vet visits and/or the boosters themselves can trigger them, or if they can be seasonal. (I don't use fertilizers or pesticides in the yard, she doesn't go to dog parks, and we take our walks on city streets, away from other dogs. I have no plans to ever board her anywhere.)
One more thing--she's EXTREMELY heat-intolerant, which I assume is due to the Boxer in her.

my dreams are really psychosomatic too. i can wake up with sensations from the dream. in the one last night where glass shards were embedded deep into my arm, i woke up with a stinging feeling in that arm. i also have fibromyalgia(and autism) though, so i’m not surprised i feel pain and bad sensations even in my dreams.

The dramatic changes in technology in the past several years, especially with AI, have started overwhelming me, and I don’t know how i’ll cope with it. It’s making me realize just how resistant to change I really am, at least technologically. I feel confused with my reactions, questioning if i’m really open minded, when I feel fear and even disgust about everything changing too fast.

we are in between an old meal and a new one, and making the new one tonight, so those days in between are often hard for me. i don’t really snack. i’m afraid eventually i’ll get sick of every food we can think of making, and i’ll have nothing left. that sounds absurd, but it’s not totally unrealistic. i’m already almost sick of all the recipes i’ve worked hard to collect. my appetite is so bad it scares me, and i’m sick of being hungry so often. i wish i had safe foods at all, but i get tired of every single thing if i eat it too much. the only thing approaching a safe food for me is more like “save for emergencies,” because if i eat it too much, i’ll get sick of it and it won’t be an option anymore. is this a form of ARFID? it doesn’t sound like descriptions, but it’s absolutely a distressing disorder of some kind, even if it doesn’t have a name.

edit: idk what other symptoms are ARFID-like, but i can get sick of being around food, especially smells. it used to be much worse when i was severely depressed. i couldn’t even talk about food or see an image of food without feeling sick. i fucking hate fast food ads. i have sensory processing disorder though.

i’ve found that i’m a highly sensory person, more than what is typically seen in autism. i’m very passionate about nature and art, and i have quite bad sensory processing issues. i am in love with sensations like touch, smell, etc. and i am unbelievably sensitive to my environment. it’s like there is no barrier. if it’s unclean, ugly, reminds me of trauma, loud, uncomfortable in any way, and so forth. i’m equally sensitive to pleasant things, so it can be very pleasurable, but also debilitating. 

i find that i need a lot of variety and novelty as a person, and hate routine. doesn’t sound too autistic, i know. but where i desperately need things to stay the same is my environment. it’s so hard for me to deal with sensory stressors, and if i can ever find a safe and comfortable enough space, i’m so disturbed if things change without my say-so.

we are moving in a couple months. i’m extremely worried. after almost a decade, i’ve found a place i feel at home in, and i really like. the traffic sounds torment me constantly, so i wouldn’t miss that, but i know being uprooted will be hellish, especially since i have fibromyalgia and CPTSD, which i know will be triggered by everything. to make matters worse, we have to stay in a camper for a short time between finding a house. more instability. the house will be new and unknown, so i won’t feel safe or like i can hide, there will be boxes everywhere. i know i may really like our next place, but it won’t have any of the quirks of our house now, so i’ll constantly be comparing and won’t let it go. 

i’m so worried. i am not being pessimistic or psyching myself out to say that i’m certain i will get terribly shutdown and my pain will flare up from all the stress. this wasn’t really the main point of the post, but it’s related, so i guess i wanted to share it. if you have anything to say about either points, i’d appreciate some info/support. thanks.",2,10,10,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='122xwgf')>,,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/122xwgf/does_you_intolerance_for_change_involve_the/,False

Currently the “hip” thing for socks right now is white tube socks that go above the knee almost like a high sock. Back when I was a teenager the “hip” thing was short ankle black socks. My generation thought high white tube socks was an old person thing. Now gen Z thinks short ankle black socks are an old person thing. Back in the 90’s high white tube socks was hip, they thought black socks were an old people thing. It’s a 1 2 1 2 1 2 pattern.

1620,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-05-20 18:18:32,BigBuns2023,"Regarding beer, how do you all feel about it?","Ok so I hate light beer such as Budlight, miller light, corona, modelos, seltzers, etc etc, basically anything below 7% alcohol I see as pointless. They have no flavor and taste like pee water half the time and don’t get you buzzed or drunk and they make you pee a lot.  You can drink 4 and not feel drunkish

I enjoy IPA and lagers and other beers because they’re usually higher in alcohol content so they have about 7%+ most of the time so you can drink one and feel content and buzzed. They also have more flavor and are genuinely enjoyable to drink.

My favorite at the moment is voodoo ranger 9.5% Fruit haze (the ones in the orange can) because they taste good, and one can will get you nice and buzzed for a while. So you spend less money, drink less to get the same buzz as drinking about 3-4 regular light beers and they don’t give you hang overs because they don’t have much sugar.

Is this just an autistic mindset ? I think about consuming alcohol very objectively. If I have the option between a light beer and water I’d rather drink just water.

How do you feel about this? (If you drink of course, if you don’t I understand)

Update: seems like most of you don’t really enjoy drinking but for the few that do they seem to enjoy hard ciders and lagers and fruity mixed drinks or a form of gin or vodka.

Just came out today. I thought some of you all would be interested!

> Here at last is an exciting new translation of the modernist Brazilian epic Macunaíma, by Mário de Andrade. This landmark novel from 1928 has been hugely influential. It follows the adventures of the shapeshifting Macunaíma and his brothers as they leave their home in the northern Amazon for a whirlwind tour of Brazil, cramming four centuries and a continental expanse into a single mythic plane. Having lost a magic amulet, the hero and his brothers journey to São Paulo to retrieve the talisman that has fallen into the hands of an Italo-Peruvian captain of industry (who is also a cannibal giant). Written over six delirious days – the fruit of years of study – Macunaíma magically synthesizes dialect, folklore, anthropology, mythology, flora, fauna, and pop culture to examine Brazilian identity. This brilliant translation by Katrina Dodson has been many years in the making and includes an extensive section of notes providing essential background information for this magnificent work.",2,10,10,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13k7mgc')>,,/r/darkstartril/comments/13k7mgc/this_newly_translated_novel_sounds_like_a/,False

It does not happen if I'm sexting (like, I had a long distance thing with someone, and I experienced the same level of arousal I would in person, but I didn't get a period or spot), it doesn't happen when I masturbate, and it doesn't seem to have any correlation with whether or not I orgasm (based on what's happening currently) or whether or not I've had actual penetrative sex.

A couple years ago, I binged through the entirety of the Vampire Diaries and the Originals. Sometime after, I did a rewatch of TVD because I had gotten my sister into it.

1649,yes,ADHD,2021-05-11 19:45:55,mandelaXeffective,Improved procedural memory as compensatory adaptation for working memory deficits?,"So there is something I've noticed about myself that I am curious about.

The first way I noticed it was when I used to dance. In dance classes, it always seemed like it would take me a bit longer than my classmates to learn each piece of a routine. However, once I *did* manage to learn it, I would often (and I'm not just saying that this was just how I perceived it, my teachers usually noticed too) seem to actually know it better, somehow, than my classmates. I hadn't been diagnosed yet at the time (I was diagnosed when I was 19), so I had no idea why that might be, but now (at 27) that I have been diagnosed, medicated, and have learned more about ADHD, this is the best explanation I can come up with:

The difficulty and delay in learning the routines would make sense in the context of ADHD-related working memory deficits, so that part was pretty easy to figure out; the rest of it didn't make as much sense until I was having a hard time explaining to my family why I was so rigid about my morning routine and where I kept the stuff I needed to get up, get dressed, eat, and get to work, and why it was so *disruptive* if something wasn't where it was supposed to be or if I ran out of cereal or anything like that. I didn't know. Then when I started joining a lot of ADHD Facebook groups, this subreddit etc., it occurred to me that the fact that I almost never lose my keys or my wallet or my purse (my phone is another story) and that I almost never forget any of the above when going out was actually kind of unusual for someone with ADHD, and I started to make the connection: I somehow seemed to have adapted to compensate for my working memory problems with strong *procedural* memory in certain areas of my life. Instead of trying to hold ""purse, phone, keys, water bottle, jacket"" etc. in my working memory every time I go to walk out the door, I only have to hold ""phone, water bottle, jacket"" etc., which is much more manageable. My keys and my purse have designated spots, which are both close to each other and close to the door. Grabbing them is a practiced set of fluid motions, like a dance, and takes very little thought. I use this for a lot of things and I'm apparently very good at it. 
Anyways that's a very long explanation for a very short question: has anyone else noticed this about themselves?",10,21,21,0.97,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='na5t9b')>,,/r/ADHD/comments/na5t9b/improved_procedural_memory_as_compensatory/,False
1650,yes,CreditScore,2021-05-08 20:13:56,mandelaXeffective,Credit score took a big hit because of car accident (not at fault),"So my car was totaled back in December (it got hit while it was parked in my driveway). I got a payout for the majority of my remaining loan from the insurance of the guy who hit it, which took a while and I had to make a payment on that loan in the process. Before that went through, another payment came due and I absolutely could not afford to make another payment on a car I no longer had, since I had already bought another one, which I now needed to start paying off. So it was past due when the insurance payout went through. For some odd reason, the payout didn't count as a payment, so it just continued to become increasingly delinquent. I had gap insurance on the car I lost, so the account did end up paid off completely, but that only just got put through like, last week.

Before all this, I had worked really hard to get my credit score up over 700 (729 on TransUnion, 730 on EquiFax) and when I was replacing the car I lost was finally able to get approved for a loan without a cosigner. The inquiries to get the new loan obviously dinged my score a bit (about 40 points), but I was prepared for that.
But the delays with getting the other loan paid off caused it to go down *another* 40 or so points and since getting it paid off, it has only gone back up about 5 points. Am I gonna have to basically build it back up all over again? Or is it just too soon to see the impact of getting the old loan cleared?
And if it's the former, is there *anything* I can do about it? It seems really unfair.",5,1,1,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='n7xh04')>,,/r/CreditScore/comments/n7xh04/credit_score_took_a_big_hit_because_of_car/,False

I always swallow pills with water. It doesn't happen every single time, but I would say it happens more often than not. It's quite painful (probably about a 4 on the pain scale) and most of the pain is in my chest, so I'm not actually sure if it's gas in my stomach or if it's in my esophagus. Once it happens, I find it very difficult to burp to expel it. I'm pretty sure the fact that I'm swallowing air and the fact that it's getting stuck are two separate issues, and the latter has actually been happening as a general problem for over a year now (sometimes spontaneously), though it's otherwise improved more recently. 
I've had both a colonoscopy and upper endoscopy (a little over a year ago now) as well xrays of my chest and abdomen, and the only abnormal finding was a tortuous colon. No hiatal hernia or any other abnormalities were found in my stomach or esophagus (my mom has a hiatal hernia, so that was one of the first things we checked for).
When I do manage to burp, if it's first thing in the morning and I haven't eaten, the burps have an unusual taste that I can really only describe as being akin to canned mushrooms. 
I do not smoke and I very rarely chew gum or drink soda or other carbonated beverages.

I am a 27 y.o. female (nonbinary, she/they)
Everyone in my immediate family, myself included, has a prescription for omeprazole to treat GERD.

I still can't stop. I still give people who hurt me chance after chance because except in very specific moments where I am reminded or thinking about it, like right now.

The decorations are space themed (dark blue, some white, a tiny bit of bright green). Lisa Frank/rainbow and cartoons (rainbow, bright green). And a collection of cutesy things, which have some bright green but mostly pink and lavender.

The purple and dark blue walls will touch, and the light colored walls will touch. My idea is that the rainbow and cartoon deco will go against the purple wall. The cutesy deco will go against the white wall, and the light blue and dark blue wall will have most of the space deco. Because every collection of decorations has a bit of bright green, I feel like that will help it feel more well-rounded.

A heads up, this is a long post talking about myself and stuff I like lol. If you like the same stuff, reach out? :)

I have Friendproject and email to keep in touch on. If I'm not able to access my laptop I probably just can't chat, so I prefer messaging on email or friendproject to chatting- I have a 12-key phone and typing just for fun isn't fun lolol. This is usually a disqualifier. I do have discord but I rarely use it. It glitches pretty bad and I miss messages, I never figured out how to fix it.

\-

I'm interested in horror, especially horror films but also novels and psychological horror of any kind. Crime thrillers and crime-drama-thrillers are my favorite genres, top movies have to be... Faces in the Crowd and Before I go to Sleep. Love that kind of movie. I also hate-watch Lifetime Movie Network stuff and hatewatching movies is one of my favorite things to do lol.

I used to write fiction and fanfiction, and roleplay novella too, but at the moment I'm not in a good place to do that, always too much going on to really sit and focus on it. Ever read any BatJokes? You might've read one of mine...

I hope to get back there one day but in the meantime I'm focusing on pixel/digital art and plotting out future novels, TV shows, whatever- I like creating, in any form. And creativity, so anything you have to share, I have eyes to read or see it lol.

I'm super into like, mid 2000s-alternative aesthetics and just nostalgia in general. Hence the 12-key flip phone. I've been watching Invader Zim and other shows I used to like; South Park, The Looney Tunes Show (the sitcom one, not the originals), Danny Phantom.

I also am getting into Korean drama and horror series, right now I'm watching Flowers of Evil and I'm partway through it and I've always loved Korean horror in general. Not too into Kpop specifically but I like some songs here and there like with any genre- my playlists are allllll over the place fr.

Some of my more cringe interests that I'm getting back into are scene aesthetic, Vocaloid, and cartoons (like Danny Phantom, Invader Zim, etc). And probably a lot more? Idk, I'm pretty unashamedly cringe lmao. I wear my autism on my sleeve and I'm super queer and love that about me. I lost myself trying to hide the cringe and I was never more unhappy in life than then, lol. I'm happier now that I'm being me again.

&#x200B;

Oh, also, I LOVE the subject of psychology and especially abnormal and developmental psychology. I could talk about theories and research on those subjects for hours (but I won't, unless you want to). If you know anything about autism, psychology is my all-time special interest. Followed by autism itself, which feels like its own branch of psychology?

spoons had run out with about four hours to go. tried to have a chat with a person and it was awkward so kept out of the way as much as possible until i had to do more work.

then people were kind and offered to help me out with work but i declined because i didn't have the energy to do the masking (sometimes the masking is friendly and okay but sometimes it doesn't function properly and i seem a bit odd but try and other times - very rarely - i don't try and i am just silent) but help would've been nice to be honest. also, i think refusing help is probably not very good for good social relations as i know i can come across as a bit aloof - sometimes the masking is quite good but if i have time for free social chat it is usually a bit of a nightmare generally.

i wanted to say ""i appreciate your offer of help and i would take it but i find social stuff quite difficult and i don't know you guys very well and i would concentrate more on the communication than my job and i would find that harder than refusing your help"" but i am guessing that would sound very weird (i'm not out at work obviously). 

anyway, how do you deal with this situation? my job's management failures are making these situations arise where i have to refuse help when i shouldn't need help but i am also aware that i'm not really sure how i can learn what to do when i run out of spoons. i guess it would be nice to be awkward/odd and people didn't think anything of it (or to not have to talk/interact but that seems unlikely). if the spoons are gone they are gone. usually, before learning about spoons (i'm a late learner about these things), i would end up leaving jobs because of this kind of thing.",9,8,8,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='121xt4h')>,,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/121xt4h/what_are_you_doing_if_the_spoons_have_run_out_but/,False

1690,yes,penpalsover30,2023-02-13 13:44:58,No-Macaroon-9902,38M UK here for penpals,"Hello,

I'm a single man who lives in one of the quiet corners of the UK. 

I once had a penpal from South Korea for 8 years. We didn't send each other lots of letters but once or twice a year it was always nice to send and receive something.

I'm looking for email conversation to begin with and if we both want to I am happy to move to real letters instead/as well.

The main thing that interests me in life is music. I like many genres of music. I started listening to pop music around 10, moved to hip-hop at 12, found punk at 15, found noise at 20 and from there it has been a bit of everything. My constant companions seem to be jazz and minimal classical music. I sometimes prefer sound to music. I like that there are people who have spent time thinking about what we think of as music and what we think of as noise. I also like that some people apply this type of thinking to natural sounds and how we influence them.

I like nature. I don't think I know too much about nature but I know I like walking and looking at the birds and insects and tufts of grass a person might stumble across. Hills or the coast are my favourites. 

I am not very good at watching tv shows or films at home. I prefer watching films at the cinema but it is difficult to find a cinema that doesn't just show new films from America. I do realise this is probably because the cinemas want to make money. 

I recently bought a piano and after not having access to instruments while living abroad for the past 7 years I am enjoying it very much. I'm not sure anybody else with ears would enjoy it but thankfully I can plug in headphones.

I can generally hold a conversation and find people quite interesting. Text based me is better at conversation than flesh based me. It would be nice to share some interests with someone but sometimes it is more interesting when people are very different. I probably prefer science fiction to other fiction. I am not a miserable person but do have longterm experience with depression. I like to drink tea and eat marmalade on toast. I like creativity even if that creativity is deemed not very good.",1,2,2,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='1118kpb')>,,/r/penpalsover30/comments/1118kpb/38m_uk_here_for_penpals/,False

I recently bought a digital piano (Yamaha P45) and I am now ready to learn.

I have found a local teacher who will help me with the ABRSM grades but I was wondering how other people would go about reaching my goal of being able to play jazz (not just learning others' songs but to improvise and compose myself).

If following the ABRSM classical route is a good way to go at what stage should I start moving my learning over to something more jazz focused? Do you recommend trying to make it to grade 8 in theory and practice before even looking at jazz?

i've been slowly moving my life towards one that is a bit kinder to myself/easier to manage but there are things that i feel that i want to do but just can't seem to do. depending on the day these can be small things or things that have been long term goals that i still can't seem to start.

1693,yes,autismUK,2023-01-05 12:13:15,No-Macaroon-9902,Anyone else good at seeming initially okay at fitting in but over time not fitting in much?,"I think I am writing this with the hope of hearing other people having the same experience but things are feeling a bit lonely at the moment.

I've been working at a place for about six months and I'm quite good at being basic friendly (I think) and I can't help but being a people pleaser (hoping to change that - I've been saying this for about 12 years) but beyond that I have no idea how to really be a person and I've reached that stage where I am noticing my inability to have conversation and realising other people have noticed as well. I've started falling back onto my avoidant behaviours so I don't have to have social interactions but I see that they make my life harder.

I think what happens is that I seem friendly to start with so people maybe think I will be a person who will be friendly but the problem is that initial friendly is all I have to offer. I feel a bit like a robot who only has one setting. I see now that I should maybe try to get help for this problem rather than structuring my life so I don't have to deal with social things much (it hasn't made life very satisfying and usually the problems with the social side create anxiety so I go a bit avoidant and then that makes life more difficult and I end up depressed).

Is anyone else a bit like this? How have you made this problem not such a problem? I've reduced my hours at work because in the past I would usually try to continue as normal and spiral into a deep depressive state but I really don't want to be unemployed again. Reducing my hours does mean I can't pay rent to so I am going to be living with family for the foreseeable future (a situation I was really hoping to change by summer). This is the first time in my life I have really noticed how other people communicate and that I am kind of on my own with not being a part of that (it has taken me about 20 years to realise). I don't think I want to learn how to be a part of that side of things but I would like to know how to not feel uncomfortable and not let that uncomfortableness dictate my life.

They came back the day after and “fixed” it, I paid them another $200 + tip. Two hours later, the washing machine wasn’t working anymore.

I immediately called them and they told me not to worry, they would come back the day after. That was last Wednesday and they haven’t. Every time I call them they give me a bs excuse and promise me they’ll come soon.

Mind you, I’m not from the US, things like this are a little more informal in my country, so it’s not necessarily strange to pay people upfront and just trust they will complete the service, normally there are no problems.

But, I’m feeling iffy about this and I’m now assuming I’ve been scammed for $400 USD. I’m researching my legal options, but knowing my country’s justice system, I don’t have a lot of hope.

This is not the first time something like this happens to me (fortunately not as expensive), but I’m constantly in situations where people just take advantage of me and I don’t notice until later or when someone else tells me what happened.

1862,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-03-31 10:19:56,TgellanMonarth,Paradox: Feeling embarrassment by proxy,"Maybe someone might be able to understand this, when I have difficulty myself. Basically, one of my preferred genres of TV is comedy, but I can't deal with sitcoms. When a character does something remarkably questionable, i.e. the whole premise of sitcoms, I feel so embarrassed for them that I cannot watch. I cover my eyes, look anywhere but the TV, develop an overwhelming interest in the stray strings on my bracelet. Grit my teeth until it is over. It almost physically hurts because I am really good at blundering full speed ahead and realizing only later that I once again made an utter fool of myself. It doesn't feel like it is happening to me, but I just have this visceral reaction. This should be my cup of tea, but instead it is horrible. My partner watches a particularly popular show that has been in reruns since before I was born. Nightly. My husband before him watched the same show. I can identify an episode in seconds without seeing the screen, so I should be numb to this by now, but it is still ... Uncomfortable? Painful? I don't know how to describe it. 
In real life, I don't tend to sense people's emotions until they hit me over the head with them, but these shows make it pretty clear what is coming. 
Part of it may be that much of what I learned of how to exist in society was by negative example. Mom saying ""that person is so ugly they shouldn't be allowed to breed"" (gosh, mom, what do you think about me, then?) Or calling someone else's kid an ""unsuccessful biological experiment"".
Not surprisingly, I am also still embarrassed about incidents when I was a kid, like stepping up too early at the spelling bee in 3rd grade.

1867,yes,modernwarfare2,2023-03-12 15:18:51,bwssoldya,Lag or performance issues or something else?,"So I've been noticing that when I play during my peak hours (EU, CEST+2), the game seems to be a lot more...Laggy? I'm not entirely sure if that's the right word for it, but I notice a difference in timing between what happens on an enemies screen (or the server) and what happens on my screen. I play mostly HC so it's mostly a feeling throughout the game and the only proof I get is I'm the final death of the round. 

What it often feels like while playing is that I peek a corner or run around a corner and I get instantly popped. It feels like I have \~200ms at best to see an enemy and react and by the time I do I'm already dead. But when I watch the kill cam on the final kill of the game or I go play soft core, I see that the server or the enemy or whatever had me on their screen at least a second, second and a half, maybe even two before they even start shooting. 

Now this might sound complainey or whiney, but that's not what I'm trying to do here. If I get outplayed I get out played, fair enough. Bit of latency every now and then is fine as well. But this is something else. This is something I only notice during weekends or evenings. If I boot up MW2 in the mornings or during lunch I don't feel this...lag...for lack of a better word, at all. 

This leads me to believe that this isn't an issue on my end and the scoreboard seems to confirm that, as my ping usually hovers between < 10 and 20ms. I run at \~ 70-80fps range in the game as well and I have no other programs downloading in the background or whatever. And for a spot of context; I'm running a Ryzen 5 2500x, RTX3070, 16GB RAM, on win 10 with a wired connection to a full duplex gigabit fiber connection. I \_shouldn't\_ have any issues on my end.

The only things I can think of is maybe I'm just a bit slow, mentally, at some times during the evening / weekend...I mean...it's an option, I'm going through some shit, but it doesn't \_feel\_ like that's the issue, I feel like there should be a greater variance in how much this happens and it should be less time bound. Or the other thing is that maybe there's some...I don't know...congestion(?) on the servers? The servers being a bit laggy? But then why do my enemies not seem to be bothered by it all that much? 

I have no idea what's causing it, but it's frustrating as heck because it basically stops me from playing when I \_want\_ to play or \_have time\_ to play. I do still play during those times, but I'm not having fun what so ever.

After having played for something in the region of 5 hours over the course of the last week or so I find myself wondering ""how is 2042 still in a state like this, almost a year after launch?"". In those 5 hours I've had about as many crashes to desktop, the Portal search filters still reset every time after you go back to the main menu, TDM is not even an option in the filters anymore, there is still no hardcore game mode available and TDM is still unavailable in the base game. Animations often feel laggy or janky, the weapon and specialist balance is all over the place, the game's menu's and UI are still confusing and illogical as all heck, attempting to join a server that is currently switching maps just gives you a random ass error notice with a UUID and you're just supposed to know that this means ""we can't let you join because we're switching maps, try again in 5 minutes"" and that's not even mentioning the serious lack of content. 

Since last I played, almost a year ago, they've added 2 new maps, something like 5-6 new weapons, of which a decent chunk are old weapons from previous games getting introduced into the base game and like 2 new specialists. And the worst thing? That's just the base game, Portal got no new content as far as I can tell.

DICE, what the heck is going on there? Are you alright? How is this game still *this* buggy after almost a year of dev time? And don't say ""covid has been challenging"", COVID is not the issue here. Everyone's back to work and either in office or WFH and we're all doing fine. That's not an excuse anymore. 

I'm not pissed off or anything, I'm just sad and disappointed. 2042 could've been so frigging awesome and such a wonderful game. But I'm starting to doubt it will ever be that. I don't mind the rocky launch, look at BF4, very rocky launch, but it got fixed over time and content got added and I still play it to this day. It's fantastic, I love that game.

1871,yes,raisedbyborderlines,2022-07-16 21:24:35,bwssoldya,"No mom, just because you're my blood doesn't make you my family","*insert vin diesel here*


Had a BBQ with the parents today, was enjoyable during as we had other friends of the family there as well and mom tends to try her hardest to behave in company, but as soon as they left it of course went to shit :').

I've made a fair few posts in this sub about it previously, but for a spot of context I'll go over the backstory real quick.

At the end of February / beginning of March I caught covid and I ended up getting so sick it triggered an epileptic seizure while I was standing at the top of the stairs, causing me to tumble down. I live by myself and neighbours found me. Got taken away by ambulance to the nearest hospital were I spent 2 days in a coma on the ICU and then woke up again, went home 2 days after that and outside of burnout (had this before the whole ordeal as well) I'm doing fine again. 

Now tonight she kept hammering on about how the police showed up at their doorstep to tell them what had happened and at the time police didn't fully know if I was stable yet, so they told my parents that and my parents were obviously devastated. Doesn't take much of a genius to figure out how that would affect someone.

But they kept hammering on and on and on about it tonight and they kept making it sound like I was at fault for it all. Like yeah of course ma, I 100% purposefully decided to just put myself in a coma for a couple of days so I could have a nice sleep in.

What they ended up saying though is that they are still suffering from this and they still wake up with it some nights. But the blame towards me comes from the fact that I went LC with them shortly after I got home.

Now I went LC because shortly after I had to, of course, process what had happened to me as well and it led me down a rabbit hole of my mental health (which was already terrible) and that's when I found this sub and figured out just how abusive mom's BPD had been over the years and I needed the time to let that sink in, so I went LC.

Apparently though, you're not allowed to do such things. Because we are family and we go through things together and I might not like it that we're family and I might not want to be family anymore but I don't have a choice because I am and if were to even try she'd drag me back into the family by my hair screaming if she had to, she wouldn't allow me to leave the family. Because family sticks together. 

Yeah ma, family does stick together, but family also doesn't abuse each other. Family cares for each other, family doesn't let other family walk on egg shells, family doesn't gaslight each other and lastly, family let's you walk away if you want to.

Just be sure we're blood doesn't mean we're family. We're blood. She can certainly try dragging me back, but I'm going to live my life the way I want to, and that doesn't include abuse. I'm worth more than that.

TW: Mention of rape 

So I guess this is a follow up from [the post I did the other day](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbyborderlines/comments/vv0ly7/i_am_not_borderline/) and besides that...I don't think I even know where to start. Let's go for a quick version and some context first I suppose? 

Been LC for about 4 months (or ever since I found this sub and found out how much trauma mom has caused me), but went shopping with mom on Saturday to our equivalent of Costco. Went to a McDonalds for lunch and ended up telling her about the struggles of getting into therapy for my depression / burnout and trauma and getting a diagnosis for Autism. Mom has been vehemently against me ""putting the label of autism on myself"". Told her on Saturday that I figured out that I am definitely autistic and that I know for sure, but I don't have a diagnosis yet and I do want one just so I can stop the people going ""oh but you self diagnosed and thus it's invalid"". Everything seemed fine and she agreed that it was shitty of people to do that so it made sense. 

Cut to Sunday. She texts me in the morning that I need to look up HSP and that I'm so stuck on being autistic. She basically said: ""You're not autistic, you're HSP"". Thus invalidating my feelings and self-diagnosis, doing exactly what she said was shitty to do. So I told her that I'm stuck on being autistic because I AM autistic. I told her that I might be HSP as well, I don't know, that's something to figure out with a diagnosis, but I'm 100% certain that I'm autistic and HSP would be co-morbid in that case. 

Which got a reply of ""okay go figure it out then good luck. You'll never get rid of labels"". I answered again saying that I don't need to get rid of the autism label because I'm proud to be autistic. It explains a lot of things about me and it means I've finally found a community that I belong in, a community that I understand and a community that understand me. That I no longer have to mask, that I no longer have to be what society tells me to be to and that I can finally get to know myself and learn who I am and just be that. 

And of course the pwBPD can't have the focus being on someone else, so her reply was ""I, of all people, understand what it feels like to want to belong, but I don't have parents that love me, you do, as if you don't belong with us. You've never done anything other than hurt me but I still love you always"". \*insert wut face here\*. But it gets better. A quick follow up comes  in the form of ""Now I'm crying again because of you, as I so often do. But that's okay, we're not good enough anyways. Glad you found a place to call home, hope they're willing to BBQ with you because I don't want to anymore \[editor note: we were planning a bbq on upcoming Saturday\]. Maybe they're also willing to celebrate Christmas with you"". 

Honestly? Celebrating Christmas with people that accept me and don't go fucking ballistic because dad had a breakfast sandwich and now can't eat as much of the overkill turkey dinner that is served for lunch as they were expecting? Yeah that sounds amazing. I'll take that. 

And still it gets better. This morning I got a whole essay at like 6AM. She knows I hate waking up to those, but she keeps doing it anyways. I think it's on purpose. It tends to ruin entire days for me as whatever happens during my waking up period sets the tone of the day for me. I won't translate and post the whole thing because it's like 1.5x the size of this post so far. But I'll TL;DR it. 

She starts off with a good ol' fashioned ""there's so much I want to say to you"" (and oh boy did she). It then goes into a ""no matter what handicap you have, we still love you. We don't care if you're autistic or not"". Well that's a lie. You do. A lot. But it gets better. She says that it's fine that I'm depressed and ""have trauma, as you say"", sorry what? ""as I say""? That sounds an awful lot like doubting if I have trauma. When she knows full well I was bullied in my entire school going life for being different. Not to mention the trauma from growing up with a pwBPD, but we'll get back to that in a bit. 

However that's about the extent of any focus on me or my feelings. The turn is as close to 180 as one can get as she goes ""Why don't you allow us into your life?"" which is followed up by a whole section of ""because you think I have borderline? Well I don't have borderline! I have untreated PTSD, not that you'll believe me, but what I've had happen to me in my life....even therapists wouldn't be able to handle that. I've been beaten, mentally abused and raped."" and she goes on to go into some more detail about how she beaten, abused and raped. She does also manage to find some room in there somewhere to throw out a casual ""Don't you ever call me borderline again, or else..."". 

The last bit of the main part of the message is about me leaving them and not wanting to be with them and throwing them away even though they love me and get ignored. They being intended as ""mom and dad"" but actually meaning ""mom"" in this case (of course). 

The last paragraph starts off with an absolute banger: ""And then I'll tell you something about your trauma"". Oh this'll be good. She basically goes into my accident at the beginning of march where I had an epileptic seizure that landed me in a 2 day coma in the ICU and how they thought they had lost me and how badly that affected them and how they thought they lost me, but then didn't but now they lost me anyways even though I'm still alive and how it hurts her so much. 

That's pretty much the entirety of the last 10 messages in WhatsApp. It's absolutely mental and it's so self-centered. Me saying I found a place I belong in somehow gets translated into ""I don't care about you anymore, go away"". My trauma gets invalidated out the wazoo and arguably the worst of all is the fact that my autism doesn't get accepted. I get a ""we still love you even though..."". But it's not an acceptance of my autism and I take that personal, because it is. Autism \*is\* me. If I weren't autistic I wouldn't be who I am. I would be an entirely different person. So to get this subtle, under the table disdain for wanting the official label for something I already know I am hurts. A lot. 

And of course the trauma invalidation is a big one as well. I still don't know why she thinks that a dick measuring contest about who has the biggest trauma is needed and why her trauma (which I fully accept btw, I know she's had a traumatic life) means my trauma is not valid somehow. One does not exclude the other and yet here I am, left wondering why this person that's supposed to be the adult in this dynamic gets so petty over this. 

I want to respond. I started writing a response, but I'm not sure I like what I have so far. She denies her BPD and in my message I make a big point that she can deny it all she wants, she has the official diagnosis, it was never disproven and she shows all the symptoms (and ""not being able to make appointments and follow through"" is not the symptom that defines BPD mom :/) but I do also mention that if she wants to deny it, then fine, I'll not tell her she has BPD, I'll leave her to whatever feelings she thinks valid, but that it doesn't take away my trauma nor does it invalidate it. 

Ironically, there is so much I want to say, there's so many feelings of sadness, anger and pain swirling around inside, but I can't translate them into the words needed to convey them properly, which is, also ironically, an autistic trait. 

I wish I was already in therapy so I had an emotional / mental support professional to fall back on and help me with all of this. But unfortunately it looks like I'm still a ways away and all of this confrontation is happening a lot earlier than I had planned for. Kinda wishing I didn't tell her about my mental health struggles now. 

Hey. If you made it this far, congrats and thank you for reading the entire post. I hope you're having a bit of a better day than I am currently, but if you're also not doing too great, please just know that no feeling is final, good times are ahead, you will feel better.

So I asked her about her diagnosis and she says ""yes, but it's a bad diagnosis"", which of course explains fully why her tone of voice flipped from happy go lucky to threatening and pissed off in an instant.

She also kept insisting that people with borderline are ""untrustworthy"", they ""keep lying and what not"" and also that ""you can't make any agreements or appointments with them"".

To be honest, now that I know and realize what she is, how she works, how it impacts me and how I can deal with it, I can't help but just be amused by her empty words and denial.

Almost feels like I'm keeping a journal or writing a novel here. Apologies if it's overbearing at all. TL;DR recap: BPD Mom is horrible at finances and now owes me 1500 euro that I asked back and it's been a hell of a ride so far. 

So, after the whole debacle of mom blocking me on WhatsApp after asking her about the money and her unblocking me the next morning and telling me when they were going to the camp site (on the 26th) I kept quiet. I had no energy to deal with her BS and I said nothing. Yesterday (1st of July) she texted me that they were going to the camping grounds again and I kept quiet again. Still wasn't able to deal with it and today (2nd of July) she actually texted me that they're selling the cabin they have on the camp site to the new site owners and that they're going back home, but more importantly she said that I'll be getting my money back, not sure when exactly, she hopes next week, but just so I know. 

Victory! 

Apparently my lack of energy to respond has persuaded them to sell. So I did text her back saying ""okidokey"". 

Now I do have to apply some brakes here because this can definitely be a manipulation tactic to get me to respond. But so far she hasn't responded to my okidokey and she can try to dangle the carrot in front of me with ""it'll be in 2 days"" \*2 days pass\* ""it got moved to wednesday"" \*wednesday rolls around\* ""It's tomorrow"" type of BS. But I came prepped: We'll go right back to the silent treatment until the money is in my account. At the end of the day it's a win-win for me. I don't have to deal with the BS and I get my money back. 

The flipside however would be that if I get the money back she's gonna expect to go back to more contact and generally I'll be fine with that. But I can't deal with BS right now so I'll probably keep LC going for as long as possible.

This will not be the last time any of this type of stuff happens.

Do we think there might be some sort of correlation between ""cat people"" and Autism? 

Now here me out on this. Like any good research study let's set some parameters here. Cats are often labeled as autistic (or at least show autistic traits). Dogs are often not labelled as such. Now the second parameter is people. There seems to be some sort of bias from almost anyone who likes pets towards either cats or towards dogs. Of course people can love both or love other animals too. But if you put a dog and a cat in front of them they tend to bond more with one over the other. 

Now with those parameters set in place, is there any sort of logical conclusion we might be able to take away between people who naturally bond more with cats than dogs (cat people) and being diagnosed as autistic? 

Of course I do realize that one does not exclude the other and there's dog people that are autistic or people who can't deal with either who are autistic, so it's nothing fool proof here, but would it be possible that the percentage of cat loving people who are autistic is statistically significantly higher than dog loving people who are autistic? 

Really nothing more than a dumb shower thought, not trying prove or disprove anything here.

It's kinda nice actually, even though there's nothing she can actually do to help me as she's not trained to deal with ANY of the BS I'm throwing her way (dDPD mom + Burnout + possible autism + possible CPTSD + a whole litany of other things all intertwining). 

Today we had another quick half an hour appointment and while walking I told her about my mom flipping out to me and [blocking me](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbyborderlines/comments/uv8897/bad_financial_decisions/) [on WhatsApp](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbyborderlines/comments/uy397l/bad_financial_decisions_part_2_the_reconnect/) (2 links to earlier posts on RBB with context). But instead of telling her I just handed her my phone and told her to read through it. Her first response was basically ""Oh wow....errmmm"". 

It was a greatly entertaining for me to see her reaction and see what she thought of it. I feel like it took her a solid 10 minutes to process what she had read and eventually she came to the conclusion that going that what I've been doing sounds like it's probably the best way to deal with this (going vLC). She said that because of the amount of other stuff on my plate this was probably my best bet to keep on doing and focus on myself and I'm not gonna lie, it felt great to get some outside validation for the BS that we as RBBers deal with from ""normal"" people. 

That's about all I've got on my side, hope you're all doing well and holding out strong. Life with pwBPD can be awful sometimes but know that some stranger on the internet thinks you're incredibly strong for dealing and managing with it as you turn into a much stronger person you would've otherwise been. Scarred, emotionally damaged and often troubled, but also very strong for surviving through it all. You rock!

So I figured I'd update y'all whenever my mom contacted me again after she blocked me earlier in the week and now is this time. Well technically she had already unblocked me the very next morning but she hasn't said anything since then. Probably didn't know where to pick back up from the last words being ""I'm blocking you"". But I figured that I wasn't going to be the one to start the conversation back up, I'd leave that up to her. Let her go over that difficult bump.

Well this morning is the morning she's managed that and it's short and sweet: ""the car is already fixed and we're going back to the campgrounds so you know"". Nothing too special or surprising really. I'm tempted to send back something along the lines of ""and what about my money? Haven't gotten that back yet have I?"" but I suspect that'll get me another blockage so I'm not sure about that yet.

However what I AM strongly considering is driving over to their house later today and ""breaking in"" (not really breaking in if I have the keys is it) and grabbing my spare house key and car keys back, locking the door behind me and dropping their keys through the mail slot.

That would atleast get me my keys back and get me into a more comfortable position for going NC. Now I do have a slight concern that they might have my house keys on them, in which case it'd be useless, but I dunno, worth a shot perhaps?

Apparently their ""new"" (secondhand) car had some sort of issue with the transmission, some sort of filter was full or w/e and the dealer quoted them 1000 euro, but they couldn't afford that and she went all ""I guess we'll have to sell the car now, see if anyone wants to give any money for it"" blabla guilt trip ""send me money"" stuff. Told them to speak to a family friend who we always bring our cars to, not an official licensed dealer but does repair and sell cars for a living.

Got a text this morning that he can do it much cheaper. Great, problem solved right? Saved money now she can set that aside and pay me back the 1500 euro she owes me. Nope, instead she went ""ya know, I'm gonna buy a TV for in the vacation home and an Amazon firestick and pay for an Amazon UK account so I can watch British iTV. could also do it with an iPhone but we don't have those"".

Excuse my language but WHAT THE FUCK? you can't afford 1000 euro to repair your car, but you can afford a new TV (sure couple hundred euros would suffice, but still), buy a fire stick (80 euro ish?) and a prime sub (which we already have btw, just not for the UK site) and then you still can't watch iTV because THAT'S NOT HOW THAT WORKS!

I've told her before I'm working on setting something up, but it's taking a while due to my mental health and reliance on a third party that's not hurrying up. But she keeps ignoring it and instead of paying me back my 1500 euro that I'm gonna be needing soon to buy a garden, she wants to buy stuff for their vacation home.

Oh and as I type this I get spammed back messages, firstly her telling me that that _is_ how it works (it doesn't, I'm in IT, I like to think I know more about IT as a professional than she does). And it's followed by:

""Yeah alright""
""Great""
""Lovely""
""How often have I asked you to pay me back something? It's already stressful enough. You're such a twat, fuck off, I have enough stress without you, stupid kid""
""don't want to hear you again""
""I'm gonna block you""

And she's now blocked me. Guess that's my NC sorted then. And I'm guessing I can say goodbye to that 1500 euro.

Well I say that but in 2 days time at most she'll have unblocked me and she'll be talking to me again.

1879,yes,AutisticAdults,2022-05-18 09:51:42,bwssoldya,Losing special interests?,"Hi all,

I have a bit of a question for those who have lived the bigger part of their life undiagnosed. No idea if this is something normal or if this is something that'll go away or what ever. 

I've been an avid gamer since the age of 7 and am now 30. As a wee-gamer an during my teen years I was absolutely obsessed with gaming, to the point of missing toilet breaks, not drinking enough, the whole 9 yards. In hindsight this was of course a special interest. 

To this day I still love gaming and games. I still keep up with the news on a daily basis and I get incredibly hyped for the big gaming summer press-conferences every year. But what I've noticed is that gaming it self just doesn't give me the same...I dunno, obsession?...that it used to. It's like I can no longer lose myself in playing games and enjoying them and I'm not 100% sure why that is. I do have a few theories though:

I suspect one of the bigger reasons is the constant complaining from my mom that I spend too much time behind the PC playing video games and I should do something useful with my life. This started somewhere during my teens. I've managed to mostly ignore it, but the older I get and the more she keeps saying it the less time I spend behind the PC or the less time I spend gaming. It almost feels like my mom bullied me out of one of my special interests. 

Other explanations are that it might be something natural. It just happens that over time you lose interest in your special interest. Though I find that a bit hard to believe with how autism and it's special interests seem to work. ""life gets in the way"" is the other explanation I can picture being a part of the reason. As an adult there's more responsibilities on you like taking care of your house, caring for pets and / or kids (latter n/a in this particular case), etc. Ya know, ""adult things"". 

If I think through that last explanation though, I end up coming to the conclusion that that would mean that my masking killed my special interest and that would be pretty much the same thing as the first reason I mentioned. It'd mean that to appease NT's I've ruined a special interest for myself. That makes me incredibly sad and furious. 

It also has the side effect of feeling like my current horrible mental state might be stemming from the fact I can't execute my special interest, or at least not without a constant voice in the back of my head going ""you're a 30 year old that is playing games during the weekend? You have a house to maintain and clean. Go clean your house, go do something useful with your life"". 

My horrible mental state is the fourth and final potential reason I can think of for gaming less and less. Currently undiagnosed, but I know for a fact I have severe trauma from bullying as a child and recently I came to the realization that my mom, with her Borderline Personality Disorder is probably responsible for more severe trauma to a point where I'm showing symptoms of cPTSD and I estimate there's a good chance of getting that diagnosis once I do get into therapy (a waiting game atm). 

Is this loss of a special interest something any of you can relate to? Have you ""lost"" a special interest due to societal pressure? If so, can it come back fully or will it never be the same? Is there any explanation I might've overlooked? What are your opinions on the reasons I gave? 

Sorry if that's a lot, don't mean to overwhelm anyone, but I'm just freestyling this and typing as it comes out and apparently it comes out in a quite overwhelming fashion. Thank you if you made it this far in the post. Just wanted to mention that no matter what you're going through, you're still a person and you are worthy of being loved and cared for.",30,18,18,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='us98or')>,,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/us98or/losing_special_interests/,False
1880,yes,raisedbyborderlines,2022-05-11 15:48:56,bwssoldya,Apparently I'm not allowed to point out mom's manipulations,"*UPDATED, see bottom of the post*

So, bit of a story here, but I'll condense it down for you.

This happened this afternoon. I was in the backseat of my parents' car and they were driving me home. We're almost there and mom goes ""so, you want us to drop you off, or do you want to talk about it all"" (""it all"" being my epilepsy diagnosis we just got back from). But she says it in a way where you can't help but feel like the only ""correct answer"" is the second option.

So my response is ""no, what you're actually asking is 'can we come inside and talk about it all because I'm wanting to talk about it'."" and she instantly blew up at me 😂. Was actually entertaining to watch (given we were literally around the corner from my house so I wasn't gonna get any long lasting rants). She flipped out and started shouting ""don't you put words in my mouth! I didn't say that, this is about you!"". Ended up rolling my eyes and said ""well in that case I'm good"". Wasn't about to be subject to more of this b/s than that.

If she can't even respond back to me in a normal tone of voice at a normal speaking volume, then I'm all good....well, that makes it sound like I'm not good about my diagnosis, but I am so the answer would've been the same either way.

Anyways, tl;dr: pwBPD can't handle being faced with their manipulative behaviors. Who knew.

Also just to quickly go over it in case anyone is left wondering. Had an epileptic seizure couple of months ago, probably caused by covid. Had MRI and EEG done and we just got the news that it was in fact epilepsy, but that the scans all look good and we're hoping it won't happen again.

UPDATE: so it's the next day and I've been expecting a message from mom about yesterday and her getting her need to talk in anyways and sure enough, 9:30am I get a whatsapp 😂. So predictable.

And of course the contents are just as predictable. TL;DR: ""how are you after yesterday, did the doctor say anything that scared you? Anyways about me. *the other 95% of the message is about how she feels and what she thinks about whether or not I should be taking anti epilepsy medication*""

1881,yes,AutisticAdults,2022-05-08 10:37:15,bwssoldya,Special interests,"Hey y'all,

Apologies if this has been asked before and apologies if this would've been better in the introduction thread (chose a seperate post because it's more of a specific topic). 

Not officially diagnosed (yet) but I'm sure I'm autistic, just have to wait until I can get into therapy and get to do the tests.

So my question is about special interests. The more I read the more I'm not sure about special interests. I do have interests that have been with me for decades now like anything IT related and stuff like gaming, but my other interests that I end up hyper focusing on tend to be things that I hyper focus on for a small period of time and it recurs every year. So for example, in November / December / January I'll absolutely binge and be obsessed with TV shows and movies, but then it fades away and then come January, March I might return into Minecraft for example or I'll get obsessed with 3d printing and it'll last for a month, two, maybe three at most. Then I'll be fed up with them and I'll not touch it for a year when I get some sort of trigger again and I end up obsessing over it again for a few months. 

Are those still special interests? Is that normal on autism? Or is this more along the lines of how NT's work? Reading and watching and listening to a lot of stuff about special interests I hear a lot about people being obsessed with things for much much longer than I tend to be. Hence my insecurity.

I have a feeling my obsessions might be that short because I have a job and a lot of other obligations that get in the way of my obsessions. Or perhaps it's an obsession I just can't do anything with right then and there (woodworking obsession and wanting to get into it but not having wood to work on for example)

1882,yes,raisedbyborderlines,2022-05-05 06:02:26,bwssoldya,money trouble.. again,"First off, apologies ladies, gents and otherwise defined genders, for this is going to be a long one. But I need to vent and get it out before I respond to my dBPD mom because I doubt this'll be fine otherwise. Also, this post is about issues dealing with finances, I'm personally very open and honest about finances and I know that not everyone likes that, so this is your forewarning that I will discuss finances and I will be using fairly specific numbers in this post. And another big warning is that I am currently fairly angry and I tend to cuss a lot when I'm angry so there might be some swear words here and there. Apologies to the mods, if there's boundaries there that I've crossed please reach out, I'd be happy to rectify the post. That should cover the warnings ahead of time now time. 

My dBPD mom is the person in their household who does the money and she's absolutely godawful at it. She knows how to do it, her advice is actually relatively good, but she straight up just doesn't follow it. As long as I can remember we've been in some form of financial trouble. She's a stay at home mom by choice (more like unemployable because she can ""never work under a boss"" and hold a job longer than 2 weeks is more like it but I digress). My dad is now retired but used to work as fork lift mechanic. Not the greatest pay but should be able to keep a family of 3 people and a few pets sorted out. However due to the poor management of the finances we were always struggling for money and have been fairly close to the brink of bankruptcy.

These financial troubles of course mean that monkey see, monkey do and adult me sucks with money as well , but having been on the brink of bankruptcy myself and just barely being able to escape it and get back on track and having had a lucky break last year I've come to be very aware of just how bad financial stress feels and I've vowed ""never again"".

Now my parents had a lucky break as well last year. See, my fathers sister is a very wealthy woman (through marriage) with millions and millions in the bank and being well off like she is, she's also very stingy with her money (absolutely her right not hating, just painting a picture) and she's getting older (in her 70's) and she's been trying to distribute her wealth among family last year. She'd rather give with a warm hand than a dead one (her words). So she's been gifting all my dad's siblings a bunch of money. In total over the past year my parents received 160,000 euro from her. For a spot of context, they live in a house that is mortgaged for that amount of money.

Now this was in 4 installments, 3x 50k and in January another 10k. My mom has managed to burn through 160k euro in a year's time to remodel the house (ie: start like 5 remodeling projects and not finish them because of course contractors are too expensive, gotta do it all on our own) leaving them with a new wood laminated floor (they also bought ceramic tiles to redo the floor, but those live in the new outside shed that's barely water tight and missing doors) they added a glass room to the back of the house that leaks, gets way too warm in the summer because it doesn't have shades, leaks, etc, had new stairs put into the house that are now destroyed by a cheap ass contractor literally dragging a window up them for double glazing upstairs, etc etc etc. You get the point. Individually all of this sounds great, but each and every single one of those projects was done half baked and there's a few I haven't even mentioned yet.

Now all that in mind, they've run out of money again. They have a chalet on a holiday resort Park type deal they are trying to sell but no one wants it. Now what does a good BPD mother do when she had no money and keeps mishandling her money? She asks her son of course! Nevermind that he's going through severe mental health struggles and is dealing with a lot right now. Let's just pile on more shit that is not inheritly his problem! Yay!

I mentioned that I too got lucky last year financially speaking. It's a whole situation but suffice to say I got a new house and took out a new mortgage that left me with 55k to spend on interior (excluding bathroom, kitchen etc) and stuff like garden. I've bought a lot, a full new interior and splurged on a lot. Leaving me with around 7k in the bank account and another 800-1200 euro in crypto (depending on the day). This 7 grand is planned for the driveway and garden remodel. I'm not sure how expensive it is going to be, still awaiting the a quote. Mom knows this. And last month she already asked me for a 1000 euro. Now they've helped me out in the past as well (always accompanied with angry 'get your finances straight' rants etc which is fair) so I gave her the 1000 euro. And in early January she had already asked for 3 grand and she's paid that back when she got the other donation from my aunt. All well and good. But this morning she's asked me for another 500 euro.

This leaves me with around 5k on the account (had some other big medical bills come in as well) and I'm still not sure what the garden is gonna cost, but I bet it's more than 5k.

Either way I'm willing to give it to her but it's the way she asks. And the fact that she asks in the first place tbh. From what I've heard it's not normal for parents to ask their children for financial support. But what pisses me off about it is the way she asks. She does this thing where she texts me at like 5am when I'm still asleep (she is always up waay early) and thus what happens is that I wake up and first thing I see is a text asking for money, sending my undiagnosed autistic brain into a frenzy and effectively ruining my day because I get mad and that's what my brain does.

And she does this every. Single. Time. And it pisses me off like you wouldn't believe. But oh boy, if I even dare to get remotely pissy at her for miss managing 160,000 euro or giving her a speech about how she needs to get better with her money or even how it ruins my day that she asks. I'm gonna get the full brunt of BPD. Screaming, shouting, guilt tripping, gaslighting, you name it.

I've not transferred the money yet and I haven't responded yet, because I wanted to get this off my chest first. It's helped calm me down a little bit, but it still gets me fuming and you can bet that this day is gonna be a shit one for me.

I'm sorry for the incredibly long post, but I thank you for having this place that I feel safe enough to post this tirade. It means a lot to be able to vent.

I do hope your day is better and whatever you are dealing with, remember that no feeling is final and a day will come where the sun once again shines bright.

1883,yes,raisedbyborderlines,2022-05-03 16:28:15,bwssoldya,Trauma bonding,"So in a post in here earlier today by someone else someone linked a video to Dr. Ramani about Trauma Bonding. Being curious as I am and not knowing what that was I ended up watching it, fantastic watch, thank you for linking the video (apologies, I forgot who it was) ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmB9fpHVd2o) for reference)

It's sent me on a bit of a rollercoaster, not necessarily about my self. I do recognize trauma bonding in there and I do recognize that the last relationship I was in was with a pwBPD and it was based on trauma bonding (now that I know what it is) and I realized I saw some friends go through the same thing as well. 

But no, my main concern in this is my dad. I do recognize some of the signs in his behaviour going back a few years and it's made me a bit sad to be honest. Mostly due to the fact that he's 69 now, getting up there in age and the only way he'd ever get out is by going into therapy. Being Dutch, from a farmer family and born in the 50's he's too stubborn to even remotely consider it so I doubt it'll ever happen, which is what makes me sad. The thought of having to eventually lose my dad (which is something I do struggle with, but putting that aside) and him having not had the same....I want to say chance, but he has had the chance...but therapy and stuff was different back when he had the chance I'd say....either way, inner dilemma aside, it pains me that he's going to have to probably spend the rest of his life enduring this abuse (or in the very rare case of him escaping, being alone) and not ever being able to find out what healthy relationships look like. It's such a sad thought. And yeah, I know, don't ever assume things (ass out of u and me, and all that) and I'm not saying there's 0 chance. But I think odds are better of him winning the lottery than him seeking out therapy, so.... 

However, mentioning therapy also brings up a very recent memory of mine that I've been struggling a bit with. Something my mom said recently. Before I get into that though, a spot of context is needed. 

At the beginning of March (2nd) I was very ill and I ended up tumbling down the stairs with a seizure (temp diagnosis is Epilepsy, still awaiting results if it actually is or not) and ended up being found by my neighbours and being rushed to the hospital where I was also found to have COVID (I'm 30yo male with obesity and a history of various lung problems among which bronchitis and asthma, all that being a very bad combo). Ended up in a coma the ICU for a solid day and 2 days after was declared healthy enough to be released back home. This however triggered a whole thing about possible mental trauma for having gone through all of that suddenly. Both from my parents but also from my GP. He recommended I go see a psychiatrist (got the referral yesterday) and possibly even undergo EMDR therapy depending on how bad it gets. 

Here's the bit you're here for:  
However, I also told my parents that I think they should undergo therapy as well due to this not only being a (potential) traumatic experience for me, but also for them. The response I got from mom however is what has puzzled me ever since and I think Dr. Ramani might've just helped me figure this out. Her exact words were ""No, we're not going to therapy. If we go to therapy my marriage is over"". 

Up until now I haven't been able to place why this was exactly. Yeah they have fallouts (geez who would've guess there'd be loads of arguments in a household with BPD?) etc and their marriage has been rocky ever since ""the flat incident"" (more about this later) so I get it from that point, but I couldn't figure out why therapy would be the bit to break that relationship up. But it's not therapy it self that would do it, it's specifically my dad going into therapy that would push him into realizing what was going on and then yeah I can definitely see the marriage break up. That makes sense now. So, again, to the person who posted that link, thank you! 

So quickly about ""the flat incident"". Back when we lived in a flat for a while (talking like \~15 years ago now?), mom fell in love with the superintendent of the flat and they were gonna be together and she'd divorce dad and the intendent would divorce his wife, etc. And yes, their were pretty much cheating on their partners because they were already in a sort of relationship together while still being with their partners. This might well be the most traumatic event I've been through that I can recall and I can't really think about it all that much without becoming overwhelmed with all the emotions and I can't place them. They ended up reconciling with their partners at the behest of the superintendent's partner and mom and dad stayed together but we moved out of the flat a while later, so I don't know what happened to the superintendent. Either way, mom and dad's marriage has never been the same since and it feels like the BPD and it's effects have grown worse over time as a result. 

Also, that flat incident is where I'm getting my main confirmation for ""dad is involved with trauma bonding"" from. During that whole incident both parents used me as their defacto therapist and oh boy, lemme tell ya. Seeing your dad literally bawl his eyes out uncontrollably in front of you does something to your soul. But the main bit that sticks out is that even though ALL of that was going on, I vividly remember him shouting about my mom to me. I don't remember the exact words but it boiled down to something along the lines of ""she's the one for me, she's the love of my life, If I can't have her my life is useless and I might as well end it then"" (perhaps not entirely that suicidal, but it wasn't far off). Thinking back on that, it definitely matches what Dr. Ramani talked about in that video. 

Sorry for the long rant. This just triggered something and I felt like posting it. If you've read this far, thank you, I appreciate you and whatever you're going through, know there's going to be a better tomorrow. The sun will rise again, it's science, they proved it, and life will go on, so take a deep breath and keep on keeping on.

So the fun fact; I very much doubt this was done on purpose, seeing as mom hadn't had the diagnosis yet, but my parents named me after Bryan Adams and Patrick Swayze. This makes it so that my initials spell out B.P.D. Does that make me now no longer welcome here? 😛

Either way, here's a picture of Echo when he was real smoll babbie cat. Back when he was still behaved 😂

1885,yes,raisedbyborderlines,2022-04-28 10:31:43,bwssoldya,Contact is hard after the initial realization,"Hey Y'all, 

So, having realized just Tuesday that being RBB has a serious mental impact and is a *big* part of being as mentally scuffed as I am, I've now ended up in a situation that I find myself struggling with. 

I've not told anyone (except my social worker) about the situation and I plan to keep it that way. People around me know I've had a bit of a mental breakdown Tuesday and I've told them I'd explain more once I finally get connected with a psychiatrist (which is taking longer than I had hoped). 

I feel this need to talk about this sort of thing over with the psychiatrist first because even though the feelings and realization are there, I feel like I need some validation from a professional about the situation and for them to tell me that ""yes, you are right, your issues do seem to stem from mental abuse from a pwBPD"" before I go around telling the people around me. If I don't it feels like I'll be drawing conclusions without an actual basis for it somehow. 

However, internally I am already feeling like the flood gates have cracked and slowly but surely stuff is seeping out, among which is the standard blame towards my mom. I know those feelings are valid (if I am right about the abuse) and I'm allowed to feel them, but here's the issue: I'm still in contact with my parents and the contact has always been fairly regularly. Some weeks we barely talk but most weeks it's atleast a few whatsapp message per day back and forth. But feeling this blame and this resentment makes this contact *extremely* difficult. 

Out of all the people to tell about this, my parents are probably last on the list (because of obvious reasons). But I think the psychiatrist might be weeks if not a few months away (waiting lists etc) and I'm not sure I can hold back the floods that long, let alone mask those feelings of resentment and blame. 

Is there any advice you guys, gals and others might have that will make it easier to keep up appearances while I await the psychiatrist? 

Thank you in advance. 

P.S. Also have another kitty pic just because

1886,yes,raisedbyborderlines,2022-04-26 14:00:17,bwssoldya,quick introduction and some questions about being RBB,"Hey y'all,

Just found this community today and you made me realize that I am RBB as well. I was so oblivious to it all that I never knew. So, thank you all so much for giving me such an epiphany.

Wanted to give a quick intro about me and my situation and had some questions after the wild mental and emotional morning I've had today.

So real quick, 30M over in Europe, grew up with a diagnosed BPD mother (of the ""witch"" type) and a father that also couldn't (and still can't) handle it. I'm not sure if he's an enabler or not, I've not had the time to analyse this yet.

Currently looking into this sort of thing due to recently falling down the stairs with a seizure and waking up in the ICU (currently still awaiting tests for more info) and due to the fact that this was such a traumatic event I'm currently seeing a social worker whilst I await my doctor's forward to a psychiatrist for (EMDR) therapy. Poking and prodding into my mental state (which, as you've all also experienced is v. bad) led me down the rabbit hole and eventually (via another community on reddit) I ended up here.

So, enough about me, I mentioned I had some questions, would appreciate it greatly if I could take up some more of your time and ask these (and hopefully get an answer?). The initial questions that spring to mind are:

1. How can I recognize who is enabling my mother, other than people's acting like flying monkies or confronting them with the diagnosis? Is there a way to find out what the enablement looks like without letting anyone know I'm looking into this sort of thing? I really don't want to do a confrontation or anything yet until I am in therapy and I know I'll have a stable net to fall back onto when stuff eventually blows up.

2. I've always held a believe of me being on the spectrum for Autistic and as a part of my request for therapy and this journey of uncovering the mountains of bad mental issues, I've requested an official test for a diagnosis of ASD, that being said I've also been diving into ASD and out of all the points in DSM5 that are associated with ASD I'm checking a good 80% I feel like, so I'm almost certain I'm somewhere on the spectrum atleast. Now my actual question is not a diagnosis or anything, but I'm curious to know if there are any others in here that have ASD (diagnosed or undiagnosed) that have gone through RBB and if they'd be willing to share some of their experiences. 

3. I see a lot of talk about LC and NC situations. I get that removing oneself from the situation is definitely a solution, but is there some sort of solution whereby there is still a lot of contact, but where it's more manageable as you're not in _constant_ contact? Given that one of the main issues in BPD is abandonment issues, wouldn't NC or LC be the worst thing imaginable for the BPD person and only help to trigger more issues towards you? And for me personally, I do love my parents and even though I'm now starting to see how growing up with them messed me up worse than I thought, I don't really want to lose contact with them and I don't really want to hurt them. 
	
Like I said, new here and don't want to mess anything up, so please do let me know if this post isn't appropriate or anything. If it's really bad I'd be more than happy to delete it and compensate with some cute cat pictures.

Thank you all so much for being here and creating this community. It's helped me open my eyes and I now know what a great starting point for therapy would be.

Thank you.

Hey y'all,

Just started my journey into the halo books, currently deep into the fall of reach and reading through the part right after >!they get their MJOLNIR armour, specifically where Linda and John have to leave Samuel behind!< left me wondering something and I'm curious to pick your brains about it. 

Would Spartan II's ever be able to love? And I don't mean the Spartan's like Fahjad who had to drop out after the augments, I mean the Spartans like John, Kelly, Linda, etc, the ones that actually saw active combat and lived to tell the tale. 

I know the Thyroid implant in their  augment suppresses sexual drive, so I doubt there'd be much HoloFlix & chill going on with any of them, but from a romantic perspective, or heck even a non-romantic perspective, would they be able to love? Given all they were ever taught was friend and foe, I wonder if they would ever be able to love. Side note, I also don't mean ""love"" in the way the Spartan II's all share their special family-esque connection, I mean outside of the Spartan II's. 

And extending out from loving, do we think the Spartans would ever be able to just...live...outside of active service as a civvie? Looking at our real life situation, you're already seeing soldiers who have seen long active duty and deployments seriously struggle with reintegration into society and that's young adults voluntarily signing up for service. I can't imagine how difficult it'd be for a Spartan II.

How are we missing the most base gamemodes like TDM and FFA? What about hardcore mode? I know all of this can be accomplished in Portal, but the availability of servers in Portal varies wildly and even if there's a bunch of servers with these game modes, there's still the issue of the custom rulesets being applied to the experience. It's cool that we can do custom rulesets but that's not what I want to play. I want to play traditional Hardcore TDM and I want to know what I'm getting into. I want to know if I'm gonna be able to kill team mates or not, I want to know if I'm gonna have a HUD or not, I want to know if I'm gonna be killed for killing a teammate or not and most importantly, I want to know that I'm gonna be playing the same experience over and over again...against people. 

I get it, Conquest (and now breakthrough) have been **the** battlefield gamemodes since the inception of the series. I get it. But not everyone likes dealing with vehicles or big ass maps all the time. Or perhaps, in the case of air superiority, we specifically *want* to deal with vehicles all the time and not worry about capping objectives. How is it that we can get a whole ton of gamemodes in BF4, some of which are literally already in Portal as well (TDM, FFA) but not get them in the new main 2042  game? 

Give us more options DICE. Even if it's just TDM and FFA for now. I doubt it'll be hard for you to create a TDM and FFA mode for AOW seeing as they are already working in the game. Hardcore for all the AOW modes should be a matter of settings, the same settings we control in portal mind you. And for the other gamemodes like gunmaster, air superiority, domination, ctf, etc. I'd understand if they are a bit more work to implement, that's alright. But that doesn't mean they don't need to be added. I'd be fine if they were added at the beginning of next year. But AOW versions of TDM, FFA and Hardcore should not be that hard to implement given they are already in the game.

**Details**

Top 3 rules set the variables we want to use.  
\- *global* **iSniperLimit** \- *int - default: 5* \- The maximum number of snipers per team  
\- *global* **aSniperWeaponList** \- *array* \-  A list of weapons that are considered ""snipers""   
\- *team* **iSniperCount** \- *int - default: 0* \- The current amount of snipers per team   
\- *player* **bIsSniper** \- *bool - default: false* \- If the current player is a sniper   


Last rule is where the magic happens. It will check on player  deploy if the the player is carrying one of the weapons listed in the *aSniperWeaponList* variable. If they are it'll check if the player is marked as a sniper. If not it will check if the sniper limit has been reached. If it is, the player gets killed and a message gets shown. If the sniper limit has not been reached the player will be marked as a sniper and the current sniper count for that team will be upped by 1. If the player is already marked as a sniper nothing happens. If however the player spawns without a sniper rifle and the player is currently marked as a sniper it will remove the mark from the player and it will decrease the team's sniper count by 1.

1890,yes,battlefield2042,2021-11-10 17:10:00,bwssoldya,Recreated my favorite BF4 server in BC2 Portal (+ small tutorial on the logic editor + tips),"Just wanted to share my first creation in the portal editor. Very quick sort of recreation / homage to one of my favorite BF4 servers at the moment.

[https://review.portal.battlefield.com/experience/rules?playgroundId=44e5c140-4244-11ec-aae1-7b50c6ace776](https://review.portal.battlefield.com/experience/rules?playgroundId=44e5c140-4244-11ec-aae1-7b50c6ace776)

&#x200B;

It's Hardcore Team Deathmatch with BC2 classes on BC2 and BC3 maps with custom logic for a sniper limit. I believe this *should* technically work.....but...hard to test.

So onto the tutorial + tips on the logic editor.

First off the order of things. *Step 1:* You begin with a rule. A rule is basically telling the game when stuff needs to happen. By default it's set to ""Ongoing"" and ""Global"". This means this rule is always doing stuff and it's for everyone.

*Step 2:* Conditions A condition is optional. If you specify it you are telling the rule ""hey, only do the things I tell you IF (or when) this condition is met. Example: ""Only run the actions of this rule if a player spawns with this weapon in their inventory"".

*Step 3:* Actions This is the meat and bones of it all. This is where you do most of the work. There's a lot you can do here, from displaying messages to killing players to....well, whatever really. There's too much to cover, might make some tutorials if people want it?

Next up: Symbology. There's a fair few icons used and imho there's no real documentation on what does what. I've figured a few out so far, I'll list them below. Side note; if a field has multiple icons it means it will accept any of those types.

* A person: A player
* Multiple people: A team ID (note; Not sure if it's just the ID, but I imagine so)
* Two arrows going opposite directions: A boolean (true/false, yes/no, etc)
* Question mark: Null (note; still not sure what all goes in here. I've found that it will accept variables, but the rest I'm still not sure on)
* Infinity symbol: Much like my love live, this will take pretty much anything it can get
* Two opposing square brackets: An array (a list of values, ie; \[""apple"", ""pear"", ""orange""\])
* 123: A number, big surprise
* A rectangle with rounded corners (a USB-C plug?) : Some sort of specific green element. Only really saw this in the message thing and there you can add a CustomMessageSlot.

Hope this helps some of you out a bit. If you found more stuff please let me know, I'm eager to dive into this stuff some more.

1891,yes,Advice,2021-01-19 10:06:47,bwssoldya,Struggling with selfishness versus being there for others,"Hey r/Advice,

I have been dealing with an internal struggle on and off for the past little while already and today it seems to have gotten to a point where I'm ready to ask some advice on the matter. It is the struggle between being a good friend and selfishness.

I have felt like a selfish person (in the bad way) for a while now, dealing with my problems, talking about myself a lot (this issue is here while writing this as well) and laying focus on myself. I've really taken notice of it this last year and I've decided I don't like being selfish. I want to be less selfish and focus more on the people around me. I want to hear them out, I want to help them with their struggles and I want them to be in a place where they enjoy being.

This however goes against the other side of me, the side of me that is hurting, that is in pain and that has helped me survive for the past like 5 years. I have no official diagnosis, but I'm pretty sure I am suffering of some form of depression, given how lazy I have gotten and how I beat myself up, both emotionally and in some ways physically as well (with junk food, taking care of my body etc).

Now that you know the two sides that are at play, I'd love like to explain the situation and go through some of the internal debate that rages within me. A good friend of mine is going through a tough spell in life. They have just broken up with their SO last week and yesterday they had some news that causes them to think their job might not be as secure as they had previously thought.

Over the course of this last week I've been talking to them about their breakup and I've kept on tell them I'm there for them and they need to reach out if they want my help and I've offered to hang out in voice chat with them when they're lonely in the mornings etc, been DMing with them on an almost daily basis to talk them through the rough patches and basically offering my support, trying to tell them everything will be alright and things will be better in the future. This has been going on for a week now and I totally get they are feeling down and in the dumps and life is taking a shit on them right now and I've been there and I know you have too.

However, since yesterday morning I've felt actually fairly happy since a while. Even though there's plenty of nasty dark clouds drifting over towards me as well, but I've not really had a break in the grey clouds that have been the day-to-day of my internal thoughts over the past 5 or so years, so to finally have a glimpse of a blue sky and some sunshine really gave me a good boost.

Today however, with my friend taking a few steps back down their emotional state where they were just last week as well, I am having a serious discussion on both sides of my being. On the one hand I want to be a good friend for them and be there for them,  I want to offer my support to them, I want to reach out to them and do .... I don't actually know what to do, I have no idea what to say or do to help them out, I know the feeling is shit and I've not really conquered it myself, so I don't know what other advice I can give besides ""hey things will be alright"". But I want to be there for them, I want them to not feel as shit as I have, or maybe improve it somehow. On the other hand, that would probably require more voice chat's as well, but I personally don't really enjoy the voice chats that much and on top of that, I'm feeling fairly alright today and yesterday and I don't want to go back to that place myself either, it's been a while since I left that place.

The thing is, this friend hasn't reached out to me today and from where I'm standing, I don't think it likely they will. They haven't asked me to hop into voice, they haven't asked me to DM them asking them to go into more detail on what they are feeling and they haven't asked for my support and part of me is going ""I really don't want to reach out to them again. It's all I've done for the past week or so and I've set aside my dislike for voice chats etc. to be there for them, I've offered to watch their favorite TV show with them, etc., all for them. I myself am feeling quite alright generally speaking and I don't want their 'negativity' (big word, I know they can't help it, but at the end of the day it is negativity) to ruin my day too. My past years have been bad enough by themselves. Let them reach out to me and maybe I'll consider responding, but maybe also not because of the last reason"".

On the other side however, I have this part of me going ""Dude. You offered to be their friend, you have on multiple occasions told them you want to be there for them and you want to help them. You have also decided that you want to try to not be as selfish as you have been and still are and it takes a lot of effort to be selfless, but c'mon, you made promises and you genuinely also want to be there for this person and you can't even be selfless for that. How can you call yourself a good friend if you can't even put your own feelings aside for a friend going through a deep deep valley in their life?""

Which gets answered with a ""yeah, and where was this friend when I was going through these deep valleys huh? Where were they for me?"", which sounds an awful lot like Ego, I do realize that.

To which the other side responds with ""What don't you understand about being selfless? The whole point is that you do it and not expect anything in return. Just because they weren't there for you doesn't mean you can't be there for them. Also you didn't reach out to them either, much like they are not reaching out to you right now and you know how shitty you felt. Maybe instead of letting them go through the same thing you went through you can reach out and they'll have a much easier time than you still have"".

**Question**  
So here finally I have the question for all of you: How do you deal with this sort of internal struggle? How do I make the right choice? Both for my friend and for me if at all possible? This struggle between selfishness (and Ego is on that team here and there as well) and between caring for others is a tough one and I don't know how to make this call, I need some help and I could ask my mother, but it feels like she is biased and I won't be getting the answer on *how* to deal with this and more on what to do in the situation, which doesn't help for any future similar situations.

Any advice or help would be much appreciated and even if you don't want to comment or plan to comment, thank you for reading through it all, it's been a long read and I appreciate it. I hope your day is going well and either way, I hope it only gets better for you.

1893,yes,PathOfExileBuilds,2017-05-15 23:55:39,bwssoldya,[Noob] Confused noob looking for able pro,"Hey /r/pathofexile! 

First off I want to apologize if this is not posted in the correct sub or if I do anything else incorrectly, new to the sub and pretty new to reddit in general, so sorry! 


Alrighty now that I have that out of the way, I, as a new player in Path of Exile have a few questions. I've been looking at PoE for a week or 2 now and playing for a week or so. I've mostly been looking at a few of the bigger YouTubers and their guides on things. I think I've got a fairly rudimentary grasp on most things and I think I sort of maybe know a little bit of what I might be doing, however there's still a lot I don't quite get. 


Now that brings us to reddit and I was hoping that, since there's quite an alive community of PoE-ers here on reddit that you might be able to guide a skrub towards gitting gud. 


So to give you an idea of what I'm playing on: My first character (tried to find a way to link him but I can't find anything on the PoE site?) is a level 57 Shadow in softcore legacy league with the following [passive tree](https://www.pathofexile.com/fullscreen-passive-skill-tree/AAAABAYAAQPuBx4I9A18DdEOSA-rES8Rlha_FvMdviBuIvQkiyY8JpUnqSj6KjgrCi-dM4c2PT1fSVFJsUyzUDBSU1fJXfJh4mNDaoxsC2yMbRltbH_GgseEb5MnlS6XlZf0naqi2bDYtAy1SLzqvorAVMM6yBTK08u91ELXz9te44Tmgeq662PviPDV9W_5N_no). Now this passive tree might seem familiar as I'm basically following the [blade vortex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOwXnAW9NFk) build by LiftingNerd. 


The first thing I'd like your opinion on is whether or not I made a boo-boo in going for a way too complicated build as a complete noob.


In the beginning I absolutely blew through normal and even the first few bits of cruel were no problem at all. Even cruel dominus (phase 2) had no idea what was coming to him (Although phase 1 managed to defeat the might BV at least 3 times thanks to those pesky lightning ghosts >_>). Now however I find myself in Act 4 cruel and I'm just keep on dying. The stronger rare mobs and bosses and basically anything that has anything close to resembling a charge or multiple charges will 1 or 2 shot me. 


My character, with his gear at the moment has 1578 life, 1448 es and a grand total of 71 armor. Resists are 22/17/29 (f/c/l) and chaos res is a sturdy -20%. I know I should probably work on those resists but I just can't seem to find any gear that does the resists well and keeps up plenty of ES so I won't instantly die to literally everything. 


That leads me perfectly into my second question: What can I do at this point in time to...well..fix? my character and not get absolutely melted at Malachi and his minions? 


You can find my current set up [here](http://poe-profile.info/profile/bwssoldya/_bws_Celius). I'd love to hear you guys's thoughts on what I could do to improve my current situation. 


My last question (for now anyways, no promises about the future :P) is: I notice my character often times seems to get...stuck...like he'll just plain refuse to move and especially when casting BV it'll take like half a second after casting for him to start moving which often doesn't help against bosses. Would those be stuns or something else preventing me from moving? (Happens on dried lake and I don't think it's a freeze)


Again my apologies if this sort of thing isn't appropriate here, as I said I'm new to the reddit / POE thing and I don't really know if these things are okay or not (can't find it in the rules). 


Thank you in advance to anyone willing to give me some pointers and helping a skrub git...well better for now.

When I do something to recharge some energy however, like go for a walk in a park or partake in my interests (primarily PC gaming), I actually will gain some ambient anxiety to feed off my newly gained energy even when otherwise completely comfortable. For example I was playing a game much of today and felt fine, but as soon as I logged out, I was hit my immediate low grade anxiety, which has been sticking with me ever since.

My guesses as to what might be causing this is:

1. Anticipation of my intake screening appointment with a therapist specializing in autism in about a week, to determine if I should move forward with adult diagnosis. I am feeling fairly sure in my self assessment, especially since hitting burnout and figuring out what was happening, but am frequently imagining what I will say in the appointment even though I really have no idea yet on the format.
2. Stimming. Now that I am aware of my stimming, including some (realistically many) I didn't even know I was doing before I started watching for them, I feel like I perhaps have more conscious control of whether I do them or not. I feel like I am actually doing things I did subconsciously all the time before (rhythmically twitching my fingers, shaking my hands, etc) less since I am more aware of doing them and just don't. I do literally feel a compulsion to do some things when I am not though. Do those aware of their stimming have to do so more consciously?
3. Some unknown irritant I haven't identified yet.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to how to identify what is bothering you when you are having obvious stress from somewhere in a place that otherwise seems safe and relatively trigger free? I am just wondering if anyone has any suggestions for identifying triggers, or if could be due to lack of conscious stimming (or accidental conscious suppression of stimming).

1896,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-05-17 23:50:25,Valgrimm93,Problems with anxiety meds,"I have recently realized I am very  likely autistic and have been doing a ton of research and searching my past to make sense of things.  About 20 years ago, when I was 27,  I had what I now think was likely autistic burnout, but I was undiagnosed and had no idea what was happening to me.  I just lay in my apartment for days trying to figure out why I had no energy to engage anyone socially or really do anything.   I had microdosed weed all day everyday for about 10 years to calm my mind and feel at peace, and suddenly it reversed and increased my anxiety about 10x.  I felt like the world was falling apart on me.

One day, while laying on the sofa, I saw a Zoloft ad on TV which seemed to describe my most obvious symptoms as social anxiety.  I went to the doctor and told him what was happening.   He gave me some Zoloft and referred me to a psychiatrist, who I saw every few weeks for a year or so after that.  I ended up taking Zoloft and Wellbutrin for a few years before I decided I didn't like what they did to me and opted to wean myself off and just sink myself fully into my interests and minimize social interactions outside friends and family instead. 

Fast forward 20 years and my work and just generally increasing social demands are pushing me to my limits again.  Ended up finding out my problem is more likely autism than social anxiety about 8 weeks ago, as well as being in burnout ever since.  One thing I did turn up in this last 8 weeks,  which I had never thought about before, was that I fell out with almost every friend and family member while I was on Zoloft.  Like serious relationship damaging or ending fallout.  I remembered falling out with all of them previously, but not that that all happened when I was on SSRIs. The Zoloft seemed to remove my anxiety, and with it my mask and almost all sense of social tact.  I just said exactly what was on my mind, with no thought as to the consequences.  While removing my fear of conflict, it certainly didn't do anything at all to increase my social ability or desire for interactions.  It was worse if anything else.  

I am having fairly regular anxiety during my current burnout, but would rather be anxious every day than piss off everyone I know again.  Things would have to be pretty dire for me to try SSRIs again.  The slightly scary part is that it seems to be happening, to some extent, even without the meds.  I guess because my battery is always near zero these days,  I have a hard time controlling both my emotions and responses to things that annoy or upset me.  So far, I have kept the most ""unwise"" responses to friends, family,  and co-workers under wraps, but it has been a challenge.

Not sure where I was going with this or even if it makes any sense,  but posting in case someone can relate.",11,6,6,0.81,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13kiavn')>,,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/13kiavn/problems_with_anxiety_meds/,False
1897,yes,AutismTranslated,2023-05-09 04:58:14,Valgrimm93,Masking is super weird once you can observe yourself doing it,"After many years of not having any idea and just assuming I didn't connect with anyone, I found out 6 weeks ago I was likely autistic, followed almost immediately by a rapid crash and burn.  I have been basically bouncing along through life at almost zero energy since then, while madly researching all I can about autism to try to understand myself and what is going on.  All the things which were stressful and annoying up to this point have become significant problems for me now, as far as social situations and sensory overload.  I have been trying to do my best to relax and recharge as much as possible, but  working in client services, I never seem to gain much before I am drained again.

My work interactions for the last 6 weeks have mostly been by email, Teams chat or phone (ugh, to voicemail those go) so haven't been too hard on me.  Today, I had to have an in person client lunch for the first time since I fully realized my issues.  I was super nauseous and tired on transit to the meeting, keeping my eyes closed, listening to music and trying to sink my attention into random Google feed articles all the way there.   I was grateful our sales person was coming along to carry the conversation. Then I arrived at the restaurant and found our salesperson was 20 minutes late and the client arrived just after I did.

Magically, my nervousness and ill feeling disappeared.  I kept him occupied and managed to steer the conversation to things of interest I could actually talk about.  I felt pretty much just like I always did prior to my burnout while at the lunch with him, minus the sun reminding me of my light sensitivity by blinding me through the clouds while sitting out on the patio.  Granted, I have known the guy in a professional sense for over 10 years and I tend to do better in professional settings, but still.  The changes in me were instant and stark, like I was a different person.  Then, the meeting was over, he left, and I just felt the energy start to drain out of me.  The sales person drove me to the transit station and I slowly regressed back into exactly how I felt before the meeting, except relief that it was past.  Since the meeting, I feel ever increasing exhaustion coming over me and will probably need to sleep early tonight to try and recover.

That was a super weird experience though, since I have never observed myself snapping back and forth between essentially different personalities to fit a situation.  It has always been subconscious and automatic.  Not just putting on a false pretense externally, but more or less being a different person with a different emotional energy level for a short time. No wonder I never had any idea I was doing it before, since it wouldn't have felt like such a massive change from a more normal starting energy level.   Just a weird observation I thought I would share in case anyone can relate.",13,71,71,0.96,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13cfy2y')>,,/r/AutismTranslated/comments/13cfy2y/masking_is_super_weird_once_you_can_observe/,False
1898,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-05-08 06:27:47,Valgrimm93,Looking for advice to prep for screening visit with therapist - ADHD traits for possible AuDHD diagnosis,"I am a 47M who has been researching and going through self discovery for \~6 weeks now. I have an appointment with a therapist specializing in autism in a few weeks and am trying to prepare information. I have listed out a lot of autism traits, compared to the DSM and otherwise, but I am intending to tell him I think I may have both autism and inattentive ADHD (currently not professionally diagnosed with either). For ADHD online screening and trait lists seem much less thorough than the adult autism information. Very brief in most cases and half the questions are more related to the hyperactive presentation, which makes sense but don't apply much to me in particular.

I am wondering, for anyone who has been through both autism and ADHD diagnosis, how did you approach the initial screening when you were successful? I would really like to have my information together in case I turn into a semi coherent potato when I am talking with him. Any advice on how to organize the information and the level of the detail for each of the traits for both I should include? Realistically I now have pages and pages of scattered information in 4 different documents arranged in different ways, which won't do.

I have included my notes regarding traits I think are specifically related to ADHD with a brief explanation of each. Please feel free to read and comment, or not. Keeping in mind there is a another larger list I have for autism related traits, except where they cross over. Please let me know if you think if I should exclude any of this or pare it down further for the therapist (it is only a 50 minute screening visit). Any advice is much appreciated.

ADHD Traits

* Generally disorganised. While I find organisation helpful, I often can't motivate myself to organise myself, in relation to planning, general organisation at home and organisation at work. Am very careful where I store important items such as keys, phone and wallet, since I would otherwise likely often lose them.
* Often keep track of things I need to take care of visually. Will often forget to do what I need to do related to physical item (bill, form, note for follow up at work) etc, if it isn’t right in front of me.
* Rely heavily on the calendar on my phone to keep track of appointments. I likely wouldn’t be able to remember most appointments if they aren’t added to my calendar as soon as I have the information.
* Easily distracted. Often I have problems getting started a task again if I get diverted. May never get back to it, even if I want to do so. (Demand avoidance/inertia?)
* Often have problems getting started on tasks that require some thought and organisation to get them started, even if generally easy. Also sometimes have difficulty finalising the last details for a project that is essentially complete.
* Often very difficult to write things down, even when it's relatively important and something I want to do. For example, when developing recipes related to my interests that would be difficult to remember, I often have to use minimal notes or saved web pages to record the most important details in order to be able to decipher and write it down when I have the motivation to do so. For things like grocery list, always try (with varying success) to remember by memory if at all possible.
* Often fidgeting when sitting or otherwise (likely related to stimming, because is more intense when anxious, focused or excited)
* Often make careless mistakes when distracted.
* Very intense and focused interests. Probably cross over with autism since I tend to have long term interests (many years), short term interests (several months to years) and “flash” interests lasting hours or days (very intense short term interests that often drive me to an end goal, such as purchasing an item I am interested in). These interests choose me, rather than I choosing them, and I often can’t ignore them.
* Often lose track of what someone is saying to me and am poor with verbal instructions. Rarely can focus at all in meetings and usually have to ask others about important details afterward or wait for a written meeting summary.
* Time blindness. Time can seem to fly by in a flash or a minute can seem like an hour. Often late as a result of poor assessment of how long things will take or losing track of time.",2,1,1,0.57,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13bg7rn')>,,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/13bg7rn/looking_for_advice_to_prep_for_screening_visit/,False

1900,yes,AutismTranslated,2023-05-04 06:18:07,Valgrimm93,Difficulties in conversing with friends,"I recently realized I am very likely autistic and have been doing a ton of research on the subject.  One of the main things that brought me to the conclusion that I might be autistic is how much difficulty I have in socializing, even with friends.  In a group of over about 4 people, I am pretty much screwed and never open my mouth unless asked something directly.  I don't really do small talk and find I am not able to really interact in a group setting.  I do also find I have problems even with my current close friends and sometimes in one on one conversations.

The other day, I ran into the description of top down and bottom up processing, which describes how most NT people think vs how many autistic people think.  My understanding is that in top down processing is used by most NTs. They will hear about a specific topic or read an article and generate an opinion there and then largely based on intuition from their past experiences.  Bottom up processing, on the other hand,  is more common in ND people and means that you approach the same topic or article from a detail oriented  approach.  You look into the subject in great detail before forming a balanced opinion based on the information gathered.  The bottom up method is what I do personally and I rarely claim a solid opinion on anything unless I have looked into it thoroughly.  I might say, ""this is what I have heard"", if I have limited information, but I won't claim a solid opinion if I don't have a solid background on the subject. I am also open to someone changing my opinion if they have new information I haven't previously considered.

Thinking on a recent conversation with one of my friends and other similar conversations I have had in the past, I think that is where a lot of what would be a potentially satisfying conversation for me falls apart.  I give a balanced opinion and they reply with a very fixed opinion based on little but an initial impression.  They are usually unwilling to be convinced much beyond that opinion, and don't have any patience for waiting for you to further explain your side.  That is where I usually run into my personal version of the ""boring other people"" question in all the screening tests.   When trying to explain something I am very familiar with, particularly an interest, they will suddenly just change the subject, start talking to someone else over me or someone else will interrupt and that is the end of my conversation.  Pretty frustrating, but I think I have a better understanding of why it happens now.  Not really sure what I can do about it though, since that is just who I am.

Not that I want to move on from my current friends, but I feel like I need to find some more friends that I am able to relate to better and on a wider range of common interests. Most likely from the ND community, based on what I have seen works for many ND people.  Not sure if anyone else can relate to this or has reasoned out the same in their own experiences.",5,11,11,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='137c0aj')>,,/r/AutismTranslated/comments/137c0aj/difficulties_in_conversing_with_friends/,False
1901,yes,AutisticWithADHD,2023-04-28 06:34:33,Valgrimm93,This is quite the journey,"I have posted on a few more specific topics recently but thought I would summarize my 4 week journey and see if anyone could relate or had any advice.

On Mar 27 this year, after feeling a definite increase in anxiety over the last few months since we returned to office work and more of a general normalcy following the lockdowns, I decided maybe some self discovery was in order.  I had had a serious meltdown about 20 years ago which ended in me treated for social anxiety.  I didn't really enjoy what the SSRIs did to me as they turned off my social filter and I had serious issues with almost everyone I knew, since I didn't know how to filter what I was saying on those meds.  I stopped those and managed to find a strategy which got me by (more or less isolation and sinking into my interests).

Now it is 20 years later and I feel a similar building of stress as before my last meltdown.  Some random luck in seeing some autism and ADHD videos on YouTube and TikTok, and I was thinking, ""Some of what those people are saying sounds just like me!!!""  Three days of intense research, doing screening tests, reviewing the DSM-5, looking at peoples experiences on social media later and I was pretty sure it was me.  The only thing is that I had very hazy memories of childhood and thought I needed to dig deeper internally, since I was running out of things to find externally (so I thought).  Next think I know, my brain is involuntarily deciding to do a deep cleaning and reorganizing to dig up childhood memories and reframe remembered experiences with the new information.  

I spent 3 days barely able to think or do anything while my brain reordered and tried to make sense of itself (burnout or meltdown?  I don't know).  Very unpleasant to say the least.  After that was done, I felt like I forgot how to people.  Doing anything was a mental strain and anxiety was constant.  I felt like I had to relearn how to do basic things at work and struggled with essentially all social interactions (fortunately over email and Teams, since I was at home that week).  After about a week, I felt a bit more myself, but have been drained, anxious and immensely distracted until the last few days.  The whole time, including the days I was really having a tough time at the start, I have been driven to spend every spare moment researching all I can about autism and ADHD to exhaustion.

With the help of a combination of Reddit feedback (thanks to you all), reading, looking at information from professionals and people sharing experiences on social media, and self reflection, I have finally managed a clear enough image of myself that my drive is relaxing and I am feeling more comfortable in my own skin.  I have a pretty clear self assessment that I likely have both high masking autism and ADHD with some PDA traits.  I have a preliminary meeting with a therapist specializing in autism and adult diagnosis in 4 weeks.  All sounds great now right?

Well...  Sort of.  I am very happy in how thorough I was able to be in my self discovery process.  Regardless of that, I am still wavering between 95% sure I have it all figured out and 95% sure I am somehow making it all up and it is all a delusion.  Also experiencing sensory issues far above what is usual for me.  I have historically had some sensory discomforts, but since the burnout, has gone far above what it ever was before.  I was feeling pretty good today and went into the grocery store for 10 minutes and my heart rate was up, was anxious, and slightly nauseous within that short time.  Slightly concerned now as my previously ignorant and well masked self never had that hard of a time in my memory.  Discomfort has always been there, but never that bad.

Has anyone had a similar experience after discovering they are likely on the spectrum and a burnout to top it off?  I know everyone may be different, but is it usual that these elevated responses will go back down to the levels I would expect from previous experience over time?  I am also having a hard time keeping my more adamant opinions to myself at work when something annoys me.  I really want to tell people pretty bluntly what I think.  It is all pretty rough at the moment, as a counterbalance to my happiness at having the world make more sense.",4,1,1,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='131jseq')>,,/r/AutisticWithADHD/comments/131jseq/this_is_quite_the_journey/,False
1902,yes,AutisticWithADHD,2023-04-24 08:00:52,Valgrimm93,Aversion to scheduling,"Cross posting this here after a comment on another subreddit that it sounds like perhaps autism with ADHD.  I thought perhaps someone here might relate to this.

I recently realized I probably am autistic, due to a large number of traits in common with the DSM-5 criteria and relating to community experiences, however I noticed there is one major difference between myself and the life experiences described by many autistic people. Most autistic people, including my diagnosed son, seem to hold to rigid schedules and are often distressed when they get off schedule.  Even a lot of neurotypical people seem to have a very tight daily schedule for eating meals, sleep, etc.I, on the other hand, am very adverse to scheduling routine daily events.

I think the reason I tend to prefer as little schedule as possible is that I value being able to complete what tasks I feel I need to complete at the pace I need to complete them over scheduling them for specific times.   It is more important to me to have the full amount of time I need before bed to recharge and calm down, or the full amount of time in the morning to do everything I need to do and mentally prepare for the day without set times to limit my flexibility.  I think feeling I had to complete a daily task, that was not time critical, at a specific time would stress me out unnecessarily.

That is not to say I never schedule anything, since I do sometimes have appointments and so forth which are not flexible. For these, Google Calendar is my saviour.  Scheduled appointments do tend to stress me out and I end up arriving 45 minutes or more before I am supposed to be there just to be sure I am not late.   

Any others in the community with the same inclination as myself?  I realize this might be a me problem.

1904,yes,AutismTranslated,2023-04-23 04:13:33,Valgrimm93,Sensory issues worsened by elevated stress or anxiety,"I had referenced this briefly in another post recently, but I wanted to focus on asking the community specifically about sensory issues, since they have been causing me significant problems for the last few months.

The first time I looked at the DSM-5 and did some of the checklists, I was like, ""Nope!  No sensory issues!""   When I really thought about it though, there are several I have had all my life, which I just never really thought about as more than personal quirks:

1. Bright lights - I realize I don't think I have owned a light that wasn't dim or dimmable in my life.  I seek shade or stay in on sunny days like a vampire.  I hate fluorescent lights or any other bright environments and avoid them when I can.
2. Heat - I absolutely abhor heat and being sweaty.   Constantly have heat rashes and feel exhausted or faint at any temperature above about 22C when outside or 25C when sitting inside.  I will become nauseous or faint if I am out in the sun on a hot day too long.  I know this is probably something everyone experiences, but I crash and burn well before most other people.
3. Sounds - Low constant or repetitive noises, such as tap dripping, ventilation systems; people whispering or making drawn out 's' sounds when speaking.
4. Textures - Clothing textures such as wool or specific non-breathable synthetic fabrics.  Also any food texture similar to soft fat or skin from any kind of meat (not crispy like bacon) literally makes me gag.

I don't experience these at the same level as some autistic people I have seen comment before, where their sensory issues can lead them to a meltdown on their own, so I really don't know if these are all possible autistic traits or just the same personal preferences any NT person would have.  What I can say though, is that low steady background noises and bright lights have been really significantly more troublesome the last few months and especially since I identified them as sources of stress in my self discovery process.

In particular, bright fluorescent lights and white backgrounds on my monitors at work just absolutely melt my eyes recently and give me almost instant headaches.  I have also taken to wearing noise cancelling headphones at work to clear out the ventilation noise and ambient background so I can concentrate.

The other day at work, I made a discovery.   I was at a relatively low stress level that day and for a change had no headache and the lights weren't bothering me too much.  Then I got an email with some good news and it spiked my anxiety (excitement?) for some reason.  Suddenly it was as if they turned the lights to broil and looking at my monitors was almost unbearable for an hour or two until my level of anxiety  went back down to normal.  So my level of sensory discomfort seems directly tied to my ambient and immediate stress levels.

Does anyone else have the same experience as myself, where environmental sensory issues are generally tolerable, but can become intolerable in an instant if other factors in your environment increase your stress level?",7,17,17,0.96,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='12vv6ay')>,,/r/AutismTranslated/comments/12vv6ay/sensory_issues_worsened_by_elevated_stress_or/,False
1905,yes,AutismTranslated,2023-04-21 06:49:40,Valgrimm93,"What is ""normal""?","I am 47 and I have recently discovered  I most likely am autistic.   I essentially worked from home and barely left my house far a few years, during the pandemic, and seem to have lost some learned social skills on the way.  Since things have been more back to normal, I find I am more anxious in public and at my office than I remember.  It led me to reflect on some things that trouble me now, and that I realize have been with me forever.  The things that really made me start looking deeper in the last month were:

1)  Talk of doing semi scripted presentations at work.  This terrifies me and makes me semi shutdown just on rumination.  I can talk to a number of clients on the spur of the moment about a familiar subject to me with little discomfort,  but presenting some random thing for my company is out of the question.   I have no idea what the difference is.   The best I can come up with is that it feels inauthentic to me, similar to small talk, which I am also virtually incapable of doing.

2)  I was in line at the store with a few people in front of me.  I saw the cashier was a cheerful sort and chatty with people in front of me.  While I usually don't make eye contact and try to minimize interactions like that, I do sometimes try to match their energy and return their cheerful demeanor for practice and to be polite.   Oddly,  despite my effort, when it was my turn, he was very flat and business like with no excess chat.  This is not a one off but happens to me frequently.  I don't know if I am reading people wrong or giving off a strange vibe myself that people behave so unexpectedly.

3)  I have long term and short term intense interests which at times are virtually uncontrollable.   For example,  computers and PC games are a long term interest for me.  I don't just play games.  When focused on them,  pretty much all I do is research games or a specific one.  Once I latch onto something interesting I don't own,  i will research it and decide if I would want to buy it.  Then I will check for a sale.  Then buy, if on sale, or think, ""I have such a backlog already.  I will wait for a sale.""  Then after 2 hours of resisting,  dwelling on it, I buy it anyway.  I literally have to avoid looking at some of my more expensive interests to prevent an inevitable purchase of something I probably don't need right then.

4)  I essentially never talk at a gathering of more than 4 people, even if all friends or acquaintances, unless I can talk to one or two at a time.  I am not scared of rejection or anything in that scenario,  so I have no idea why my ability to talk just shuts off.

None of these things made sense to me, so I decided to dig further.  So now my focused interest is neurodiversity itself and I have found a lot more things I do that meet the DSM 5 criteria for autism.  After basically 3 weeks of steady research, I am fairly  sure my self discovery is pointing me in the right direction,  but I keep swaying back and forth between surety and imposter syndrome because of one question.  What is ""normal""?

Some things everyone does to some extent (stimming, for example) so how do you know where it crosses the line to an autistic trait?  How do I know if I can read someone's body language and facial expressions normally since I don't know what a ""normal"" experience is?  I don't know if I really read much visually from people at all.  I mostly read others by what they say and their tone of voice.  That is not even to mention the screening tests where they ask questions about how others see you.  How the hell do I know?  I don't really associate with people who would call me out on the kind of things they are asking about in the questions.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to figure out what is considered ""normal"" when defining an autistic trait vs a similar NT one?  I do have an appointment to talk to a therapist specializing in autism,  but that is in 6 weeks.  Was hoping someone might have some suggestions to help alleviate some of my uncertainty in the meantime.",11,12,12,0.88,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='12tt5er')>,,/r/AutismTranslated/comments/12tt5er/what_is_normal/,False
1906,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-04-19 00:13:32,Valgrimm93,Issues after self diagnosis of autism,"I would like to share my recent experiences in a form slightly longer than War and Peace, after 3 straight weeks of research and self reflection,  but will try to keep this shorter so someone may actually read it. 🙂 

I am a 47M with an officially diagnosed 16 year old autistic son.  I had been having some increased anxiety at work and in social situations since largely being at home during the pandemic.   I started to question (yet again) why I struggle with social interactions so much.  I don't consciously feel like I care what people think of me, but avoid social interactions like the plague (and have for most of my life).  Thinking back on my current and past life,  I ran into more and more illogical contradictions in my behavior I couldn't make work.  In addition, as my son grows older,  he seems more and more like how I was at his age (and beyond). 

I decided it was time for some self reflection and, in the process, ran across many instances online of autistic people sharing their experiences that struck chords with me so strongly they brought tears to my eyes.  I began digging deeper into official medical information and felt like it perhaps didn't sound like me, but was better framed when I heard others explain what the criteria represented in actual behavior.  About 3 days in to my research,  I decided I needed to really dig back into my memories to see if this was really with me since childhood or if it was actually social anxiety disorder, as I was diagnosed with at 28 after a multiple day severe burnout.  That is when it happened...

My mind apparently decided to make my inner examination of my past my new very intense focus interest (of which I have always had one or more throughout my life) and seemed to try to tear itself apart looking inward for answers.  I would describe it as like taking everything out of every storage area in your house and throwing it all over the floor at once and then trying to slowly figure out how to put it all back together in a way that made sense.  I spent 3 days after that in intense mental pain and stress as my brain tried to forcibly sort things out.  I did actually successfully pull a bunch of long forgotten things out of my past which fit that I was very likely autistic as a child, though apparently mostly unrecognized by my parents and teachers due to presentation and circumstance.  I was also driven to keep researching and finding experiences of autistic people which would give me a new spike of mental strain whenever something clicked into place.  

After 3 days of this,  I was mentally exhausted and barely able to think at all.  I was having persistent anxiety and decided I needed some professional help to sort this all out.  I contacted our local autism organization and asked for a list of providers familiar with autistic adults.  I sent an email to the recommended therapist who may be able to provide an adult diagnosis, with the hope I could use it for accommodations at work and for peace of mind.

Because I know that is a long process and I was hoping some clarity from my parents would help.  I knew it was a mistake, but hoped somehow they would be understanding despite my reservations.   Well that didn't go well.  They told me some additional things which supported what I had remembered myself until they found out why I was asking.  My father literally tried to force my left-handed brother to be right-handed as a child, so I don't know why he would ever support me in something he would consider stigmatized as much as autism.  My mother views the world through rose colored glasses so of course said things that made it obvious she was glossing over things I clearly remembered having issues with let alone remembering me as anything but perfectly well adjusted.  I figure that ends any hope of official diagnosis since my parents won't cooperate and wouldn't want to see me with that label.

Next I decided to talk to my manager at work  to see if I could get any accommodations based on my anxiety alone, which did go much better.  They basically agreed to take anything off my plate that was affecting my mental health and I just had to ask.  That made me feel a spike of peace and relief temporarily since that essentially removed one major reason for even getting a diagnosis.  Now there is just my own peace of mind.

I am now 2 weeks past all this and still obsessed with  researching autism and related conditions.   I seem to clearly have symptoms of both autism and ADHD that go back as far as I can remember.  I have recognized sensory issues such a bright light, heat and repetitive noises, such as a dripping tap or ambient quiet office noises,  as things that bother me much more than I ever recognized before.  I am not sure if my near constant elevated anxiety for the last 3 weeks is contributing, but bright lights and even ambient light outside on a cloudy day have become literally painful.  Social interactions are even more difficult than usual and my previous ability to look people in the eyes, if necessary,  is much more difficult.  Because of such a sudden increase in intensity for these issues,  I feel like I am faking it somehow,  although I can't imagine why I would want life to suck so much on a daily basis when I was doing a passable job of getting by with all this stuff hidden from myself (and perhaps everyone else) before.  I feel like I opened Pandora's box and can't decide if I am relieved to have found others experiencing the same life issues as me or regret that  I ever opened it to begin with.  

Now for the questions:

1) Has anyone had an intense, almost involuntary, brain restructuring experience as I did?  I don't know if it was overload or what, but it was very painful and stressful even if strangely satisfying since it helped me fit things together.  I am still anxious and barely able to think clearly due to mental exhaustion weeks later, as I write this.

2) Has anyone had a sudden increase in intensity of sensory input and social discomfort after diagnosis or self diagnosis?  I am wondering if it is just because my base anxiety levels are so high that I have no headroom without going over the top with any added stress. Perhaps they will go down to a more routine level once I make more progress in working through this.

3)  I don't actually know what to do now.  I am not sure I need an official diagnosis anymore, since my work will accommodate me on my social anxiety history alone.  Even though I am quite sure I am right with my self diagnosis,  I still am having pretty significant imposter syndrome.  I continue to research endlessly, hoping for an answer I will likely never find myself, in a way that will satisfy my need for confirmation.  I am wondering if seeing a therapist who has experience with autistic adults may be able to help me work through this, as I feel stuck.  I am just not sure what I would be looking for from a therapist besides confirmation, which would likely only come with a positive diagnosis.  Any advice is welcome.

1912,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-05-05 07:18:13,Taeress,Alexithymia and Eye Contact,"For context: I am about 7 weeks out from accepting that I am autistic.  However, while I may be new to autism, I am not new to alexithymia; I may not have had a word for it until very recently, but I've been aware that my emotions are an enigma to me for at least 15 years, probably longer.

Eye contact (or lack thereof) is, of course, a whole thing.  My experience, however, has been that \*looking into someone's eyes\* doesn't really bother me on its own.  Instead, it's more like a little spike of anxiety when I initiate the contact.  Before, it would go something like:

1. Person reaches the requisite distance for acknowledgement  
2. Anxiety spike  
3. Look them in the eyes (To be fair, I'm not actually sure if I was looking people in the eyes before, at least not all the time...I wasn't hyper-analyzing yet, but I know that I would look at eyes at least some of the time)

Note that the anxiety spike has more to do with the thought of having to make a connection with another human being, rather than the actual act itself.  I do struggle to maintain once I've made the contact, but it's never exactly uncomfortable for me.

But that just makes me wonder.  Is it ""supposed"" to be uncomfortable?  Is it nothing more than one's instincts being incompatible with NT expectations, or is there some sort of bad feels accompanying it?  If it is bad feels, then it seems like, much as all of my emotional responses happen, I am feeling it, it's just not registering with my actual conscious mind.  In which case, the anxiety spike that I've just assumed all this time was social anxiety might be my body reacting to the pain it knows is coming, and likewise, the struggle to maintain would be my body trying to escape the pain.

What's everyone else's experience with making eye contact?

No, I'm feeling deeply frustrated and angry right now, because I've gone 35 years up to this point feeling like a complete alien, who never quite managed to fully fit in with everyone else, until now, when I've finally found the places that people who are actually like me have been all this time.  A whole community that maybe I could truly jive with for the first time in my life.  A place to belong.  So, yes, I want to pursue the diagnosis, full stop, unequivocally.  \*I want to be able to embrace this part of me.\*

But.

Edit: forgot to say how I learned lol. Took some tests, then talked with my partner of 7 years. She agreed, apparently thought so since we met but there's no good time to say something like that ""hey you're cute and sorry about your trauma I also think you have autism"". Then today i talked with my therapist that I've been with for two years (for my own other stuff lol) and he agreed that it explains many things, and reframing past events helps. So he's going to treat me as if I have it, and recommended I get tested, which will take 7 months to schedule.

Edit 2: Oh wow some of you guys are way over valuing the tests and do not consider a licensed therapist who's been working 15+ years and has been my therapist for over 2 years to be a good judge. Obviously a few online quizzes are gonna do much, which is why I discussed them with my CACREP accredited counselor.

[https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/1484016-soks-sanctuary](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/1484016-soks-sanctuary)

""Sok's Sanctuary; 3rd level, conjuration, ritual:

V/S/M - a bedroll\*, a set of carpenter's or mason's tools, and a backpack containing at least 50 gp worth of tools or other adventuring gear\*\*)

You conjure a multi-story tower made of stone, wood, or similar suitably sturdy materials. The tower can be round or square in shape. Each level of the tower is 10 feet tall and has an area of up to 100 square feet. Access between levels consists of a simple ladder and hatch. Each level takes one of the following forms, chosen by rolling a d8 per level of the spell and consulting the table below: 

**D8 - Structure:**

1- An, unfurnished, empty room

2- A washroom with toilets, washtubs, a magical brazier, and sauna benches

3 - A dining space with a table, chairs, magical fireplace, and cooking utensils

4- A lounge with couches, armchairs, side tables and footstools

5- An observatory with a telescope and maps of the night sky

6- A bedroom with a bed\*, chairs, chest, and magical fireplace (\**or a barracks room with as many bedrolls as were used in the material components)*

7 - A study with desks, books, bookshelves, parchments, ink, and ink pens

8 - Roll again. If you roll another 8, you may choose any of the above options

\*\* - (for every 25 gp worth of adventuring gear above 50, you may choose the structure of one story of the tower, rather than roll a die. ""Adventuring gear"" for this purpose does not include, weapons, armor, or shields, nor other magical items)

Your DM may edit this table at their discretion.

The interior of the tower is warm and dry, regardless of conditions outside. Any equipment or furnishings conjured with the tower dissipate into smoke if removed from it. At the end of the spell’s duration, all creatures within the tower appear safely outside on the ground, and all traces of the tower and its furnishings disappear. Any items left remaining that were not created by the spell are shunted to an extradimensional space, and may be retrieved from the backpack by the original caster by expending a third level spell slot and making a successful DC 20 Intelligence (arcana) check. 

You can cast this spell again while it is active to maintain the tower’s existence for another 24 hours. You can create a permanent tower by casting this spell in the same location and with the same configuration every day for one year.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the tower can have one additional story for each slot level beyond 3rd. ",2,2,2,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='v6naom')>,,/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/v6naom/sharing_a_spell_i_wanted_to_run_based_on_galders/,False

I have been bullied by some of my family for years off and on. One of them is an in-law who I thankfully  never see. Although I feel bitter that they bullied me because I genuinely looked up to them and thought they were a great person until they verbally abused me. This in-law is married to my cousin. She is a theatrical performer in our town, a very lively and multi-skilled person, amazing at decor, acting, singing, and takes care of rescued animals. I thought she was amazing. Then she randomly put me down when I began pursuing art and called me a one trick pony. My view of her changed completely and I realized she thought nothing of me at all. She had sort of been rude to me in other ways but I didn't pick up on them til later cause of my autism. 

She is married to my cousin who is a magician. He is also an amazingly talented person. But he and my other cousin/his sister started putting me down at family get togethers. My cousin revealed himself to be homophobic, and his sister/my other cousin became extremely verbally abusive toward me at every family event I encountered her at because she is hateful toward me for inheriting my deceased grandma's condo. It is seriously heavy stuff. Both he and her began calling me things and making me feel like scum without any understanding of my situation and needs as a disabled person. 

My cousin is now dying of a brain tumour that came back after being removed once years ago when he was a teenager. I have a ton of happy memories of him even if our relationship deteriorated. He made our childhood for my younger cousins, my sister and I so much fun. He was the life of the party. He was also an asshole and completely insensitive to people like me who is is neurodivergent and lgbt when I got older. My family has overall expressed hate and disdain toward me for not being a neurotypical and heterosexual adult. Now one of them is dying. Our last interaction was cold. My dad had his 70th birthday which I attended this winter, but I felt unsafe to socialize with anyone since I expected them to bully me. So I hid downstairs in the basement and basically just kind of blocked everything out til they were gone.

That probably puts me more in a non-binary place but I go by she/her pronouns. My fiancé doesn't truly understand the concept, he's always felt like a man and never questioned himself being anything other than a straight man. Nothing wrong with that but it makes it harder to get him empathize with others. He lacks a lot of empathy unless it's for some he cares about but most everyone close to him fit the same mold, I'm probably that main who ever pushed his boundaries of understanding. He has read a lot of horror stories of surgeries going wrong or parents trying to push their children in a gender role they don't wanna be. Even though I told him the amount of people who transitioned back to their birth gender is less than 2% of the transgender community, he still doesn't understand why someone would put their body through the pain of transitioning.

She was one of the few that was hard to catch go get spayed. Anyways, we assume she gave birth to four kittens as she brought three to my parents and one appeared six months later looking just like mama. My parents kept two named D and V and I kept the one that showed up later, named P. Names kept vague to keep anonymity.

Well, D is a girl, my parents waited to long to get her fixed because it's expensive and they live on a tight budget. D recently gave birth, she had two kittens but one died. My parents are pretty much forcing D to spend time with the kitten because baby needs to eat. They think the first might have died from her moving them all the time and might have smothered it. Advice on this situation would be nice, they can't really afford to take D or the kitten to a vet, I live in the USA and vets charge some pretty high bills.

I still have P, she has been spayed already but always had a strong reaction to hearing kitten cries. I'd sometimes watch little clips with kittens in them and if she heard them, she would come right to me and look around for the kittens. I'm thinking that it might be best to try and introduce P to this kitten her sister D doesn't want. I'm not sure if P would be able to tell the kitten is related or not. My biggest worry is if P will produce milk for the kitten or if I'll need to work on feeding said kitten every two hours which I can't do as I work 8hr shifts.

So, any thoughts, opinions, or advice are welcomed. My parents are the type to let nature take its course so I can't convince them to take the surviving kitten to a shelter to take care of them.

I had been working 12hr shifts five days a week, learning on living on my own with my roommate and boyfriend, and lost my car maybe a month prior. I worked at a warehouse in GA that had no AC; I was given this large order that I hated doing. While I worked on the order, I had this creeping feeling of struggling to breath. I just kept ignoring it but it was getting worse. I ran into my boyfriend at work and it just spilled out of me, I started crying and was struggling to breath. I wasn't in a state to keep operating the machine we used to move around the warehouse. After that time, I started taking Zoloft.

I've been doing better but lately I feel like it's coming back. I had a panic attack at my job today, I currently work in retail and yesterday was super busy and even though I only have a 5 hour shift today, the nonstop growing line caused this feeling of struggling to breath. I called one of the managers over and asked her to take over for me while I take a minute to breath. I went to the family bathroom we have as it was the only private one.

I ended up breaking one of the wires for the hot end so I replaced that.
I went to try printing again but it still didn't seem to come out right. I was having it remove the filament when it got stuck in the extruder. Try as I may, I couldn't get it out so I ordered a new bowden extruder.
After all that, it was printing okay again. Looks like maybe the hot end is getting too hot because I noticed what look liked burnt spots on the print but it evened out the longer I let it print.
Now to today, the nozzle looked gross being covered in what looked like burnt filament so I replaced it. It seemed all was well, went to remove filament and seemed stuck so I made the extruder push the filament back in, unscrewed the connecter and cut the clog. As I screwed the connecter back in, I managed to screw it tight enough that it broke. In the extruder...

So, all in all, I just want advice on what parts to get. I just ordered a new extruder but I have a lot of leftover pieces for the extruder in case I need them.",1,2,2,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='1272g9u')>,,/r/anycubic/comments/1272g9u/upgrades_for_kobra_max/,False

So, this was a couple of years ago, it's just something that comes to mind now and again.

I'd like to say I wasn't close with this family member, he was my stepmother's brother. He had a lot of issues from an accident when he was young. He had seizures to a point that a good chunk of his brain was removed to help control them. He wasn't in a good way for a long time as he just couldn't get freedom from his family. If more detail is wanted, I'm okay providing it but this isn't really about him. He did commit suicide one night and wasn't found till the morning. Understandably, everyone was upset. I wasn't close to him but I still felt he didn't deserve to go out that way.

Well, his funeral comes. He was cremated and put in a vault with other ashes in these glass boxes that also had his picture and a few of his things. I remember this well as everyone talked about how they loved him, told stories of him, and then my stepmom played a voice-mail he left for her. That's when this feeling struck me. I had none of that with my own mom. She passed away when I was 18, I'm now 25. I wasn't close with her because she was an addict and neglected me a lot when I was young before my dad got custody. However, I still loved her, she was my mom no matter. I feel guilt for thinking about her during that funeral. I have barely any photos of her, no old voice mails. Just a few letters that read like the ramblings of a mad woman. I wish I had more than that, stuff of hers before she was too far gone. All of her things is with my half sister but I refuse to speak with her. She is an addict as well and believes my dad brainwashed me against them and that one day I'll just return when I'm free of him. She also thinks my mom's death wasn't an accidental overdose and said to me ""She just missed her baby so much"" the day I visited after her death. That still hurts to remember, no one ever wants to believe they are the reason their parent died. My dad told me she has had at least 7 overdoses and this one just happened to be fatal.

I just wanted that off my chest. Maybe there are other people who could understand this feeling of disconnect but the disgust for that half too.",1,3,3,0.8,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='10uyhy1')>,,/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/10uyhy1/a_funeral_made_me_realize_things_i_missed_out_on/,False
1976,yes,cats,2023-01-10 07:10:22,introvertedfreak21,"Just gushing about my cat, Pepper","So, about three days ago, my fiance and I got our first pet. My parents have a cat colony around their home, they feed the cats and sometimes new ones show up. They only have one fertile female that has been hard to trap to spay and that cat had some kittens. We thought it was just three, two gray and one black and white. One gray boy was given to a family friend and my parents kept the other two. Well, about a week ago a gray female cat started showing up. She looks exactly like the mom cat and the gray brother my parents have so we think she is the same age as the other kittens. She isn't spayed yet but my parents told us she was a very friendly cat and were able to get her inside so we could take her home.

So, there is the story of how we got Pepper. She has been slowly coming out of her shell, its a big change from an outdoor cat colony. I'm just so happy and proud to see how far she has come. She went from hiding under our bed and only popping her head out to eat food and get a few pets to now, coming out and chilling on her own, being curious in what's beyond the bedroom door(it stays closed for now) and really enjoying our company.

Every little step forward makes me so happy. She is the first pet we have owned outside our parents' homes. I'm thinking of ways to make her happy and healthy. I don't use a gravity feeder because I've seen how it let's a cat over eat and I plan to use things like raw meat as a treat and changing up her food options. Like she has been doing great today so I gave her half a can of wet food as a treat for being so confident today. I would love any advice as well, I just want to give this sweet girl the best life I can for her. I'm gonna give her a month to get use to the house before I take her to the vet to be spayed and vaccinated. Thankfully at least 40 cats of the cat colony had been fixed, vaccinated, and had their ears tipped.

So, as many know, there has been a huge blast of cold that hit Georgia. A few of my neighbors also have this issue. Sometime between 8am and 11am, my pipes froze. I will admit I forgot to leave my faucet dripping however a neighbor of mine did leave her dripping and the pipe still froze. I leave in a mobile home so I can understand how easy it would be for the pipes to freeze.

Here is my issue. My landlord sucks, she is just very unhelpful and doesn't care for her tenants. I've had a light unit in my bathroom out for a year, she just keeps making excuses as to why it isn't fixed yet. I also have water leaking out from my front door and she just hasn't sent anyone to help fix it.

The main issue; I had to call my local water company to see if they could help. They couldn't but it took them calling my landlord for her to get back to me on my frozen pipe. I have hex pipes so they won't burst easily however I was told unless the pipe bursts, they just won't send anyone out to help me. She told me to just put a heater under my house but the problem is that I don't have a heater and I'm not a plumber, so I don't know how to tell what pipe is frozen. From what I could tell with the help of my father, the water meter could be frozen. The dial on it wasn't moving at all. It's now Saturday, I know Christmas Eve, and I've been without water since yesterday.

I would appreciate any advice in this situation.

I made sure there was no food left on dishes I put in the sink, and so on. Recently I noticed they came back and it's through a seal break on our back door. We rent so we can't really do anything and if we say we found the seal break because of ants, we are told bugs are our problems to deal with. I couldn't really figure out what they were after because they were in an area that we don't eat near and isn't close to the sink. Earlier today I decided to see how many packaged muffins we had left since we buy them in bulk. Come to find out, the ants were trying to get to the muffins. It seems the packaging was well sealed because they couldn't get through. They mostly wanted the chocolate muffin so I just took the few muffins we had out of the box, put them in a gallon ziploc bag, and threw the box away. I could see in the packaging that there were no ants in the food, just crawling on the plastic trying to get in. So, I've come to ask what others recommend. I can't afford the expense of calling an exterminator nor is the problem bad enough that I need one.

It means a lot to me to have just that little bit but now it becoming harder. I had started with just changing my diet and some walks here and there.

So, things were insane when I started because covid cases were piling up in my area and only two out of seven techs were certified. I thought I'd share a funny story that happened and hope that others will share as well!

I'm not sure what month this happened, maybe November but it was just myself, one other tech, and a floater pharmacist. I remember this well because it was so out of nowhere. We had just switched form having only 16 vaccines max to 32 vaccines so it was hard to keep up. We had a group of about five older ladies form a nursing home all come in for their booster dose. They had been patiently waiting when this one lady walks up to the drop off counter.

The pharmacist is busy setting up vaccines so the other tech goes to talk to the lady. She was dropping off a prescription for Hydrocodone or something like that. I heard the tech say we would have it ready by 5pm, which was about a 3hr wait. The lady gets mad and wants to know why we can't have it sooner. We explain to her that five vaccines just came in and our pharmacist is too busy at this moment and we aren't allowed to check prescriptions(neither of us were trained on data entry at the time).

Instead of, ya know, being reasonable and just coming back later. She starts saying she'll call the news because pharmacies won't fill prescriptions because of vaccines. It was so out of nowhere, she's yelling and demanding we get her prescription ready because she's sick and needs it. She mentions something about she might have covid and needs that medicine for it. A pain med for covid? I doubt when she wasn't even wearing a mask and was standing up just fine. She won't leave till we fill it so we call a store manager down as well work in a Kroger store. The minute the manager shows up, she starts playing up the sad act, saying we won't fill it and that she's very sick. Doesn't mention the news now but in the end, we just hand back her prescription and let her leave.

Covid led to a lot of angry customers. More so when we had a common pharmacist in that just couldn't tell people no when we were already swamped. Thankfully we are more caught up now and for some reason people just aren't showing up for their vaccine appointments or buying the tons of at-home covid tests we have.",0,11,11,0.87,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='t34qm7')>,,/r/PharmacyTechnician/comments/t34qm7/weird_pharmacy_stories_during_2021/,False

The dream felt too vivid, too graphic to be something I haven't seen or heard. Consider this a warning as that dream is graphic and mentions things some may find unsettling.



Now that the warning is there, I shall describe the dream.

It was like I was watching a tv show but there was no TV I was looking at. Like I was simply watching this older man who is a teacher. I could feel the wicked intentions he had in his heart, the unsettling things he wanted to do to children. He had volunteer to be a chaperone for a overnight field trip for his school. Its pretty hazy what happened on the trip until it was night time. The man finally seemed to be losing control over his urges, I knew what he wanted to do and only hoped it wouldn't happen.

He went to the boy's area, where the young boys were all sleeping. I'm not sure exactly why, but he thought it best to climb through a window, going so far as to remove the whole glass window itself. However, he was unaware that the window was a recent admin. Things are going to become graphic now.

As he climbed through the window and landed on the ground, a large clunk of the window pane broke off and stabbed straight into his back, closer to his right shoulder. It was not a small piece, blood was pushing it's way out his body around the wound. His screams woke up the boys but they were all so young, they didn't know what they were seeing in the dark. He begged them to call 911 but the kids, so frightened, ran out of the room to find other adults. The man somehow was still able to move, he kept trying to get back off the floor but kept slipping on pools of his own blood. He eventually managed to get up and out the small room, desperately looking for help before he bleed out. He didn't make it far before he had passed out form blood loss. By the time EMT's arrived on the scene for the man, he was gone. He had simply died from blood loss.

Now, to me, this dream just felt very graphic. I rarely have violent dreams like that, my dream are usually around things that happened in the past for me or just really outlandishly vivid. This just feels so out of place, I don't dream such unsettling things. I remember even in my dream, I tried to look away as the man was dying. It just felt too real, like it was some new article I read or some video I briefly saw.

1989,yes,Petloss,2021-11-09 08:03:29,introvertedfreak21,Seeing their pictures still makes my heart ache,"I'm a huge lover of cats, they are a bit part of me and my love for cats helped me learn to love reading. Anyone who knows me, knows I love cats and know way too much about them.

However, I don't have a family that feels the same way or understand that pets I take care of are family to me and hurt just as much as losing a family member.

I remember having several cats but only a few I still have pictures of on my phone. I'd just like to tell their stories and hope there are others who understand and maybe can offer advice in moving on. I'm going in order of oldest to most recent. These will be long, sorry.

Chicken is one cat that really stands out in my memory. She was part of a litter of kittens another cat of ours had. She was this cute little white kitten with black spots, she looked like the common Chick-fil-a cow so we named her chicken. I loved that cat so much, I am so sad I didn't have a smart phone then to take pictures of her. I remember when she was pregnant, she choose to have her kittens in my closet of all the places. I thought of it as a sweet gesture(thankfully I didn't have anything on the floor of the closet) because it meant my room and my scent on my clothes made her feel safe. As time went on, my parents eventually felt we had too many cats and would frequently make them stay outside after we got them all fixed. There was a time where chicken wasn't coming home, I hadn't seen her in a week and I was so worried about her. One day after school, I came home and as I was heading into the kitchen to grab a snack, I heard a meow. There was chicken on the back porch. She didn't look in great shape, she was weak but still purred and loved the attention I gave her. I told her to wait and went inside to grab her some food. Sadly, when I came back, she was gone. That was the last time I saw her and I believe that she knew her time was up and she just wanted to say goodbye to me.

Next were Elmo and Oscar. They came along awhile after we eventually gave away all our other cats. We didn't have any at all and one day, my dad was working on his truck when this cute cat with a marble cost of brown and black strolled up to him. We decided to keep the cat as he was very friendly and we got him fixed. That was Elmo, we believed he was the neighborhood tom cat until we fixed him. After that, we talked about getting another cat. My grandfather happened to have some kittens form his orange and white cat. They were too big for the boxes they had so he put the kittens in a trash can do he could bring them all over and we could pick them out. They were all orange and white but my family really liked this one with a small orange spot on his nose. We wanted to stick with a sesame street theme. It was hard picking a name until we landed on Oscar like Oscar the Grouch because we got him out of a trash can. They were with us for a long time and they were both neutered. I have a good bit of photos of them, Oscar was a really weird cat though. He would eat the tops of pineapples of grass. He liked running with his claws out and rip up the carpet. He was still funny and I enjoyed having him around. We had decided to move out of our old place and moved somewhere else for a short time.

During that time is when I found my next cat, Junior. I had gone through a rough break up, I was in a bad depression spiral as I wasn't holding down a job well and just didn't enjoy life at that time. While out with a friend of mine, we pulled up to a restaurant, as well were getting out the car, I could hear this faint mew. My friend thought it was so bird but I decided to look around. The area was newly built so when I saw this little kitten covered in dust, I knew I couldn't leave it there. Poor thing was thin but so sweet and friendly. I tried to look and see if the mother was nearby but after awhile, she never appeared. I called my dad and begged him to let bring this cat home. He said we would keep the cat until we found a new home for him. That didn't happen at first, everyone loved the cute kitten and since I wasn't working much, I was the main one taking care of this kitten. However Oscar was not a fan of this kitten. He would actively hiss at the kitten and would start peeing. I knew he was just being protective of his space but since our other cat elmo had zero reaction to the kitten, my parents decided that oscar couldn't stay. I didn't want him to go and hoped we could find him a new home. Back then, I was unaware how hard it is for an older cat to be away from it's home. Sadly, that choice was not my own. My dad chose to take Oscar to an area where new homes were being built and just drop him off. I feel so bad that this is what happened to him. I didn't want this for him but it was done and I couldn't say goodbye.

To explain the name, we were undecided what to name him. I wanted to name him Goober but my dad refused that name. My sister suggested Loki, my stepmom picked Elmo Junior, and I forgot what my dad picked. We put the names in a hat, shook it around and I pulled one out. His name was form then on, Elmo Junior as he had the same brown and black color scheme but with strips instead of a marble pattern. Having him around helped me a lot, he gave me a reason to get up in the morning, he would sleep by my head and cry until I opened my door for him. I loved that cat so much. I still loved him even when he sprayed on me on my birthday. However, we had to move again and this time, more cats showed up. Elmo liked being part of a two cat household and going outside but with all these other cats around, he eventually just left. We don't know when he left, we put up a post on facebook and fliers but he just never came home.

With this new house came other problems, my parents were letting the other cats in. I knew this wasn't a good idea but not my choice, again. So, Junior didn't like this and would spray wherever he smelled another cat. So, my parents made a rule that all cats must stay outside because they didn't want a house that smelled of cat pee. I would try to make time to spend with Junior, he was a very needy and sweet cat. Every day I came home from work, he would come running when I called or heard my car pull in. He would hop on our outside freezer and just meow for my attention to pet him. I would sneak him in sometimes and he would just be the happiest cat, purring the whole time and just being lovey. However, my love for this cat was once again, disregarded. I was spending the weekend at my bf's house when my dad had some friends over. He did mention that one of his friends was looking to get a cat as he had two kids that loved cats. I knew a cat would be gone but we had so many, I didn't think that it would end up being MY cat. Worse part, my dad didn't tell me for two weeks. He had planned for us all to go up to a haunted house so he didn't want me to ruin it by being upset over my cat being gone. He told me about a week after that as I was starting to look into getting posters to put up for Junior. When he told me, I cried. I cried so hard as I really wanted to take that cat with me when I moved out. I had raised that cat, he was my baby and I loved him. I remember that day when I was crying, my dad literally told me this is why he didn't tell me sooner as I would've ruined the trip with my crying. I know, that's obvious gaslighting but its hard to see that form a parent when I lived with them. I still really miss that cat, even as the memories being to fade. Though, my dad showed me pictures of Junior in his new home, told me how he brought his new family a dead mouse that same night as he was happy with them, I was glad he at least went somewhere he was happy.

As I was getting used to Junior being gone and just enjoying the many other cats we had, my dad brought home another kitten that he found some guy giving away out of his barn. Of course, I was happy to help clean this kitten up as it was covered in fleas and dirt but a bath with dawn soap fixed that issue. We named him JC as the place he was form was some kinda Christian place, not a church really. He was also a sweetheart, loved spending time with me but he was full of tons of energy. We didn't have him as long as Junior though I still loved JC. He would always come when I called and would play with anything. He got use to the other outside cats and I could tell he was really close with our really skiddish cat, Yang. Sadly, one of my dad's friends liked the look of JC form the pictures my dad would post. This time he warned me ahead of time so I was able to prepare for JC leaving. I got to spend one night with him, just giving him lots of love, playing with him, just enjoy my last time with him. I knew I couldn't stop my dad form taking JC away, it wasn't my house to make that choice. It still hurt but I think by this point, I learned to not get attached to cats when living with my parents because it was always the cats I raised that people wanted to take.

But what brought all these memories back were that I was scrolling through my photos looking for an old photo to send to a friend when I saw these pictures I had of these cats. It made my heart ache all over again, I still miss them all and wish I could've given them better lives. I wanna adopt a senior cat so that way I can give that cat somewhere happy to live. Most of these cats were found between the ages of 13 to 21 to help with the timeline. I moved out a year ago and I'm now 24, I don't have my own cat as my landlady doesn't allow pets but I will get one again, I miss having them around so badly.",7,10,10,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='qpyxue')>,,/r/Petloss/comments/qpyxue/seeing_their_pictures_still_makes_my_heart_ache/,False
1990,yes,Advice,2021-10-24 00:26:29,introvertedfreak21,Help cheering up a partner,"So, my boyfriend(25) and I(24f) have been together for almost five years. Even though we've had all this time together, I sometimes fill struggle to figure out how to cheer him up. One thing to consider is that he has very mild autism, its almost unnoticeable to most people. I only see small things with it, like a lack of empathy sometimes.

My problem I think lays mainly in helping make him feel better about himself. We come from very different backgrounds. I grew up poor, had two family vacations my whole life. My family scraped by with what they could and they never made it easy on themselves. They liked to drink and party like they were in their 20's and use their kids as therapists. I grew up in a very unstable home so any achievements I made, no matter the size, meant a lot to me. Buying my own car on an auto loan meant a lot even though it was totaled a year later. Moving out on my own meant alot, even if I had to have help to do it. Every little step meant something big to me.

My boyfriend is the opposite. His dad pretty much went to the military, worked on planes there, and once he was out, pretty much got a really good job. He wasn't set for life by any means. He had a wife with two kids not his own to take care and then his own kid as well. He had to not only work his job building planes, but a second one to keep up with the problems around his wife. Once she had passed away, his dad used that money form her death to just take the kids of a bunch of vacations. He didn't want to think of his grief, he didn't want his kids sad. I understand the sentiment but at the end of the day, I feel he should've given his children time to process their grief and have them a stable environment.  My boyfriend had been on more vacations than just the ones right after his mom's passing. He was only 14 at the time, once his dad moved on and met another woman who also had a good income, they took a lot of vacations and usually brought their families with them. 

But besides the vacations, Ben's dad never really pushed him much in school to do well. Always told him that to just go into the military and they will set you up for life. He has great ASVAB scores but because of his autism, he refused to see the military as his family. They couldn't break him like other soliders but also he had a hole in his heart they worried about. He finished basically training but they just discharged him. He hurt a lot after that, he felt like such a let down and couldn't believe he failed. Next he went and tried going to school to become a jet mechanic like his dad, even got a huge loan on his head just in hopes that would pan out. He did great in the classes, always good scores. But when it came to the final tests, he couldn't pass them. Not all his fault, a part of the test was not taught to him which was wielding metal together. After spending too much many and failing too many times, he gave up on that path and once again, felt like a failure. Nowadays, he can't seem to shake that feeling. I've tried my best to make him feel better but I just don't know how. I've slowly been working on his issues form the problems his family caused, like getting him use to being touched, pointing out stuff he shouldn't bring up around others, and helping him show its safe to come to me when he feels down. I know it isn't easy, his family really didn't treat him with much love as a kid.

I mainly just want any advice on how to help show him he's not a failure, that he can accomplish things on his own and doesn't need to rely on others. He mainly worries about the student loan on his head as its about $29k left on it form the original $40k. I try to remind him of what things he has accomplished but they all seem like small stuff to him, like living on his own with me and my roommate. It also doesn't help that his dad makes it seem easy to just be successful and pressures him to do better as an adult. He also acts like that just because Ben is over 21, he should have his life figured out.

Any advice would be appreciated. I just love him so much and want him happy.",0,1,1,0.67,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='qeh49r')>,,/r/Advice/comments/qeh49r/help_cheering_up_a_partner/,False

1992,yes,rant,2021-08-30 03:21:54,introvertedfreak21,The though of seeing my dad makes me have a panic attack,"I'm not really sure if this is really my dad being a narcissist or just he's not right in the head anymore.

About a year ago, my dad just suddenly started having seizures, we found out it was because of a blockage in his heart. But he had so many that I feel like its done too much damage. I try to understand that but its just one those things I can't get over.

My sister and step mom notice it too. For me, any time he wants to try to get his way with me(I.e. if he insists on calling me while I'm at work and I just can't call) he will use a guilt trip. Its normally something about ""You are my only kid."" He has raised two daughters, I'm just the only one by blood. ""You are the last of my bloodline."" He actually has a son by another woman, just they don't talk. ""It will always be just you and me."" That one always pisses me off. That's not a life I want, I have a partner who has been with me through thick and thin for the last five years, he will never not be in my life.

Other examples are stuff like when talking to him, its like he's not listening. He'll repeat his point again at you, like you didn't hear him the first time. One time we were eating at a restaurant and he just suddenly started talking about something we talked about hours ago.

He's also just irresponsible now, he keeps mixing Xanax with alcohol. I know, it's literally the one thing any one would tell you not to do. They aren't even his, they are for my stepmom who has an anxiety disorder. He also likes to help out his friends all the time without talking to his wife. He also talks about divorcing her all the time but I don't think he should. Any woman willing to put with all that form him really does love him.

I needed to vent about these things because ever since I moved out in December of 2020, He's gotten worse about bothering me. He just can't seem to understand that I live my own life now, I can't just drop by whenever he wants me too nor do I like him just dropping by unacounced. He'll always be my dad but he just isn't half the man he once was to me. I also just get annoyed because he's pushing anyone away that isn't me even though the literal day before I moved out, he left a note and just up and left us all. I saw how badly it broke my step mom's heart, we had no idea where he went or if he was okay. I had to be the one to beg my grandma to tell me if she knew where he was and tell her all the things he's been doing to his own family. He tried to apologize for all of that but I told him I wouldn't forgive him till he got therapy. He never did and I still try to keep my distance.

But distance these days is more for my own well being. I had a panic attack at work. It wasn't really caused by one thing, it was just a very stressful few weeks that hit me all at once. Now that I know the feeling, the thought of seeing my dad brings that up in me. Every time he calls me drunk feels me with dread. Every time he just texts me out of the blue to talk more about his paranio stuff, my throat gets tight. All the ""Will you do me a favor?"" Just drives me nuts. This is all stuff that just came up in the last few years as his health has been in decline and he's not in the right state of mind. I struggle with the debate in my mind to cut him off. I want to just keep him at arms length but its hard because he claws at breaking that boundary all the time, begging for that family bond that isn't there.

1993,yes,AskDocs,2021-08-30 02:51:18,introvertedfreak21,Athlete's foot or something else?,"I've noticed some pretty bad heel cracking on my feet closer to my toes. I did take some pics but I can't post them on here. I thought they were form me not scrapping dry skin off my feet that would fall off. One time I tried to pull at some of this skin and found that very painful, like ten times worse than a bad hangnail. My step mom suggested it was bad athlete's foot so I bought some cream form Walgreen's for Athlete's foot. It says it is clotrimazole cream and I am not sure if I should use it daily but I've used it almost weekly. The cracking hasn't gotten better. I forget about it a lot, to be honest. I also take Zoloft for Anxiety, Birth control, and Naproxen 500mg for my back though I'm working to get off of that and may see a spine specialist soon. I was worried that maybe this was actually some other health concern as Athlete's foot is just one of many reasons why my heels are cracking. There is also a lot of peeling skin around my pinky toe(the smallest one), that hasn't been as bad as the cracks though.

Detailed Edit:

I am a 24F.
Height: 5ft 0in
Weight: 250lbs
Race: White
Complaint: Heel Cracking
Duration: Not sure, at least a year
Existing Medical Issues: Scoliosis, Anxiety, Degenerating disc between my tailbone and spine.
Current Medication: Zoloft 25mg, Naproxen 500mg, Norethindrone .35mg
I don't smoke, I only drink once or twice a month, no other drugs

I hope this helps. The cream I use is white so I thought it would help to show the cracks in the heels.

1994,yes,AskDocs,2021-08-16 23:19:55,introvertedfreak21,Physical Anxiety Issue?,"So, I am a 24 female, I am 5ft tall and weigh at 250lbs. I know I am overweight, I've been working on calorie counting to help slowly lose weight. I currently take Naproxen 500mg, birth control, and acid reducer. I also have scoliosis which was what the Naproxen is meant to help with.

A little background, I work at a warehouse. Due to the pandamic, we are short staffed and I live in a right to work state. They make us do 12hr shifts almost every day and make us come in for a sixth day every third week. At the time, I had worked one 10 and a half shift, and two 12 shifts. It wasn't the first time I did that and in the heat of summer, I'd been working at that job for over a year now. My only idea of what stressed me out was the job in combination of my boyfriend buying a motorcycle and having been in an accident that previous Friday. He's fine, just bad roadrash but it still scared me.

Last Wednesday, I had what I was told was a panic attack. I had felt this tight feeling in my throat, like a ball had formed there. It got worse and worse, making it harder and harder to breathe. It got a point where I felt like I was drowning. I had ran into my boyfriend and that's when it all just overtook me, I started wheezing and was struggling not to cry. I refused 911 because I could talk and I could calm down but not enough to be breathing normally. It was a struggle to talk. My step mom came and got me from work. She gave me two options, I could go with her to the liquor store and she would buy me a few drinks or I could take half a xanax(she had a prescription for these). I took the xanax because I don't really like drinking alcohol much. After I took the medicine, she bought me some food, and in the maybe 20mins form when she got me, got food, and took me to my house, the xanax kicked in and I never felt so relaxed before. I never knew how much tense I really held in my body, no other meds I took helped me relax my muscles so well and it made me question so much of what doctors told me.

I had been told because of my back, one leg would always be tenser and never relax as well as the other leg did. I took meds to relax my muscles so I wouldn't be in pain. Everything else made the pain mild enough that I could ignore it. Xanax wiped that pain out completely, my muscles fully relaxed for the first time in forever. The next day I was off of work and I could feel how much it hurt to have that medicine out of my system. I mainly stayed home that day as it hurt a lot to walk around. I wanted to think maybe my legs were tired because I had worked an 8 and a half hour shift before my panic attack. The next two days after, I was just pretty sore but managed fine. The Sunday morning was different, I had to work that morning. I could feel that tight feeling in my throat again so I thought it wouldn't hurt to take just half a xanax before work. It was the best I was able to work ever. Nothing hurt, I did feel mildly sleepy but it was no worse than my usual tired(I had to wake up at 6:45 that morning), the sleepy feeling went away with time but I could move with no pain. My fingers didn't hurt form folding tons of shirts, my feet didn't ache form standing all day, and I was just able to move fine. I worked 12hrs that day and I didn't start hurting till the last hour of my shift.

With all that in mind, I decided that I needed to search out therapy. I set up with an online therapy service that my insurance mostly covers. Today I woke up with my shoulders aching all day and just feeling weak. I was ready to just get this appointment over with so I could get some answers. The video call was set up, I waited 20mins for the therapist. Watched this little thing say she was unavailable then online then back to offline. I was later told that I missed the appointment somehow and that I had to reschedule. I was mad because I sat in such an anxious state waiting for this. I felt like I'd throw up and was shaking. I set up another appointment and sent an email about what happened to the support team. I decided to just give it a try of half a xanax again and a hot shower. The pain in my shoulders went away, I was able to breath normally, and no longer felt nauseous. I do have another appointment set up next Friday but I just want some advice on if this sounds like something else. I always avoided medicine like Xanax or strong pain killers because my mom was an addict who died of an overdose and my father isn't much better, he would only mix xanax with some alcohol which I know is the number one thing recommended not to do.",2,1,1,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='p5roem')>,,/r/AskDocs/comments/p5roem/physical_anxiety_issue/,False

I've been in a committed relationship with my 25 year old boyfriend for 5 years now. Since I grew up in the South where there isn't a large LGBT community, it was hard to find girls to date before I was with my boyfriend. He's very open minded and doesn't mind me trying to just find a woman to mess around with. I think part of it is because he wants me to get over my trust issues with women since I've had a lot of failed mother figures and terrible female friends.

For awhile, I gave up on trying to find a girl. This is because it was just hard. I'd match with a girl, we would chat for awhile and she would either just ghost me after a week or start making plans to meet and just never confirm a time and date. Recently, my best friend(25m) got a girlfriend who is also bisexual. She's really cool but he's made it pretty clear he is not open to her being with anyone but him. I respect that but it has made me want to try again because she is so very open about being bisexual and it was just such a breath of fresh air to me. I never realized how suffocating living in the south really is to me. I plan to move eventually.

Now my current issue. I made a tinder looking for only girls. I've managed to get a good few matches and I messaged most of them first. Only one responded back and she just stopped talking suddenly too. The others just don't respond. I guess I just get discouraged easily.

But a short explanation is that every now and again, I have dreams with my ex in it. Usually I feel nothing at all for him, sometimes being creeped out by his presence but this time is different.

Usually when I remember the dream, its just that I am aware he was there but this time, his face was clear as day to me, I can even see it now. I'm not sure if that's how he looks now, he most of the time had really short brown hair and clean shaven face when I last saw him because he was part of the ROTC in our high school. But for some reason, in my dream he had short blonde hair and a growing in beard.

I was invited to his little brother's birthday party(he was the youngest of the family though, so don't know why that is). I could tell he looked at me with this hungry look and I felt embarrassed by it but at the same time, it felt good to be wanted. I woke up before much happen and a lot of dream is lost. I'm starting to think my brain is just using him as a distant familiar face to express something I need or am lacking. I came to this conclusion because during the summer months, my current bf has no real sex drive. While I have a very high one during those months so it causes a bit of discourse between us because I want to feel wanted and he can't fake that kind of thing.

My perspective may seem off to some. I just never saw any real pressure to act a certain way till I was teenager, where my step mom insisted I needed to do my hair and wear make up to get male attention.

I informed my landlady that our AC was not working after we had been without it for two days. She would only tell me that her vendors for AC will not get out to me till Monday.

I actually had to reach out to her through Facebook to see if I could get someone else to fix it and she would only tell me to wait for her vendors and that she wouldn't reimburse me if I get someone else to fix it. I have send a message to her about what is wrong with the AC unit but at the moment, she has yet to respond. Any advice with this situation? My boyfriend and I have had to sleep at his parents house because we can't stand sleeping next to each other in the heat of summer. My roommate is doing okay, he just puts on a bunch of fans but I know we all don't wanna be in this heat for who knows how much longer.",2,0,0,0.5,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='o8ao66')>,,/r/legaladvice/comments/o8ao66/landlady_being_difficult_about_fixing_ac/,False
2000,yes,entiltedkids,2021-06-06 21:32:20,introvertedfreak21,EK pushes me underwater and claims I tried to drowm her,"Hello all, lurker here! This is will be short because I was around 11 or 12 at the time and I don't remember all that happened.

Some context, the EM and EK are two people my family was close with, EK was actually a friend of my sister and I until after this and few other events(her stealing our stuff and claiming it her's). EK is definitely entitled, her parents got divorced and she was an only kid so her parents would both buy her pretty much anything she asked for because they felt guilty over the divorce. Like, Littlest Pet Shop was the hot toy at the time and she had to have them all, every time new ones came out, she would get them. This is to give you an idea of the brat she is.

So, it was early summer, the weather was just hot enough to wanna swim but the pool was still cool. My parents had to work so EM agreed to take my sister, I, and EK to the neighborhood pool. Everything seemed pretty normal, we were all just being kids, splashing each other. I had been swimming by myself when EK and my sister came up behind me and pushed me hard underwater. I normally wear glasses so my vision underwater is useless. What I didn't know is that they decided to swim right above me so I couldn't swim up. I was grasping at anything that wasn't water to get back up. I finally did grab something and pulled myself back up but what I didn't know was that I grabbed EK's leg. She was above the water seconds later and I was apologizing when she got out of the water and ran crying to her mother. She claimed I tried to drown her so EM was mad. I don't remember much besides soon after, EM told my parents what happened and they wouldn't believe me when I told them EK and my sister pushed me underwater, that I didn't know what I was grabbing at. My guess is my sister lied to avoid trouble on her for pushing me underwater. My parents just said I should know better because I was older (I was about 12 so my sister and EK were 7.) All I got was a spanking with a belt. It was the last one I ever got and I never really forgave EK for it. My sis and I just drifted away from her because shortly after, we caught her stealing our Nintendo DS games. But yeah, that's pretty much it. Its not some big story, but at the time, it was pretty scary for me.",1,11,11,0.92,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='ntw7rt')>,,/r/entiltedkids/comments/ntw7rt/ek_pushes_me_underwater_and_claims_i_tried_to/,False
2001,yes,Advice,2021-06-01 21:19:38,introvertedfreak21,Unsure on reconnecting with my older half-sister,"Hi, I'm a 23 female and this is gonna be kinda long.

Some back story first to get a full picture. My sister and I share a mom but not a dad and have a six year age gap. My parents split when I was 3 in an ugly divorce. My dad choose to try and be a part of my life still and I think my sister resented that because her dad just left. My dad tried his best to also be a father to her, he did help raise her with my mom before the divorce but she didn't want him as a dad after the divorce. 

Up until I was 11, I lived with my mom and sister. Most of the memories are blurry to me as I was forced to take heavy medication for ADHD.  When I was 11, my dad got custody because my mother was a drug addict and would let my sister and I live in filth. It was bad, as in cat feces and empty pill bottles all over the floors, flea infested beds, I even found an old report card form my time there were I had missed 93 days of school. We lived in a house my grandfather owned, once he came to live with us, he helped get rid of most of the cats, cleaned the house up, and helped take care of my sister and I. Since she was so much older, when my sister was home, she would either take care of me or completely shut me out. Most times it was my grandfather but he had to work a lot and this was all because my mom would just sleep all day. My grandfather wasn't without his vices too but they were much more minor, just stuff like some pot or beer when he wasn't working. That was all just to give an idea of the kinda home I had then. 

When I was 13, my dad managed to ween me off the meds enough that the doctors said I could completely stop taking them, he let me make that choice and I stopped taking them, I couldn't stand them. They made me feel less me, like I was a watered down version of myself that could only really think all the time. Shortly after that, I remembered parts of how bad living with my mom was. I remembered how bad it was and living with my dad made me realize that wasn't normal. I thought that my mom needed help, a push to make herself better. So, I cut contact with her until she got sober. I kept in contact with my grandfather and sister for a few months after but seeing them just made the decision harder. They would talk about how good she was doing and that I should come see her, trying to make me feel guilty. More than anything, they blamed it all on my dad. I had to cut contact with them too.

When I was 15, almost 16, I decided to reach out to them again. It was because I wanted to know more about my mom and hope she was better. It was emotional to say the least. What I remember most was being able to tell who my sister and grandfather was but then seeing this woman behind my sister with dark hair and was very thin. I didn't realize who she was till she hugged me and cried about her baby. I didn't recognize my own mother. She went form being 300lbs to only 95lbs at 5'4"". She didn't look healthy, she scared me honestly. She looked like skin and bones. I know now that it was probably a combination of loose skin and drugs that made her that way. It wasn't a good idea to see them, I honestly regret it. They filled my head with these lies about my dad, tried to make me believe he was abusing me(I had bad ance that he would pop sometimes which hurt but it wasn't abuse) and just all these nasty things. My mom ended up calling child.protective services on my dad. After my dad got me back home, he talked to me about what happened and helped me see that my mom and sister just used me to hurt him again and what they said wasn't true. I decided to cut contact again after that happened.

A year passed and with it, so did my mom. She died of s drug overdose and that fact ripped me up inside. I believed so heavily that one day she would overcome her addiction so we could have a healthy relationship, I really wanted to believe she loved me more than drugs so to die in such a manner hurt. I remember the morning my dad told me, he work me up after my stepsister left for school, made my favorite breakfast sandwich and sat at the table. As soon as he told me, I just broke down in tears. I still tear up thinking about it. He let me stay home from school so I could process my feelings. That Saturday, we went to see my sister and grandfather to mourn with them. I wanted to see my uncle too but he was inside so I left my dad's side to go see my uncle. I talk to him when my sister came in the room. I gave him a hug and my sister joined the hug. Then she whispered in my ear how my mom couldn't live without her baby. She put the thought in my head that my mom's death might not have been an accident. I ran back to my dad crying, told him what my sister said and we went home after that. We went to the funeral, sitting away from my sister and grandfather while it happened. I cried the whole funeral, it was just hard to accept she was gone and I struggled for years on how to accept her death and how she died. I eventually accepted that her death was an accident and that there was no deeper meaning behind it. My sister blamed my dad for her death and why I didn't talk to her anymore. She would every now and again send me a message on facebook about her missing me and how my dad was keeping us apart like he controlled me.

My dad is no saint though. He was a great dad for most of my life but in the end, he made mistakes too. I felt more like just a tool while living with him and my step mom. She treated me like a second-class person, like I was below her and convinced my dad that I was mean to her for no reason. He always promised to leave her but never did. For a year he had a lot of seizures that was linked to a clogged artery that really affected how he thinks and acts now. Its probably best he was with her for that because she has a lot of experience with seizures and does her best to take care of him. I don't like her still but as an adult, we get along. She stopped trying to be a mom to me and has just become my dad's wife.

Now to today. I never had the real strong urge to reach out to my sister. She seemed to being going down the same path our mom took, doing drugs, dropped out of school, never got a job, and just lived off the money the government would give her and my grandfather for the three kids she had with her drug dealer boyfriend. Maybe I'm really just looking for validation on keeping things the way they are. I briefly felt like maybe reaching out wouldn't be bad if I set firm boundaries with her and just finally get more information about my mom. I always felt like part of me was missing, I never really knew my mom at all and only got bits and pieces about who she was form my dad. She was already lost to drugs by the time I could remember anything about her. I am just unsure if I should reach out to her, if I really need that kind of trouble in my life. Keeping out of contact would change nothing about my life as it is and I'm content with where I am as a person but reaching out feels like it might just cause more problems in the long run and add really nothing to my life as is. I might also just be looking for a support system in the wrong way, its hard to live life when the people you expect to support you have failed you a lot as well. Honestly, I only really have three people I feel won't ever hurt me or just leave me. So, any advice would be helpful, I might just choose to keep out of contact because it just feels like the best option since she seems so convinced that my dad is to blame and may be beyond reasoning out of that.",0,1,1,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='nq4xct')>,,/r/Advice/comments/nq4xct/unsure_on_reconnecting_with_my_older_halfsister/,False
2002,yes,Advice,2021-05-29 23:49:07,introvertedfreak21,Advice on becoming normal after leaving an adusive home,"This one will probably be really long as there is a lot to unpack. I am a 23 female.

To start, I moved out of my dad and step mom's home in December 2020. I couldn't be happier, this has been one of the best things for my mental health but I am struggling with it at the same time.

It really never hit me how bad my home life was until I got into a healthy relationship with my bf, he has been very supportive and helped me a lot when things with my family was bad. I would like to say it wasn't always bad, it was mainly just my step mom and I butting heads a lot because she couldn't understand why I wouldn't want to be more girly and blamed every issue I had on ADHD and always comparing me to my little sister, her daughter form a previous marriage. I had a good relationship with my dad and stepsister, it was mainly just my step mom I had issues with but it wasn't bad until we moved form our family home in a quiet neighborhood to this home far form the city with lots of land.

After the move, things didn't go well. My parents went into a bunch of debt to get that home and get it the way they wanted. That seemed fine because my dad had a job he was making decent money at but it wasn't a stable enough job, it was all contract work for putting appliances in people's homes. Things weren't good between my dad and his boss so he tried going solo. The money issues piled up, dad wasn't making a lot of money and my stepmom's job was only making sure ends meet, debts weren't getting paid. There were times I had to pay our electric bill because someone showed up to shut it off while I was home alone form work.

They charged me crazy high for rent in a home with three adults and one minor(my sister was in highschool most of this time up until May of last year). It went form 300 to 400 to 600 for my bedroom. I also had to pay my own car insurance and all issues that arose with that car. It wasn't easy, I could never save money because I couldn't stand being there. I would make sure to be gone every minute my parents were awake. Leave two hours before my shift just so I could be gone, hang out at my bf's after work just to stay gone, be at his house all weekend long. Just. To. Be. Gone. I couldn't take it because almost every night someone was drunk or high and the other was screaming. Some nights I'd come home from a 12hr shift at work only for them to have all their friends over to be loud and drunk by the pool. It was like living with bad college roommates and I was the only adult. 

I hated the holidays because of them. I remember Christmas being the worst. One christmas my dad threatened to not give my sister and I anything at all because we whined a little about some christmas photos. Even though stepmom made us stand outside in cold weather in Christmas dresses. We did it, we did our best to pose but we whined a little because we were cold. We were also 21 and 16. Another Christmas was ruined because my dad mixed alcohol and Xannax together. Most know not to do this, we told him several times that he becomes so ugly to us when he does. He did it anyways, yelled and screamed at us about not caring about him and demanded that I, his own daughter, go get his gun and let him shoot himself in the head. He eventually went outside to sit in his truck because we wouldn't listen to him, my step mom had to fight him to get his pistol away because we honestly didn't want him dead. We were so thankful the neighbors didn't call the cops form their screaming. I remember at one point hiding myself and my sister in my room form my father as he and step mom screamed at each other that night. Once he left for his truck, we were able to try and do Christmas Eve stuff together and he eventually came back inside and apologized for being ugly. That was the last Christmas Ever I spent with them, I made sure to get out before the next one.

Now, the part I need advice on as that was all to get an idea of where my problems come from.

I currently live with my bf and our mutual male best friend, Ron. Bf and I both come from small families, him being the baby. Ron however comes from a happy split family. His dad has two other sons and three stepkids, all get along well. His mom had two more kids as well. Ron is the oldest of 7 kids so he is use to always having someone around and people to mess with. I'm not use to it, every now and again I catch myself reacting to Ron or BF just walking by, making a noise, things like that. I'm so use to reacting in fear, preparing myself for a fight because my dad or step mom is home and drunk. I'm struggling to let my guard down I guess. Mainly just with Ron because he will just come by and touch me, just walk past me to get to the fridge, or make noises to mimic a show I'm watching. Its all harmless stuff and I know but I'm just so use to being combative that I have to keep catching myself from starting a fight needlessly. I know he means nothing by it, I know he's just use to having lots of siblings to pick on around so going form households of at least 5 people at a time to just a small place of three people is hard. I just need advice on how to let my guard down and stop seeing every thing as a need to protect myself.",3,2,2,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='nnz5qw')>,,/r/Advice/comments/nnz5qw/advice_on_becoming_normal_after_leaving_an/,False
2003,yes,relationship_advice,2021-05-11 19:49:24,introvertedfreak21,"Boyfriend totaled my car, moves in, and now might buy a motorcycle","I'm not sure how to feel on all of this so I'll give some backstory first

My boyfriend and I have been together 4 years now, we knew each other for 5 years before dating so he is someone I know very well and trust deeply.

Last August, I saved up $1,500 to use as a down payment on a 2015 Toyota Camry, I loved that car so much. It was the first I ever had a nice car. My only other car was a 2003 Ford Ranger that needed a lot of love so I was excited to get a car that I didn't have to worry about so much about having issues.

Anyways, two weeks ago, my boyfriend and I were heading home from work. We stopped at the nearby Walmart. It was dark out, we were waiting at a stop bar to turn left into coming traffic. He was driving at the time and I was the passenger. Lanes looked cleared, saw no one coming and then, out of nowhere, the airbags deployed. This woman came up on a hill and hit the front of my car. Her airbags didn't deploy for some reason. The accident details aren't that necessary to the story, just the cops deemed it my boyfriend's fault. I had full coverage so my insurance just paid the loan off on that car and I'm out the already $2k I put into the car.

Now, to today. For a good week, we were looking into buying me another car but like one someone is selling. My boyfriend offered me the $2k he saved up to help me since I had to miss a lot of work this last month because of an eye injury. He moved in to my place with my roommate so rent is cheaper, I pay nothing on car insurance, and my boyfriend does let me use his car(04 Volvo V7 with over 230k miles on it). Problem is that today, I told him I wanted some time to myself, to process my emotions on everything and just relax. So, he decided to go take a look at motorcycles for fun, he loves them. The issue starts there. He is debating on getting one and I'm feeling crossed at the moment. He said he would give me his car as long as I want till I save up money to get my own car. Ever since the accident, I've just felt hollow. I come from a very controlling family, I had to fight so hard for every inch of freedom I could get. They charged me so much in rent that saving up money was hard, I had to move out with the help of my roommate's dad. So, being able to save up money to get the car I wanted and to have lost it, it hurt. I don't know how to feel now. I'm jealous my boyfriend might get a bike, something he's wanted for so long after he totaled a car I worked so hard to get. He did offer to still use the $2k he had to help me get another car, I'm still looking at used cars but the waiting game is so hard and I'm just so drained these days. It also doesn't help that the doctor I've been seeing about my eye(the injury is still healing but I'm cleared to work) wants me off one of the three days I work(3 days, 12hr days) and I can't work my side job yet because they didn't send a piece of this welcome kit(its a delivery service). So, I'm just feeling so lost.

Edit: The $2k I mentioned is not my money, its still his and if I find a car for that cost, he will pay it and I will pay it back to him over time. Its more so just a loan form him.",13,1,1,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='na5wfo')>,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/na5wfo/boyfriend_totaled_my_car_moves_in_and_now_might/,False
2004,yes,offmychest,2021-05-09 13:53:16,introvertedfreak21,Never an easy Mother's day,"I'm just posting a rant really because I don't celebrate the holiday and it can be a reminder of events leading to my mistrust of most women, even though I am a woman too.

My own mother died when I was 17 however Mother's day wasn't easy when she was around either. She was a junkie that couldn't bother getting out of beds most day, relying on her own father and strong ADHD meds to take care of her kids. I'm thankful I don't remember a lot about her because I just feel there aren't many good memories there. Even still, she was my mother and I was never truly mad at her for what happened, she had bad addiction issues and by the time I was around, she was too far gone. A part of myself will always be missing with her gone, there will be parts of myself I don't understand and will always feel unsure about.

However, I can not say the same about my dad's wife. She is more the real reason why I stopped celebrating this holiday. One mother's day, about 4 years ago(I believe this was only 2 years after my mom passed), I wasn't doing so well that mother's day. I was excited, I remembered that my step mom wanted to make a blanket out of all the cards she got and I thought it would be great if she had this giant like three foot tall mother's day card at the center of it. I had set up the display for these cards at my retail job, so I looked through all of them to find the one I thought she would like the most. I hid it in my closet for like a month waiting for Mother's day, my stepsister thought it was a good idea and my dad did too. I thought I got her a gift she would like.

The day rolls around and I have to work that evening but I got the morning to enjoy. We all got up early to help make her breakfast, ate together, everything seemed fine. The moment my dad walks outside to smoke, my step mom looks at me and says ""You should put a shirt on, no one wants to see your saggy boobs."" I was wearing a spaghetti strap tanktop because it was my pjs, even my stepsis was taken aback. We mostly ate in silence when my dad came back and I went off to my room, upset. My dad checked on me, I was so hurt because I was never very secure about my appearance but it was just so out of the blue. Dad convinced me to at least due presents and then I can stay in my room away from her. We get our gifts ready and I'm thinking maybe she will like my gift and we can move on. No, she didn't like it. She seemed upset by it because she only wanted handmade cards form my sister and I. My dad tries to move on to the gifts form him and my sis to keep her form saying something that will make me cry. I was struggling to hold back tears, it was obvious that I just wanted to go cry. They show off their gifts to her and she still isn't happy with them. They got her stuff to decorate the house with because she likes to decorate but it wasn't good enough. She then asks me why I'm about to cry and before I speak, my dad mentions how today is hard on me without my mother. That breaks me, I can't handle hearing just the reminder that she's gone and just start crying. Step mom is screaming about how today is about her, I shouldn't be crying, all that. Dad gets me to my room, screaming at her to shut up. He tells me to just avoid her by staying in my room and that he's sorry she's like this. I start calming down after a little while and texting my boyfriend only for her to come in and ""apologize"" by going on this long winded rant about her bad mother and then says ""At least your mom is gone, I wish mine was."" I couldn't believe it, I just screamed back ""At least you know yours."" My dad comes in and get step mom out, asking me what she said and just utterly appalled by her words. She tries to apologize again but at that point, I just keep telling her to leave and when she doesn't, I just yell for my dad because I don't wanna deal with this, I gotta go to work in a few hours and deal with all the people celebrating this day while I feel like shit.

They all get ready to leave, going to get their nails done as a Mother's day gift to stepmom. Dad comes in my room and tells me to try and not let this get me down at work, that he's sorry for marrying such a cruel woman and that this really made him look at her differently. He talked about divorce but I knew that wasn't gonna happen, that's a promise he whispered to me for many long years.

After that whole ordeal, I have always refused to celebrate the holiday. I'll talk to her on the day of if I see her but I never tell her happy mothers day, I never sign a card for her, none of it. She utterly shredded any chance she had at forming any kind of mother-daughter relationship with me. We have just acted like adults around one another since. I know this whole thing will hit her harder when it comes down to my eventual wedding because I will refuse to dress with her, she won't go to a bacheloette party for me. That I can all do with my stepsis, who has never been anything but family to me since I met her.

If you read this far, thank you. I've had a rough year and this day just drags out so many nasty memories for me so knowing just a few more people out there might understand this pain helps. And for those who don't, be thankful you don't. Appreciate the hell out of the mother who genuinely loved you, the stepmom who took up the role of mother for you when yours didn't. In these days, real caring mothers are a rare diamond, too many women just have kids too young and for the wrong reasons so be grateful to the mother who you know truly loves you unconditionally. I know I'll give my grandmother a call, she's one of the few women I know truly loved her children and grandchildren with all her heart.",0,2,2,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='n8envo')>,,/r/offmychest/comments/n8envo/never_an_easy_mothers_day/,False
2005,yes,raisedbynarcissists,2020-04-07 16:20:12,introvertedfreak21,I think having seizures has made my dad a narcissist.,"So, here is the context to the story. I'm a 22 female.

I live with my dad and step mom since I was 11. Well, my dad never had any mental problems as I grew up but I do believe he took advantage of my need for approval because he would just teach me to do as I am told instead of think for myself. As I've gotten older, I have started to see more and more of how badly that affected my image of myself. I would get unbelievably depressed if I thought I hurt someone. I truly believed that if I am not helping someone, I'm worthless. That if I don't always help my friends when they are in need, I am a bad friend. It was so grounded in my head that I need to help others that I never stopped to help myself.

Now that I am 22 years old, I've started to gain more confidence. My father was diagnosed with generalized eplisey about a year ago but doctors believe it could be form a blockage in his heart making it hard to get air to his brain properly. He was gonna get catheter in his heart before COVID-19 really took a hit and his surgery was canceled. But before that, I left my warehouse job so that I could help him go back to working as a independent contractor. I wasn't gonna make.much at all since I couldn't lift anything due to scoliosis but I thought that it wouldn't be so hard since I was helping my dad and I thought he would respect what I say since we were using my truck. However, every time his boss yelled at him for something that wasn't his mistake(store damaged product but claim it isn't damaged), he would want to drink. First few times I just endured it because I wanted to help my dad. Soon enough it was becoming so often that I had enough of it, it was so bad he left my unlocked, running vechile to buy alcohol while I was in a gas station to use the bathroom and buy a drink. I eventually made a sign that state there would be no alcohol allowed in my vehicle because I just couldn't stand his drinking anymore, it was to a point I would drop his drunk butt at a bar to be picked up by my step mom while I go to my boyfriend's house bawling like a baby because it was just too much emotional stress. I was having to help him when he had seizures(he would normally have only two on stressful days but there have been times up to four and this was going form once a month to sometimes once a week) so his drinking on top of it was really getting to my own mental state and I was depressed being around him.

So, recently his boss has pretty much laid him off without actually firing him(just not giving him jobs to do but still having him employed) because my father seemed to have a stroke one night but refused to let my step mom and I take him to the hospital. Over two days, he was having really high blood pressure, to the point he felt sick all the time so I took him to the hospital. Problem was that the office lady my step mom called for him that morning to say he wasn't well was out for most of the day and I didn't know she only contacted that one person. By the time I was taking my dad to the hospital, his boss and other office women were calling and texting me and him to figure out why he hasn't been working all day. His boss took this very personally even though it wasn't a personal thing.

Now that we are all locked in our homes, I have been trying to stand for myself. I don't just do whatever I am told, I make clear rules for my vechile(which is in my name, had been for two years). Well, a few days ago he was drunk and high, wanting to go to his friends house right aftet I got back from a shopping trip for groceries. I was pretty pissed because he was taking forever to get himself together to go only to cancel it because my step mom was upset he didn't bother to wake her up and ask her about her feelings on him leaving. So the next morning, when he was talking about wanting to do shopping the next morning, I said ""I do not mind helping, I just don't want anyone under the influence while in my vechile."" Before I could even explain more of it, he turned it into me saying he is day drinking. I did not say that, I just said a rule I want to enforce for my vechile. It turned into more of a fight because he decided to say I have no right to make choices in this house because ""he"" pays bills(my step mom is the only one working right now). I even told him that he was the one to tell me I need to stand up to him to gain respect but he just kept acting out at me. I get what I said could offend him but he also said he doesn't respect me because I don't respect myself which only pissed me off more because I would respect myself more if I was raised to think for myself and not just do as I am told.

Now, its been two days since this happened and he's still mad over it. Its to a point that now he's having to ask anyone else he can to take him out to get a few things for the house. All his friends want money to do it so he's now asking his parents. My step mom won't take him because she needs to work form home and he seems to have too much pride to just admit that my help is needed in this house and ask me to take him.

2006,yes,legaladvice,2020-03-16 05:49:27,introvertedfreak21,Questions about the law on taking pictures of a license plate,"Hello,

So I'm writing this mainly because I'm still pretty upset over the incident in question but also to make sure I'm correct in the law about this situation.

I will state I live in Georgia. I was going to pick up a friend of mine who lives in a gated community here. He got into my truck but wasn't ready yet to drive off because he was talking to barber about getting his hair dyed and what dye to get. So I parked my truck on the side of the road between his driveway and his neighbor's driveway to not block either and turned off my headlights to let other cars know it was good to pass me while I wait on my friend to figure out where to go.

I notice this gentleman that was walking in his neighbors driveway. I pay him little attention till I see he only halfway crossed the street and is walking down the middle of it. I thought this odd and kept my senses alert. Its sunset, slowly getting dark but light enough to see in my truck to see me, a 22-year-old girl and my friend who is a skinny 23-year-old male, just looking at our phones and not the houses near us. I noticed form the corner of my eye that this guy walks close around my passenger side. I mark this odd and look at my rearview mirror and what do I see?

This dude just takes out his phone and takes a very clear sideways picture of my license plate. I get out of my truck and confront him about this. I'm a bit heated so I may have come off a bit threatening but I'm only 5 feet tall and chubby, harder the person to fear in a fight.

He tells me he had his house broke into a few nights ago and I tell him, I'm just here to visit my friend and gesture to my friend sitting in my idealing truck.

My mistake was not demanding this guy to delete the photo infront of me so now I'm worried he might try blame something on me. And to give you an idea of how much light was still outside, he didn't need flash to take the picture. I looked up laws stating its only illegal in a private area but I'm not sure if a road in a gated community counts as private.

I did talk to the gate guards about this and they said they would talk to their supervisor and hopefully, the neighbor in question but that my friend's parents would need to speak to a higher up part of the community that controls the security of that area. They also told me on how these neighbors had been acting off since their break in because they would call about anyone entering the community that wasn't a member and slept in their home the same night after a break in. My friend also informed me that there have been multiple robberies in that area so they believe its another member and I don't have any tags to state I am one so I shouldn't be someone he focuses on.

What I want to know in all of this is if it was illegal of him to take that picture of my license plate without my consent in that area? Because I'm not sure if it is a private or public space.",3,0,0,0.2,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='fjg0tr')>,,/r/legaladvice/comments/fjg0tr/questions_about_the_law_on_taking_pictures_of_a/,False

I'm a 21 year old female that stands at 5 feet tall and currently weighing at 188lbs. About two months ago I went to my doctor about pain in my right hip only to find out I was weighing at 202lbs and had scoliosis to where my lower back is curved to the left and my tailbone is slightly misplaced, its still connected but it doesn't look to be perfectly connected. After some antiinflammatory medicine, the pain went away and my doctor put me on a diet pill to curve my appetite which has helped me to lose 14lbs so far. My last visit I asked for a copy of my x-rays, something I should've asked for sooner, I know. I had forgotten they took x-rays of my hips as well as my lower back and noticed that my hips seemed too narrow for a female set of hips and when showing it to a friend and my father, both agreed to them seeming narrow and my pelvis is very thin, thin enough that having a child would most likely shatter it. I have another appointment coming up on the 31st of May to see my weight loss going so I was gonna talk to my doctor about the oddities of my hips and if I should see a specialist about my spine since my back and shoulders are popping a lot and my muscles get so tense that I can't pop anything and become really painful which isn't good since I work at a warehouse that sells clothes so I need to use my back. I have gotten clearance to lift up to 50 pounds which is the weight listed in the guidelines of my job but nothing more than that.

This looks a lot like procrastinating I suppose. 

But because it's my own issue, my own failing to not be normal like I pretend to be at work, I find myself feeling like I should spend hours and hours of my own time making up the time I spend frozen. 

I'm an administrator in an office where there's always people in and out but never anyone working *with* me, so I find myself stuck without a body double or someone to keep me accountable. I could probably tell my manager but my sense of fear about not being enough is paralysing. Or them not understanding and just saying ""well unfortunately you just have to do it"". 

My workload already increased since I took on another role, but I just always have a major backlog. 

It's getting to the point where my boss is saying they're worried about me since I'm failing to deliver outcomes for clients like I used to.

I want to be able to do it all. But will I just have to come to terms with the fact that I can't? Or do I need to start working from home on the weekend to make up for my issues? 

I've been in therapy for years but haven't gotten very far. My region doesn't have specialists in adult autism and/or PTSD. Even just a visit to an occupational therapist is around $300USD (currency example).

I work as the administrator in a cemetery, with multiple enquiries throughout the day. I was handling the workload fine, but then our funeral director quit so I have been doing their duties on top of my own work (admin, customer service, memorials). This can include 3 hours a day of arranging funerals. 

When I initially read the contract, I understood the reasonable additional hours to mean stuff like finishing cleaning up after a funeral or catering that's run over time, or having to finish tasks that got interrupted by an hour or so of filling in for an undertaker. 

But now my boss has implied that I'm expected to just get everything done by staying behind constantly. I'm already working through lunch breaks because there's no one else to take over while I take it and no structure (clients just walk in). 

At what point can I say no? The cemetery award is terrible for WHS as far as I can tell. 

Do I just deal with it until I find another job (not that I really want a different one) and run very far if I ever see the same thing on a contract?

Please help me understand if this is normal, because my neurological disabilities and autism mean I can easily be taken advantage of, and I'm really not coping either way.

I have PTSD and my partner has Autism. I've recently realised that they don't quite understand how my nervous system response of freeze works when I experience stress.

They think that it's like a meltdown and that whenever we are both upset at a situation, I should be able to just push my feelings down to be able to comfort them, just as much as they often do so to comfort me.

Unfortunately I have lived most of my life in an extended freeze response, with major dissociation. Which means that the connection between my mind and body is fractured.

It's like a massive executive dysfunction but for giving support to my partner, in this particular instance. 

And it hurts that I get stuck. Which I know hurts them. But then it ends up as a big cycle of hurt.

As a disclaimer, I have done years and years of different therapies with different therapists. I used to have absence psychogenic seizures but with a lot of work, I haven't had them in years.

I just don't know how to stop hurting them. I feel like if I could explain the difference between a nervous system response and a meltdown, we might be able to find more common ground so that it's not just hurting them more and more over the years.

ETA: (I always forget context sorry) one of our major issues is that I often have this freeze response directed to them in some way. Literally just walking up behind me while I'm occupied can sometimes result in me screaming in fear and shutting down.

2015,yes,intuitiveeating,2022-12-23 03:34:54,Vessecora,Am I harming myself with food?,"TW: Medical concerns = health struggle

&#x200B;

Could I get some advice on how to deal with urges to eat food I know will lead to pain and discomfort? I've had medical issues resulting from an eating disorder but I have come so very far from who I was then. I've rejected the diet mentality and I've found that hunger-voice that I had once silenced. I like to think that I've made peace with food, but considering my psyche struggles with anxiety and a desire to control/be perfect, I accept that I probably haven't.  


But right now my issue is that I no longer have a gallbladder as of about a year ago. Because of this, if I eat a high amount of fat I will experience pain and diarrhea. Yet I can't seem to work through the toxic shame and self-abandonment that leads me to doing the same thing over and over again. I try to listen to what meal my body might want, yet I end up eating (and enjoying) the same things over and over again because that's the only voice I hear.  


I have unconditional permission to eat these things but they hurt me because of my medical circumstances. So surely I should stop hurting myself? It's like I just don't know how. The comfort and the dopamine I receive doesn't seem to lessen no matter how much I make these foods available to myself.  


Does that seem like a spiral of self-harm maybe?   


I struggle with executive function thanks to both autism and CPTSD so trying to meal plan or even just making the ingredients for nice meals available is hard. But then I feel shame about not being able to feed myself. Especially when I'm relatively poor and feel shame over choosing to spend money on food that isn't going to keep me satisfied throughout the day.   


I have a psychologist, and I have an intuitive eating dietitian I could reach out to (it's been about a year). But sessions are just so expensive. My government here in Australia does provide rebates but any actual work would have to be done on a much more regular basis which would mean I would be even poorer...   


I just feel like I'm going in circles and I would really appreciate even just kind words from those who know how hard it can be, especially when almost everyone else is stuck in the perfectionism loop of diet culture.",9,10,10,0.86,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='zt5cnw')>,,/r/intuitiveeating/comments/zt5cnw/am_i_harming_myself_with_food/,False

&#x200B;

I work at a crematorium.  


Now this crematorium has memorial gardens. My job is sell the sites, administration, and customer service. I like to think I'm pretty good at it. The figures definitely show an upward trend since I started 4 months ago.   


But this crematorium also has a cemetery out front.  


The division is the car park, where there are council signs giving the name of the cemetery. People constantly call or walk in asking about sites or maintenance or help finding grandma in the cemetery.  


All I can do is explain that the council controls the cemetery side (maintanence, burials, memorials, and records) and give them their office number to call. If they're nice and the enquiry is quick I'll do it for them. Usually for the nice old ducks looking to visit a friend they haven't been to visit in years. But it's definitely difficult to gauge whether they're talking about the memorial gardens or the cemetery. Especially over the phone since trying to figure out where to start asking questions is hard for me being autistic. I can only desperately hope I don't seem rude!  


There is one particular middle aged woman who doesn't seem to get it, despite multiple explanations. This lady wants to put her mother's ashes with her father's. But since I don't work for the cemetery I can't help her.   


I've directed her to the council a few times but last week she came back in to ask why we hadn't put her mother's ashes into the wall niche yet. Again I tried to explain but she just stared going off. About my tone, about my lack of professionalism, about how disrespectful I'm being.  


Lady, sneering, and interrupting my trying-to-be-helpful explanation: ""How old are you?""  


Me: ""Sorry?""  


Lady: ""I asked, how old are you? Hm?!""  


Me: ""Oh er 28?""  


Lady: ""You're too young for this job. I bet you haven't even lost anyone in your life! No wonder you're so damned disrespectful.""  


Me, getting angry and loud since it's so fresh: ""Well actually I lost my father 6 months ago. His memorial happens to be here in the gardens. The gardens that I work in. Not the cemetery. I don't work for the cemetery.""  


Lady: ""Where's your manager? If you people don't do your jobs I'm going to call the police! You just better do your fucking job or I'll take legal action! It's been weeks. You don't know how to treat people. It's disgusting how you're holding my mother's ashes hostage!""  


Me: ""Look I completely understand that. It's horrible that you haven't been able to lay her ashes to rest and say goodbye but I really can't help you. And my manager is off site at the moment but I'll give you his number.""

&#x200B;

Lady: ""I must say your tone has been completely disrespectful. You sound like you don't give a damn.""

&#x200B;

Me, writing my manager's direct number on a business card: ""Oh I'm sorry... I have autism so that's probably why. I truly don't mean to sound-""

2022,yes,ptsd,2022-07-28 05:13:13,Vessecora,I'm freaking out about losing my job - I can't handle on call duties on top of my 9-5,"Today I disclosed my PTSD diagnosis to my boss. I work in death care, and luckily the nature of the job hasn't bothered me so far. But I'm worried that if I work on call (albeit for one week out of the month) after also working 9-5pm, as he expects, I will have a mental breakdown. 

The response was basically that I must as there is no budget to hire anyone else to do it.

I'm still on new employee probation so I'm trying to keep it together as long as I can but I'm so very anxious that I'll end up hurting my health. Especially since I have a history of Psychogenic seizures with a trigger of stress. 

My therapist moved and I'm waiting for an appointment with a new one but that isn't until late next month.

I know I can ask for accommodations etc but if that's just the job then I guess I'm not the right person for it. I don't want to lose my job though. I was told that I would only be on call for emergency staffing. I didn't realise that would be a whole week at a time. Plus 24 hours on the weekend. 

It's all new management here so although the person who worked in my role before didn't do the on call work, I don't think that changes my situation.

I'm freaking out a bit because the 9-5 job is the best job I've ever had and the income is helping me claw my way out of being poor and all the stressors that come with that. I can't seem to be able to tell whether the expectations for this job are reasonable because I'm so anxious.

I've never had an on call job before so I tried it. But I have PTSD. I know now that to be on call is going to lead to a mental breakdown because of the hypervigilance. There was at least one call every night except one. It takes at least 2 hours each time.

I need to sit down with my manager to tell them but I'm uncertain of how to word it to potentially get the best outcome.

The majority of the job is managing the office and selling/organising memorials. But my manager is giving me so many other duties. I'm getting overwhelmed. And that's not even anything to do with the realities of death care, just the responsibilities that are getting piled on me.  


I'm expected to set up catering, help with funerals, help with memorials for a few hours on weekends (on occasion if needed) AND be on-call to go out and perform transfers every 3rd week... And if there's no one left to do a transfer through the day, then it also falls to me.  


If it was just the 9-5 office management with only assisting whoever is doing catering and setting up the tech for the funerals, that would be fine. Although the filing system is all paper based which does make it harder.   


But being expected to do my job 9-5 and then potentially have to go out on transfers after hours for hours on end? Even if I get a later start after a late night transfer I just don't know if I can handle it all.  


My husband is already doing the on-call transfer duties during the nights and weekends every 3rd week so that is making the situation even worse because it interrupts my sleep since we have to share a bed. Realistically we only have one week as a couple where we don't have on-call duties and can, for example, go out for dinner.  


When I spoke to my employer about whether there are other (casual) staff members who could be called on to do the duty, she said that there's no room in the budget.  


That just makes me worried that they're trying to get as much work out of me as possible and also that if I try to set any boundaries I'll just be let go because I'm still on a new employee probation.  


I actually really love the idea of the job. Just not all the other expectations on top. I find it difficult to gauge what is a realistic amount of responsibilities since I have Generalised Anxiety Disorder and am constantly overthinking.

Prior to that I was a first year full-time 'mature age' law student with a background in administration and legal assistance. But since my finances are so poor as a student; we physically and financially helped my partner's mother out of DV; the rent has increased 40% since 2020; and my 21 year old car is giving out on me, I decided to take a couple years of approved break to get back into the workforce for the first time since the pandemic started. 

Yesterday I had my first great interview out of many uninspiring ones, so I'm actually pretty hopeful for once. They said they would finish the hiring process by Friday. 

Today I got the call from the hospital saying that my 95 year old dad (who has covid and bucket full of prior chronic conditions) is going into palliative care, can no longer speak, can't really respond, and is barely able to breathe on his own.

I just... I really need this job and I don't want to flunk out because of grief if he passes. He's told me that he's worried about me not having money and I wish I could let him know I'll be okay. 

I know I've only been applying for work in law and administration but I really don't know if I have the physical and mental capacity to deal with casual nightfill at the supermarket or entry level McDonald's jobs since those are the main employers in my area. I used to deliver pizzas during study but I definitely can't do that now with my car as it is.

Apparently my uncle called me lazy because I don't have a job yet while on the phone to my 90-year-old mum last month but he's not exactly here to be the one dealing with nursing homes, welfare, power of attorney etc. And I can't help but feel like it's extra unfair because I'm 26 (my mum and dad are my grandparents who adopted me) and still trying to work through the trauma of my bio-mum passing (my bio-father only gave child support so wasn't in my life) and my half-brother sexually abusing me while I was underage.

And I can't help but think about all the people who complain about ""the lazy poor"" or ""dole bludgers"", not realising or not caring that there's so many different layers to poverty.

Our next door neighbour owns a border collie, and unfortunately he's constantly at the bordering fence in their small backyard.

Now this is where the issue arises. The border collie barks at Atlas continually for as long as he's outside. He barks at Atlas whenever Atlas is eating, playing, or going to the toilet. Yet the border collie is quiet at most other times. 

Here's the part where I think I might be the asshole. Now I don't think I'm technically doing anything wrong by spending half an hour or more every day playing ball with my dog, but apparently since we moved in there have been multiple noise complaints about the barking.

My partner has ASD and anxiety so he's always worrying about the noise since our dog's presence is the trigger. He thinks I'm being an asshole to our other neighbours for not keeping Atlas' backyard presence to a minimum, considering the situation.

I was speaking to one of our other neighbours about the noise complaints. Both of us agreed that it was warranted. But when I mentioned the above situation, they agreed with my partner and said that we should just take him to the dog park every day instead of once a week so I'm not being asshole by making it worse (paraphrasing, of course). 

I don't know... I just feel like I should be able to enjoy the use of the backyard without having to hear or worry about the near constant barking. I personally have not submitted a noise complaint. We are renting though, so any complaint from others that accidentally adds our address gets back to the real estate, which is part of why my partner is so concerned that he'll only take Atlas out for the essentials as this has actually happened.

I think he needs ADHD treatment.,"I'm starting to wonder if my husband's diagnosed depression is more to do with his ADHD than depression. The symptoms he explains as depression are intrusive thoughts and not being able to do anything. The latter could be apathy, but the longer we're together the more I've come to suspect that it's more likely an issue with executive function and emotional regulation. Especially since he also has ASD.

Does anyone think it would be worth encouraging him to get more treatment with this in mind?

It was a fair few years ago that he first sought treatment and I feel like the standard of care has increased since then (with the right provider, of course). But I'm unsure whether my idea of more treatment is rooted in my own desire for control since I've fallen into a translation sort of role for him. He often looks to me to explain psychological matters in a way we both know he will understand and the treatment he received was before we were together.

I'm just looking for a bit of perspective from people who understand how ADHD relates to his life.

I only do it with those I feel safe with.

For example:

""Jess wants some chicken for dinner""

Or

""Jess is cute in this dress""

I've only just begun exploring dissociation as a symptom. There are so many behaviours and thoughts that I'm slowly being able to give a label to!

I saw a few therapists intermittently for a few years but it wasn't until 2017 when my current psychologist basically said to me gently that all the experiences I'm reporting are the result of CPTSD. I remember telling the kids at school that my mum died and just saying ""it's okay though because I don't remember her.""

Now I don't remember much at all. My memory seems to be related to emotions and catalogued events like school years.

I'm also in recovery from an eating disorder I developed at 16 due to the trauma. And I've only just begun working with a specialist.

I did everything: Troubleshooting my BT device, updating or rolling back drivers, optimising BT parameters, removing other BT devices, etc. Nothing worked.

I suspect her mother smothers and love bombs her quite a lot, I notice the signs from my own mother. I wonder if she is reticent because her mother is too much. I have been racking my brain the last 4 years on how to get SD to open up. In the beginning I thought she was a little kid and I would just give her my unconditional acceptance and love and it would come, but it hasn’t. 

She is quite outgoing and not shy at all, she just is emotionally flat when it comes to love and warmth. She never cuddles anyone, even our lovable cat gets barely a scratch. Is this one of these things where we just let her be, or should we have done anything different?

DH and I parent well together and even though BM is HC and a religious fanatic in a sect my husband escaped from that we are trying to help SD11 prepare to leave when she becomes an adult, the day to day things go well.

However, I have always felt extremely hurt by the life my husband had before he met me.

I was also very lonely until I met him, and we have describe ourselves as true loves and soul mates.

2085,yes,exjw,2022-12-23 02:19:59,MarriedToAnExJW,Translation of Norwegian Supre Court verdict regarding disfellowshipping,"As we are all now following the Norway case where the Jehovas Witnesses have been denied further funding and delicensed as a marriage and burial officiant, I can see that both the Borg, as well as a few lurking undercover PIMIs on this sub, are spreading misinformation. They are claiming that a verdict reached in the Supreme Court of Norway in May 2022 pertaining to a woman who was disfellowshipped gives the JWs a favourable legal precedent to use against the state administrator. The PIMIs are claiming that the disfellowshipping is lawful, but the verdict only states that the Supreme Court could not overturn the disfellowshipping judgement, as the DFed woman wanted.

I bring you the proof read and translated version of the summary of the verdict as well as the link to the verdict that you can Google translate yourself. Don’t be taken in by misinformation:

Summary:

“A woman was excluded from Jehovah's Witnesses because, in the view of the congregation, she had been involved in ""porneia"", which is a biblical term for sexual immorality.

The freedom of religion and assembly, which is enshrined in the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), gives religious communities a large degree of independence, among other things the right to decide who will be members.

The Supreme Court nevertheless came to the conclusion that the exclusion decision was not completely exempt from judicial review. The case was thus not, as Jehovah's Witnesses demanded, dismissed from the courts. Emphasis was placed on the fact that the decision had very large personal consequences for the woman. Jehovah's Witnesses follow a practice that requires members of the congregation, including the immediate family, to avoid contact with the person who is excluded.

It nevertheless follows from the right of freedom of religion that a decision made by a religious community with a religious justification cannot be set aside by the courts solely on the basis that it is grossly unreasonable. The judicial review of the Supreme Court must be limited to whether basic requirements for proper case review were met, and whether the decision was based on a materially incorrect fact or not. After a concrete review, the Supreme Court concluded that the exclusion decision could not be set aside on any of these grounds.

The decision clarifies the courts' access to review decisions in a religious community.”

2086,yes,raisedbyborderlines,2022-12-16 00:48:10,MarriedToAnExJW,My mom going LC/NC with very guilt trippy message.,"The text message is not in English, so I’ll post a rough translation.

Throughout the year we have been arguing and my mom is accusing my husband of being a psychopath and trying to kill her through gluten food contamination and me of disloyalty and abuse because I keep saying she is abusing me and being irrational. I have tried to keep the door open and explain what needs to change. The latest message three weeks ago has me heart broken, because it leaves me no recourse and is effectively leading to my first Christmas without her.

I wrote:

It is more important that you change the way you treat me today than that you say sorry for what you did when I was young. This way of acting, which in the article is called being emotionally abusive, that's how grandma treated both you and me, and also you me. It is hereditary, and I felt when I was about to start being with (my Sd) that I also had that kind of critical voice inside me. It was easier for me to do something with it and question whether it was right because I had an extra boundary since SD wasn't my biological child.

But many of those things you have done all your life and still do with me and it creates anxiety. Because it started when I was a kid, it's like the buttons you press are installed by you; one remark of the kind that has been used many times before creates a lot of anxiety. It's hard to describe, but now I'm trying.

People with experience of people who are like this say that they cannot change and that there is no point in bringing it up, because it will only be rejected. I've tried before with you, but you rejected it then. I don't think you do it to be mean; you just think it's normal because grandma was like that. Using guilting, i.e. playing on the conscience to win an argument or get what one wants, preferably with sarcasm and as a martyr, was very typical for her and is becoming more and more so for you. It hurts a lot. The same with being told that I constantly caused/ am causing your feelings.

I feel like I'm talking to a wall. Before, I had thought that if I managed to explain these things to you, you would listen because you didn't want to hurt me. Now it seems like you don't care if you hurt me. That everything is my fault, that I was just born difficult.

It feels like none of this can be said to you now. I think you are so in fight mode that you are unable to see any of what you are doing or have done wrong. I know it's hard for you, but I can't gloss over it anymore. Especially since you do more of this now and make small jabs all the time, presumably because you are angry and want to defend yourself. Perhaps a psychologist could help you with that feeling; it is not possible to enter a dialogue about change with the fight mode turned on anyway.

She wrote:

I'm answering now because I've eaten a loaf of bread I can throw up. From here, no more messages from you will be read or answered before I possibly get the help I need at hospital.
There is so much in these messages of yours that I am not able to see what is really at the heart of the problems because it changes all the time and there is too much to answer so that in the current state I am not able to keep up. I can't even reply to a message before a new one arrives!

To make one thing clear, there have never been conditions for me to be happy with you. You've had your own opinions about everything since you were little and I've been proud of that.

No one can take the statements about child abuse, emotional abusiveness and lies as ""implied accusations"". This has gone so far that it can hardly be corrected. You say I act like a grandmother. Have I ever reacted like she did when you had to take a year off because you were diagnosed with IgA deficiency (an immune illness, my edit)?? Did I blame you for not being able to handle your finances when you got anxiety?

I'm not angry with you, but you have rejected the few things I suggested as possible solutions and I won't come up with more things until the accusations rain again.

I also never threatened to cut you out! I want out of this house, so I can at least have a place that is mine where I won't be accused of everything . It has been very stressful to deal with this with the health condition I have been struggling with for a while and I have therefore been happy for the breaks I have been given, but I promise to deal with it before I can't anymore. I just have to get a little bit of the bee about my future first.
Sorry I'm not able to meet you on everything you say now.

He is often sad and angry at me when he is drunk. As soon as I could tell there was something wrong I wanted to run, because I was scared of him being angry at me. But I tried to ask him what was wrong, if he needed a hug or what else I could do. He said the had opened up to some co workers about his escape from the sect, his daughter and PIMI ex wife. I tried to console him that his daughter is doing well, all things considered, that she is slowly escaping the clutches of the org, celebrates holidays, doesn’t believe in Jehoover and just joined a football team. He cut me of saying that wasn’t what he was sad about. I said I was sorry and that of course I know there were other things to mourn and that it had been hard for him. I also said that I empathised when he said he doesn’t really understand how bad it is until he sees the reaction of other people when he tells his story. I said I too hate that feeling, as I meet the same reaction when I talk about my own trauma. He got mad and said I could never just feel sorry for him, I always had to make it about me… I didn’t see how I did that just by saying I understood how it felt to feel different and that your story shocking people feels alienating.

Do you think I said the wrong thing? What should I have done instead?

I have recently come to understand that my mother had undiagnosed BPD. After I got married and my mom started to display her jealousy in absurd ways towards my DH and SD11, I now see how much I have accommodated her over the years and it will never be enough for her.

I have been trying for low contact after she started calling my DH a psychopath to tried to poison her with gluten (she is celiac) and using every kind of medical issue to get sympathy. I am also beginning to doubt that all she says is true; among many lies she has claimed that I only saw my father one time, supervised, after he sexually abused me. (She knew about the CSA). Now I find in my old diaries that it was several times and the might have been unsupervised. 

I can no longer trust her, and she minimises my trauma (CSA/incest, 8 years of severe bullying in elementary schoool, a step father who mocked me and objectified my body and gave me an ED, no professional treatment received during childhood). The list goes on. She is sending me texts on how I need to forgive her and [how to overcome parental blame](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/growing-friendships/202109/how-move-past-parental-blame)


This approach adds insult to injury. I feel so invalidated and minimised. She takes no responsibility and I am a horrible person for calling her out.

2101,yes,blendedfamilies,2022-06-28 22:44:02,MarriedToAnExJW,Bedtime rules and husband always breaking them.,"My husband and I have been together 3 years, since SD 11 was eight.

Bedtime has always created tension as he is lax with her bedtime and frequently lets her stay up late past agreed and recommended time for her age. This spring it has become worse and worse and she will often not be told to go brush her teeth and  go to bed until 2215, which results in her actually not being in bed before 2230 or later. It has been even worse during our recent two week holiday.tomorrow we need to be up at 0700 and she still didn’t go to bed before 2220 or have lights out before 2235. 

I have fibromyalgia and several other health conditions that require me to get a lot of sleep. I know this doesn’t mean DH should put SD to bed before a reasonable time just so we can have alone time or I get my sleep, but I think it at least should mean that you don’t deviate too much from a reasonable schedule. I think this is to go brush her teeth at half past nine and lights out at ten. Most nights this will not let me get much alone time with m but at least I won’t have to go to bed before an 11 year old. Instead my husband ignores my many pleas to change this and keeps staying up late to watch tv or play games with his young daughter instead of making sure she gets enough sleep and going to bed with me.

Relevant info; we have SD 50 % and she is always tired when we wake her up at 0700. I think she gets to little sleep.


Am I unreasonable; and how can I get some alone time with my husband on the custody week or during the longer vacation. I want SD to get enough sleep, and me and my husband to have some time without it compromising my sleep. My DH only gets angry when I bring it up.

Edit: our common ageeed bedtime half a year ago was in bed and lights out half past nine. Now it is more and more frequently become ten or half past ten. This greatly impacts my ability to have any alonetime with my husband as I am usually in bed before 2200 myself, at least if I have to get up early next morning. On weeks where we have SD11 we rarely have sex and this vacation there has been no time just the two of us. SD11 is an only child and wants to be around us all the time, so after bed is the only possibility. I have no children of my own; but try to be a good role model for SD. I feel like I have given up a lot to be part og this family; and to keep to bedtimes and make exceptions only occasionally doesn’t seem to big of an ask to me.

2102,yes,CPTSD,2022-06-12 23:48:00,MarriedToAnExJW,Any hope for a marriage where we both have CPTSD?,"I have been together with my husband for 3,5 years. Since we met we quickly agreed that we are soul mates and the love of each other’s lives. The problem is that we were 33(F) and 44(M) when we met and have a life time of hurt, disappointment and trauma behind us. In the beginning I wanted to believe our enormous passion and love for each other would make us whole and happy again, but 3,5 years in I have to face that it’s just not that easy. He has kind of understood this all along and I have felt hurt by this. I have been afraid he would leave me if I couldn’t “fix the broken parts” of him. 

We both feel like our trauma has fundamentally altered who we are; he fears permanently but I hang on the hope that we will be more healed and more happy along the way. Firstly, since my trauma makes me suicidal at times and has in frequent panic attacks and anxiety; I feel that I can’t take 30 more years of this regardless of who I am with. Secondly I don’t really understand his motivation for marrying me and being with me if he doesn’t think we can make each other happier. 

He gets really frustrated with me every time we talk about this (its been at least 6 months since last now, but it was more frequent the first 2 years), and my inner critic keeps telling me that if I can never make him happy he should find a wife that is less trouble than me. He should divorce me and I will find a quick or even slow route to an early grave.

Before the covid I could go on walks and be social and if I paced myself I was ok, but since the covid I have been more or less housebound or bedridden. I am in a flare up cycling from moderate to severe from week to week and it is very much tied to my marriage and my emotional health.

 I met my husband before I had the fibromyalgia diagnosis and of course the illness and its’ effect on our relationship has taken its’ toll. We also both have CPTSD which triggers a lot of argument and we have also been unlucky to have quite a few problems with a blended family, my step daughter of 8-11 to raise and her narcisstic birth mom, toxic family members, a law suit about property damage by our neighbours etc.

The thing is that I feel like this life is too much for me to handler. All of the emotional ups and downs gives me extreme pain, insomnia and so much fatigue and brain fog. It makes me a poorer wife and mother and then I feel guilty about that too. And then my husband and I argue maybe once a week, and those arguments make me worse.

I love my husband so much and I feel a divorce would put me through so much emotional pain that I would loose all function from it, or at least be unable to get out of bed foreseeable . But being a part of a family and a marriage is also making me worse. 

I am currently seeing a psychologist who is also a couples therapist. I have tried to get my husband to go to the same therapist to work on his issues alone and then together in couples therapy. My husband doesn’t feel validated by the therapist and was disappointed that the therapist didn’t have a clear plan to help him after the first two/three sessions. He says he feels overwhelmed, understandably, but it is always me his irritability and frustration is directed at.

2113,yes,exjw,2021-04-04 20:07:27,MarriedToAnExJW,"Helping an exjw overcoming their sense of a lost life, youth and love","I am a CSA and adult rape survivor who has worked for many years to overcome my fears and trauma behaviour and regain my boundaries and freedom. I am not yet healed, but I have come a long way. Since I met my husband who is a religious trauma survivor and born in, now Pomo exjw, I see many similarities between my own trauma and his. I joined this forum to learn more about how to support my partner better in his healing journey. 

On this forum I see many people hurting in both different and similar ways as my partner, but also many people enjoying their newfound freedom. The most positive stories come from people who got out before marriage or from people who have a supportive spouse who either faded with them or allowed them freedom of religion within their marriage.

My husband was not lucky enough to have a loving and supporting partner that faded with him. His ex was in his opinion a last resort whom he married at 27 and who through her narcissistic ways only required pay check from him and his indulgence over her many irrational fears and ideas. Their marriage was a last resort for him to live as both a man with needs of intimacy and love and a faithful Jehovah’s Witness without “sin”.

I met him about a year after his fading process started and he went full pomo with a letter to all his friends and the Kingdom Hall after having met me. He was 40 when he woke up and has a nine year old daughter with shared custody with his pimi Ex. This has its problems, but we have overcome as a team and our love was deep and strong from the start.

My husband and I want to build a life together and be free and have our own child, but he struggles deeply with the fact that his youth was stolen. He is also very bitter that we never got the chance to be young lovers (I’m 35, he’s 42). He says this keeps him from enjoying the full joy of our love and life together, and he frequently feels jealous of people who did not have to grow up, date and marry young inside the confines of this sect. 

My husband feels like our love came too late in life for him to fully enjoy it. For me, as a CSA and rape survivor, who is now in a loving and safe intimate relationship for the first time in my life, I feel like it is never too late. I feel our love is healing, his acceptance of me makes me safer and I am so glad I finally found him. I have had to work a lot on my own cognitive and physical reactions, but his love allows me a life and love I never thought was possible. He, on his side, feels something is dead inside him and that he will never heal. However, when we first met and were newly in love I think this feeling didn’t have such a hold on him and I think healing is possible.

I deeply wish to help my S.O. feel the healing of the deep love we share, as I feel. I think I may not understand the nuances of his loss because my own history with dating and sex has been so traumatic that I am not as much mourning a loss of what I didn’t have as I am now exuberant over what I have gained in our love and intimacy.


If anyone has any advice to us in this situation we would be greatful ❤️

Edit:

A reasonable suggestion from many has been therapy. The challenge is to find a therapist thst understands religious trauma here in little Norway. I myself have struggled amd failed to fin one who understands someone (me) with high functioning c-ptsd. Therapy is not the only solution, some self work must be done as well.

The perspective this group has is unique and not much researched. Is there anyone else here that felt lonely and discarded and had trouble finding a partner and now feels damaged from it? My husband is a handsome, cool and desirable man, so I do not really understand how he could have been overlooked (he did have a few girlfriends before marriage), but I understand the Borg encourages you to look at other things in a partner than the outside world.",9,14,14,0.89,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='mk3ri4')>,,/r/exjw/comments/mk3ri4/helping_an_exjw_overcoming_their_sense_of_a_lost/,False

I don't know how I'm supposed to be able to sustain myself when I move out. My relatively low workload community college semesters are enough to leave me feeling burnt out at the end, and I need all the time I can get to recover from it. So adding a job into it to actually have a stable income larger than $25 per month from my parents doesn't feel feasible. The only job I feel I would be any good at is related to my super niche special interest that would require me to get a PhD to do fully (which is my current education plan.)

I'm not good enough at things like art, programming, video editing, etc. The more ""enjoyable"" work from home kind of things for anyone to even want to look at it.  And then more traditional jobs like cashier, barista, etc. I just wouldn't be able to handle the stress and social aspects. Ive spent the past couple years working on my social skills but they're still not very good.

What can I do? I dont know thats why I'm here. Professor and/or researcher in my special interest field is the ONLY thing I can see myself being good at. I'm not good enough to be paid for anything other than hyperfixating on it.

Melody was freaked out: she told our manager and our manager brushed it off, so melody did too and just made it a thing where “she won’t give Jack the labs ever again”. 

well, yesterday, melody was unfortunately at the reception desk when Jack walked in. he was being weird again and asked melody to come outside again. she ignored him while panicking and ran to the back. she told our manager that he did it again, and she said, “well i don’t want to reach out to his HR and get him into trouble.” hearing that really triggers me because my manager had done something similar to me a while back and i just felt unsupported.

\----

Through no fault but my own, I'm reaching into the philosophy of Software  Engineering / Development / Craft / etc. I've been doing a bunch of  research and came across an interesting line in an article by Douglas  Ross *Structured Analysis: A Language for Communicating Ideas.*

    ""It has taken time for us to escape from naive 'programming by priesthood' to more mature approaches"" (Ross, 1978) 

I'm curious what people think about this. Have we moved to a more mature approach in the past 30-ish years?

Personally, I wonder if we're actually **retreating**  back to priesthood. With Agile, there is the dogma of 'One Right Way'  to program. There is a current push towards 'Software Craftsmanship',  where programming is viewed closer to art (which, I know, isn't the  exact purpose, but I find this the understanding of most programmers).  Instead of growth towards more rigorous process, we're pulling process  away in name of 'Agility'. Granted, this isn't how everyone views or  practices development.

2. Is there a big jump -BEFORE- we start looking academically at software construction? I have trouble finding a leap from \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to UNIVAC. Any thoughts or would going beyond UNIVAC have little to no relevance.

About 10 years before that, we were seeing the ""next"" thing being 'Rapid Application Development' \[\~1991\].

About 10 years before that, we get to the birth of 'Structured Analysis' / 'Waterfall' \[\~1983\].

About 10 years before that, we start seeing higher level languages (Steelman) \[\~1975ish\].

About 10 years before that, we get Knuth and Dijkstra ('Go To Statement Considered Harmful'!). \[\~1968ish\]. This is the beginnings of the 'Software Engineering'.

About 10 years before that, we get to UNIVAC and 'Flow Charts' \[1953\]. This is the beginning of mass computing technologies.

The Agile Manifesto is dead.

These days, when you say 'Agile', it encompasses anything that isn't traditional PMBOK. Hell, even the PMBOK has embraced the value of 'Agile' in the latest versions. Scrum has become king and replaced the Agile Manifesto as the document of truth.

No offense to Jeff or Ken, but they have systematically destroyed the idea of Agile to make it a process of work. Enterprises adopt Agile in name only when they are adopting traditional processes. The first value has fallen.

'Stories' are documentation dressed up as Agile. If it's not in the story, it doesn't exist. Documentation is a dirty word. More people are anti-documentation rather than pragmatic. The second value crumbles.

We negotiate deadlines. We negotiate velocity. We track against metrics in order to produce 'on-time' and 'under-budget'. It isn't a collaboration with stakeholders, it's a game where the house holds all the cards. The third value topples.

Change is measured in story points. If a story point changes, we must justify the change. It changes schedules. We don't respond, we march along blindly. Instead of changing our work, we work our change. The fourth value disappears.

The principles are ignored. Customers exist as ideal user profiles. Changes are scheduled; bug fixes are ranked. Software isn't ever delivered, it changes every day. Business rules — everyone kowtows to the almighty. Developers aren't trusted and shuffled around continuously. Slack has replaced conversations in the name of efficient communication. Software is measured by velocity, not actual deliverables. We work developers like slaves. Tech debt has soared. Teams are assigned. Reflection, real reflection, has been replaced with motivational sessions. Each principle has been destroyed in the name of enterprise adaptation.

You must conform to Agile or you die. There is no room for debate.

I didn't know exactly where to turn - so I'm hoping someone else has a good place to start. I'm posting throwaway since I don't want to officially be associated with this if my manager sees this.

&#x200B;

Here's the situation: We have a fairly linear workflow. Work goes from one team to another. Each team has their own ways of completing the task. Our current tool only follows the main item and shows which team is working on it and that's about it. Each team has their own ways of tracking work within the team using Google Sheets. When we started the project we had a team of 6 people. Now, we're 45 and looking at continuing to grow.

&#x200B;

I've proposed changing our tracking system to something that can encompass the process and not just be assigned to a team. However, it's getting nowhere. I'm receiving a lot of pushback - the overall idea from my manager is that people should just comment in a free-text field about the status every time they touch an item. I've tried explaining why this is unsustainable, but the managers view is that people should just over-communicate and record everything. The process 'works' now, so it should just continue to 'work'. Teams should continue tracking with their spreadsheets and not use a common tool. We're at a point where we have a team member specifically following up with each team about high priority issues full-time. I've tried explaining how visibility would increase their view of items, but they only care about the team it is with and should just have communication when something is wrong.

&#x200B;

I'm currently at a total loss. While I value communication, process is important. I just can't explain why bad process hurts and communication isn't the panacea.

&#x200B;

tl;dr - How do I explain that communication doesn't solve EVERY problem?",16,12,12,0.94,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='ccilqh')>,,/r/agile/comments/ccilqh/why_process/,False

I get deeply depressed knowing that I hurt him but don’t know how to fix the problem. Has anyone else dealt with an issue like this? How do I fix it? I’m afraid he will get tired of me and just leave. I’m at my breaking point because I love him so much. He understands a lot about my disorder but sometimes he seems defeated. Please help me!!!


***UPDATE*** 
Thank you for all your comments and advice. They were very heartfelt. 
1. We are going to do marriage counseling. 
2. Whenever I am feeling a little anxious, and at my wits end. I am going to say Yoda time. Also if I feel like I need extra alone time I’m going to say Yoda time 20 minutes or so on how how much time I need. If I’m on the verge of a meltdown I will hold baby Yoda in my arms. 
3. If my husband feels I’m being rude, he will say spicy with a number that my tone is at between 1 to 10. If he is feeling triggered by my tone, he will say ghost pepper.
4. We will have daily check-in’s explaining where we are with our moods. 
5. We will continue looking at YouTube other sources online for more advice.

I (19NB) find it incredibly difficult to change my problematic behaviour and establish new, healthy habits. I'm fairly good at identifying what exactly needs to change, but actually doing so is ridiculously hard for me.

I'll use an example - I'm a very self critical person and this often has a negative effect on my ability to cope in certain situations. If I perform badly at an activity, I will ridicule myself to no end, leading me to vocalise my anger at myself and sometimes spiral into self harm. 

Obviously, this is not good as it not only hurts me, but drives others away too. I've tried different things like breathing techniques, stim toys etc to distract myself but I haven't had any success. This further reinforces a strongly ingrained belief of mine that I am incapable of improving which then makes me even less likely to do so than before.

Then, say that I told myself that I wanted to start going to the gym to improve my physical health. Maybe I'll go for a few days, but after that I no longer have the motivation to do so because of my belief that I am inherently incapable of making any positive changes to my life. That's not to mention the sheer amount of times that others have told me that I am lazy for not improving myself which not only doesn't help but further perpetuates this cycle.

I completed the IB Diploma last May. I received decent grades in the end, but I absolutely hated every second of it as it had several negative consequences for my mental health (which was bad to begin with), several of which are still ongoing. I ended up taking a gap year as I did not know what I wanted to do (I didn't exactly enjoy much) and couldn't focus on my future with the exam stress looming over me. In September 2021, I got a job as a teaching assistant as I thought I might be interested in education, but soon after I was signed off of work by my employer  (who has been extremely nice to me given the circumstances) with a view to me coming back to the job once I was feeling better after I expressed suicidal ideation to one of my co-workers. Recently though, I have decided to resign as I do not see a long term future for me working in education and I feel it is unfair to make them wait for what will probably be a lost cause. Moving on from this, my plan was to find work either in the form of an apprenticeship or an entry level role in software development/engineering, which interests me somewhat. However, my problem is that I feel things will not go any differently. I should mention that whilst I am trying various therapies/medications albeit with not a whole lot of success, I can't see myself holding a position or a role without the same thing happening again. When I try to send out applications, I start feel nauseous and a sense of dread. There is also no guarantee I will start to feel better anytime soon as there are long waits for certain treatments and doing nothing at all makes me feel worse. I live at home with my parents, and don't want to be a burden to them either. How can I go about moving forward from here?

There is this coworker at my job where I feel like he's making moves and sometimes he's copying my movements, he has grabbed my hand when he asks for a high five (look at my other post) and I can legit smell that he's into me. He has made me uncomfortable before and it's all the low-key things and a lot of this makes me uncomfortable. I have blocked him on social media, I have stopped telling him about my personal life. Earlier this year he has sent me two videos that made me uncomfortable which made me block him on Instagram and restrict access on Facebook. I told him I was taking a social media break.
I feel like it's my fault for not saying anything because sometimes I don't realize until I go into retrospect.
I am feeling very confused, it's almost like the symptoms of what you read online about the mental state of those who were sexually assaulted.

I told this to my close friend and she asks if I like this coworker and I say I don't know I don't think so. I don't know if I'm 
in denial since she mentioned it.

I don't know I feel like my thought process with this is like relationship OCD (go on Google images if you want a chart)

 I have been at this job for a year and he knows I have a boyfriend.

I love my boyfriend. I love him. I love him. I love him. I hate how my coworker is causing me confusion and taking my mind away. This coworker is very immature and liked to blame people and my boyfriend is stable and the opposite he likes to work. Sometimes. I get so stressed it's causing me intimacy problems I don't have sexual desire anymore because of my situation. When I have a good period at work where no one is making moves, then I am less stressed and I want sex and I'm less emotionally distant.


 This coworker is the main guy but there are a few others but I can ignore them and after a few times ignoring them they stop but this coworker I work with him all the time because he's in my department. This man is trying to take away my intimacy and I see his tricks but it's so subtle, it's hard to call out.

I am not sure if I have this but I do I identify with a lot of the symptoms: hearing people in noisy environments, asking people to repeat, having a good hearing test. Hearing in the phone is difficult.

I am technically supposed to be a 'native speaker ' of French because I started learning French at 5 years old and I have been low-key expose to it since birth but my family primarily speaks English and Chinese. I can read French at 8th grade level and I can write okay but there were some rules I never got down even when I tried to learn it myself. 

At work, I really want to practice French but my brain gets tired and I use English when it's something I find that's important. Even in English I have problems with differentiating sounds if I don't pay attention like 'beets' and 'beans' which was a real mistake I made last week 

I have compensated by asking to repeat words and by context and I do my job and communicate with people out of sheer routine. I can sometimes eavesdrop in French but I am still missing 80% of the conversation unless they are speaking to me directly I can't understand very well. 

I also have trouble being understood in French even though in my head I am forming a sentence that should be understandable but my pronunciation is very bad.

I feel like I should be better than this given my reading level and my schooling. This causes me to be very shy at work and it is mentally hard 

EDIT: I even have a similar problem in Chinese. I went to chinese school for 10 years once a week and I can't read apart from a few letters but this is a different story I feel because language attrition happens to immigrant children.

I am almost 24 years old I am really beginning to hate being infantilized by older adults. I'm okay with the coach/athlete type of relationship where it's just a mentor or an older friend.. I'm not expecting every older person to be that way but I wish I was just kind of treated with neutrality. I am a bit shy and I am Asian and I look younger than I am and I think I should begin to speak up for myself and my quiet appearance kind of causes people to treat me that way. Maybe I just emit a vibe where people think I am vunerable or incapable.

I'm talking about weird comments too on top of being hit on.

Last week I got a comment on how I was leaning on the table ""for someone to come up right behind me"" and I told the dude ""STFU""

But other times, I get into a nice chat with someone and all of a sudden it's ""I never had a Chinese girlfriend before"" ""When I was in Hong Kong I had several Chinese girlfriends"" and I don't identify how these comments affect me until the next day (which leads me to feeling uncomfortable for several days) and I know I should have done something in the moment and sometimes they're sneaky.

On Christmas break my coworker (Let's call him H) texted me that he misses me and there was a time where if I didn't say goodbye to him because I forgot he will text me or ask other coworkers to look for me. At the beginning I saw this coworker as a potential friend, hung out a few times after work at the beginning and now he's on my restricted on Facebook and i feel like I am going to block him soon because he sent me a video of two guys and a wife accidentally admitting she's cheating and the way he just comments on my every post.

Another coworker has told me to smile more until I made him uncomfortable and told him nobody can smile 40 hours a week.. why are you telling me to smile?

I try to ignore these things or just try to direct the conversation away. I never really had to watch what I say until I started working in a more bigger company where 90% of the people in the kitchen are older men. I have made the mistake of making a sex joke because I just want to be funny but it was taken the wrong way.

For example what started off and me knowing a few bad words in Tamil tuned into where one time I bent down and he said ""Oh don't bend down!! very bad!!"" and later I told him ""Dude, I don't think you're a bad guy but that joke made me uncomfortable"" and we didn't talk for 3 months.

I know I shouldn't be afraid of stirring the pot and I don't talk much at work and sometimes I end up talking to people because I am bored but I still get weird shit happening to me.

2176,yes,AutismTranslated,2023-02-09 00:52:13,Atausiq2,People have a hard time believing me,"It's  happens almost every time I describe to people NT or with my friends who do happen to be ND but not autistic, they don't understand and I pass well to the point where I can function well as adult and my struggle is mostly in my head now instead of showing up in my behaviour as it happened when I was younger. I met a lot of my closer friends as adults.

When I describe a few of my experiences they just seem to see it as either as a result of trauma or my parents falling short or both.. and to be honest, some of my behaviours were a result of their parenting style but at the same time when I got my evaluation and read it at age 10, it just made sense and knowing young made me adapt and help myself to where I am today.

I had a lot of outbursts as a kid and it was not really age approriate at times. Like at 7-8 I felt embarassed that I would scream and sit on the ground throwing a fit like a toddler and this happned several times a year. I felt like sometimes they were tantrums and not meltdowns but I felt my tantrums would last longer than other kids and I would have less emotional control. I had these tantrums until I was 12 and sometimes they happened because I was tired or there was just too much. Even as a teen I would occasionally have these outbursts in a different ways but my reasons as a teen was because my mom was very nasty to me but other times I actually was overreacting over a small thing. As an adult, I would go grocery shopping and I would come to my apartment and feel overwhelmed and had an outburst towards my boyfriend (now ex) at the time, I would have an outburst because the washing machine was too loud at our apartment. When I moved out of my ex's, I would go to the laundromat across the street and I would just feel overwhelmed over a little thing. I still feel that way occasionally at the grocery store or when I am shopping.

As an adult I just try to work on my distress tolerance. A lot of the autism is just behind closed doors or  going on in my head. I just know by just 'masking' with everyone it's more beneficial to me than to act the way I did as a teenager even to my close friends.  I have trouble telling my experiences now because it just sounds like introversion.

Teachers would notice I wasn't happy when praise, it was a 50/50 thing because I didn't know how to react to being praised but also I would just stonewall adults that way because of my parents but also I just had this thing as a kid where I would not respond to my name it this was listed in one report when I was 5 and I remember up until 13 I felt weird to hear my name and I wasn't sure if they were calling me even though they were.

I would describe this to my close friend, the outbursts or just other symptoms not mentionned here  and she'd say:

""That's trauma.""

""Schools get more funding identifying kids who are special needs""

""There are some parents that will just let their kid finish their fit and hope it ends there""

I just feel that it's hard to make people believe as an adult and it makes me feel like maybe I am not autistic. I am not fully diagnosed I just have a paper saying it's suspected autism, go to get further evaluated. My parents straight up told me I'm autistic at the time but later they denied it when I asked 8 years later. I have a sibling with a real diagnosis and several cousins diagnosed too.

I know my friends don't mean bad and they're not invalidating in any other way otherwise. I know I should not seek validation from just to outside but the more I talk about it as an adult people don't understand me. I found it easier to talk about as an 16-18 year old and I never got this type of 'backlash' maybe because it was more obvious back then. Like I told people at work at 17, they wre like ""ok"".

2181,yes,Tourettes,2023-01-15 04:03:57,Atausiq2,Masking tics..,"There is a Canadian TV show host called Roz Weston, if you go on his instagram there is this video called 'Tic Talk' and that is the best video I can find about how my life is right now.

I have had tics since I was 14 so it's been 9 years. 

I am good at suppressing them when I am out or around others. At home I would go to my room and go tic and sometimes after holding it all day I would explode and sometimes shout or hit myself. My tics were always minor and not very loud. My parents were sort of mad every time I was sick or needed medical help so after I was a kid and became a teen I would not ask them for help. When the school said I needed therapy at 12 for anxiety my mom freaked out. I'm pretty sure they noticed the sounds but never said anything. The tics were bad from 14-16 and 17 they calmed down a lot and I gradually stopped having them at 19. I literally thought I grew out of it. I would occasionally have a little spurt every couple months and I had them a little bit during the beginning of 2020 when I did not work.

They only calmed down when I started working in the kitchen. My first job was an office job and I would tic all day. I threw in all my energy into the kitchen, starting at age 17 and I gradually lost the urge to tic at 19 for about 4 years and now I have burnt out from working in the restaurant and chose a job that requires way less energy at a hotel. It's the equivalent of an office job. Two months after working there full time I realize I began to tic at home more and a bit at work. If I focus on something at home or engage deeply into a conversation/my work then it will either lessen or go away. I have never dropped anything at work.

I don't care if strangers see me, but I don't know how my friends would take it. I literally forgot I had this and a lot of people I meet do not know me this way, not even my current partner. It's really hard to suppress it and it is really annoying too. I relate to Roz Weston because I have a career, I would go to the bathroom a lot to tic in the past and it takes a lot of energy to look normal.

He said the reason why he called me was that my most recent employer did not send the record of employment. (EDIT: I filed my claim more than three weeks ago)

I was off for 3 weeks over the holidays and I was not sure if I would get enough hours for the next two months is that's why I applied and my job is technically a ""seasonal""  job. The agent said I can still work  at the same job while on EI until I have my hours back.

I worked only two day this week and now I have another week off and I'm not sure what the future holds until March. My paycheck for the first half of January was $480 and for the second half it will be around 300$. That's less than 800$ I will be receiving this month. I make hourly and my vacation pay was included on the first paycheck.

I will work a week at the end of them month but that paycheck will not show until the beginning of Feburary.

I called the accounting department of my company and I asked for my record of employment.

He asked why I needed the ROE and if I was sick or if I am still with the company, I said I am still working here and that there was no work over the holidays. He said ""Okay, no problem.""

He called me back, saw that I worked two days this pay period and said ""What period do you want me to make EI for? Are you back full time?""

I said for 2022 and he said something along the lines of ""What's the point? You are coming back full time. They're only gonna pay you in two weeks.""

I didn't know what to say.. and he just said ""Call them, then call me.""

Is it worth the fight? Is it worth getting paid retroactively? I feel like I'm putting a target on my back with my company and they made me feel weird for asking.

2205,yes,autism,2023-04-30 15:11:29,FRB2992,Had the worst argument of my life and think I've lost my partner,"Re posting from another similar sub, just looking for any advice. Feeling crap.

This is probably going to be quite long, for me to explain a bit of backstory.

My partner and I (both f 30s) have been together nearly 4 years, and it's been very up and down. It's been the most amazing relationship and human connection of my life, but also we have fought too many times. 
When we first met I was a support worker for adult and young people with autism. I'd done similar jobs for years. I thought she was likely neurodivergent, but undiagnosed. And together we contacted some higher up people through my work to start looking at getting her a diagnosis. She came back with traits for both autism and ADHD, but I guess it kind of freaked her out and although they wanted to continue with full diagnosis, she's not pursued it yet. 
In recent months I've realised, I have so many traits of autism too. It's been confusing for me because I thought I knew what autism was and how it presented, but speaking with professionals and just having some crazy revelations of my own. It turns out I'm almost definitely autistic. 

We haven't discussed this much, and my partner is of the opinion of if I am autistic then how did I never see it after years of studying and working with autism. Which makes me feel all sorts of squirmy feelings I can't put words to. I'm embarrassed, confused etc. 

So basically I think our arguments in the past have likely been from miscommunication, I really struggle with understanding human interactions and I guess I often act childish and highly emotionally in arguments or even just situations I think there *might* be an argument. But my partner says she needs an adult relationship, that I'm too self absorbed to even know what her needs and wants in our relationship.
Sadly, I guess she's kind of right? And when I look at the person she is now compared to when we met, maybe I have drained her mentally from being the way I am. 

I don't want the relationship to continue this way, my emotions get out of control, and hers do too and what was a silly moment of me not knowing how to handle criticism has ended our relationship.  We ended up yelling at each other off and on for nearly 3 hours. We both have said awful and disgusting things to each other. I don't know where to go from here?


I think that some time apart is a good idea, but I don't want to break up completely. I believe we can be so much better, the connection we have is so strong. But neither of us can go on like this.

I’m stepping more into my extroversion lately as someone who often fits the introverted stereotype.. being in their own world, doing things alone and vice versa. 

I do have some great people in my life but they are spread around the country or in different countries so it would be refreshing to make some connections nearby. Visit a cute little coffee shop, go around Art galleries, museums, go for a walk to the park, have a glass of wine or randomly choose each other a cocktail. 

As I’m getting older, I realise I haven’t been as social as I would’ve liked. Up till now, I’ve been focusing on much heavier things. Health related but now I realise it’s time to be young. Don’t let me grow up before my time!

**Some facts about me:**

• I’m a Childcare student. 
Not entirely sure which field I want to go into yet but preferably I’d like to support children with additional needs.

• I love to learn… whether it be about others, read fun silly facts, self development topics etc.

• Comedy is my favourite way to wind down.
Stand up comedians like James Acaster, Mae Martin, Jenny Slate etc. I like cheesy sitcoms such as The Office US, Scrubs, HIMYM, Friends. Dad jokes, puns, the goofier the better!

“Wholesome vibes guaranteed.”
“Human radiator.”
“Can’t digest glucose.”
“Weird taste in drinks.”
“Tea addict.”
“Old lady in a young person’s body.”_

I’m Autistic which means socialising is harder.

Yes, I know what you’re thinking, in this post my attitude stinks. And you would be right. I often feel I’m not doing any of this “right”. I’m not open minded enough and it’s hard not to face depression when I ask myself the question “what do I have?”. I have things to be grateful for, I know I do. I have a loving mother who is like a best friend to me. She’s my safe haven in a person and her love is warm, glowing, radiating. More like a sister than a mother at times. 

Even though my health is in decline. Recovery is possible. 

I have kind hearted people to speak with and shelter. A beautiful home to stay in the country in England.

But I do not have:

• A job.
• Motivation - most days.
• Trust - due to my mood rapidly changing, I often find it hard to trust myself which then makes me vulnerable and more trusting in others.

Generally speaking I guess I don’t have the things that typically mean “success” in mainstream media. 

I am flaky. I know I am. I cannot make firm plans at the moment due to how irrational my mind can be. I want clarity and answers.

I can sleep for 13+ hours when i fall asleep, but it takes me usually 2 hours to fall asleep.

Hes prescribed me Stilnox which seems to be Ambien by another name. I can feel a ""change"" im definately sleepy, i go to bed, but i still cannot sleep. I know i am not sleeping, my husband says he notices when i do because i will not move and my breathing changes, and when it does come on, it is quick, i will fall asleep mid convo with husband. Thing that bugs me is its still taking 2 or so hours when the dr said to me it would be fast acting and should work in 10-15 mins. Has anyone else experienced issues with sleeping medication just not working as it should do? Im still only getting about 4 hours a night and taking it earlier does not extend my sleep as i seem to wake up about 8 hours after taking it. Ive been on it a week so wondering if it takes a while to work.

The other aspect is he has prescribed me concerta, which i am happy about as I have awful executive dysfunction and i want to try stimulants to see if i can make all my thoughts stitch together so i can complete something. My dr has told me to take the ambien for a few weeks to rule out sleep issues causing my focus issues, but with the sleep pills not doing what he said they would either, im tempted to just take the stimulants.

Im next seeing him in September and he said to do what I feel works for me, but Im curious if anyone else has experience wtih sleep medication not working  as i dont want to rush taking the stims if its just a case of ""it gets better"". My dr suggested a month between taking them, but he also said that sleeping tablets would work right away. I feel a bit like I am stuck in limbo. I know i can take the stims now, he said that i could take them when i wanted but it was his advice to give it a month to see how i feel on the sleeping tablets. Problem i have is im getting frustrated because it feels like the sleeping tablets dont work, but at the same time i dont want to add another medication to the mix if a bit of patience is needed.

""heaving breaths"" in short, do i slow down and see how the sleeping pills work over the month or do i take the stims to try and get some semblance of functionality?

My question is, to my fellow peeps, do you experience ""bad days"" where u just wake up, and ur ability to function has just taken a dive? The day before I will be ok, theres no trigger, i just wake up some days and i can barely talk, sensory issues are crippling, and its all just a day where i cant get past it. I will meltdown constantly, feel awful and struggle with basic tasks. Its just a day i cant function at all. I normally write the day off and next day i will wake up and im fine again.   


Does anyone else experience off days like this, where its just the whole day is a write off from the moment they wake up? A ""normal"" day for me is a struggle, but mostly its ""moments"" and i function overall. On these off days though, i just wake up like it. tbh i dont want to just automatically say everything is my autism and if i can make it better explore that, but i am feeling so angry and frustrated now that i just wake up like this sometimes. ive always had these days, but i would excuse it away as a bug etc but i know thats not what it is, ive always known its not and ive needed an acceptable excuse to not go out and try and get through it.  

 i asked my husband who is NT and he said while he has off days, no he does not relate at all to this waking up and not being functional but he said that maybe my off days are worse because im autistic and thats ok. hes very supportive and im lucky that we run a business together so he tells me to stay home, but then i feel so guilty because its like the next day, without me doing anything, im fine.   


Does anyone else experience spikes in their symptoms as something that just ""happens"" and is it usually to have it fluctuate so drastically from day to day? Im wondering if maybe hormones effect it? i do seem to have more off days at certain points during my cycle. This kind of stuff the dr doesnt really help with, they just say im autistic so im going to have off days which is ok i guess, but i feel so guilty.",8,6,6,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='127ilgv')>,,/r/AutisticPeeps/comments/127ilgv/bad_days_vs_bad_moments/,False
2239,yes,AutisticPeeps,2023-03-08 12:45:14,FoxRealistic3370,Are food fixations/stims a thing or do i just have cravings? TW weight issues/binge eating,"Bit of context, im 37F and i struggle with my weight. I have always struggled with my weight. My Dr (who diagnosed me with Autism) has suggested that my ""cravings"" are actually stims and fixations but advised i see my GP for help. I am curious if anyone else who struggles with weight can relate.  


 Its not even unhealthy food, its just eating. I like the way things feel in my mouth. Fizzy is a good example, i can drink fizzy water and its the fizz that i enjoy as much as i do soda/pop.Its less the thing, and more the feeling in my mouth i like.  What I struggle with is when i try and diet, my mouth doesnt feel happy (for lack of a better description). I enjoy the food, i can eat the food, but i WANT so badly a sensation in my mouth. I try and replicate it with healthy things but I will end up binge eating even healthy food which makes me sick which sets off a cycle of comfort food and i guess seeking sameness.   


A good example is i love plums. I can binge eat a whole basket of them. I just love them. Problem is u eat a basket of plums, thats a problem. its not healthy when u sit on the loo for a week.  Its like when i have something i like food wise, i just cant stop eating it. Same with a drink. There is a fruit juice that i like, its the sensation of it in my throat i enjoy, its cold and smooth and i can drink 2 litres in one go but even then i want more of it.   


I have always been like this. When i was little i would drink pints of water (still do) because i just really like the sensation of liquid in my mouth and throat. Drs thought i was diabetic because i was ""thirsty"" did tests etc and couldnt figure it out past ""she just really likes water"" which because its healthy they just shrugged off.   


Problem is i dont seem to get a signal to stop. Food, liquid, its just binge. Ive made myself sick so many times because ive just had too much. When ive spoken to drs about it they treat me like im ""overweight"" which is fine, because i am, but i dont relate to anything they say to me. I had one dr accuse me of lying about my diet because i ate a balanced diet, and i tried to explain that i hadnt really binged a lot while making the diary because i didnt ""feel like it"". So she said i was lying about my food intake, and binge eating doesnt work like that, and i said to her that i either binge when i have something and get obsessed with it (like the fruit juice) and its all i can think about or i crave something and when i start i cant stop.  She told me binge eating was an addiction so it didnt work like that and that i crave the food so i said about plums and she told me that binge eating fruit wasnt a problem and wouldnt make me put weight on (but it is, because then i get sick and then i eat stodge and crave my comfort foods which is junk). Problem i have is that when i say what i do, aka the quantity i eat, the dr goes thats binge eating, but then they try and tell me what im feeling and the motivations and its not what i experience and when i try to explain they say im ""deluding myself"". So i never seem to get anywhere. I struggle to diet because it doesnt satisfy my mouth, and i struggle to get help with the binge eating because what they tell me is causing it doesnt fit and i dont feel anything like they say i do.   


So i am wondering is it that im deluding myself? or is it something other Autistics struggle with? I havent spoken to a GP yet because of the things i mentioned and anxiety about it all being just the same thing over and over, but I want to try again but dont want to say ""its because im Autistic"" if thats not a thing. I just cant help but feel like I need help with this as an ""unhealthy"" stim kind of behaviour rather than a diet control one.

its not for everyone understandably, BUT, its been really helpful for me. Some of the things my alexa does that helps me:  


\-Morning routine, she will turn on my bedside lights on low  
\-She has an alarm reminding me its time to wake up half an hour later by playing my fav song ""never ending story"" so i can wake up to something comforting instead of something that instantly makes me anxious.   
\-She turns on lights so i can just stumble out of bed  
\-when i was really struggling, she reminded me to shower, eat etc as well.  


\-every night she makes a fart noise (cus its funny) to remind me its getting dark (time awareness) and turns on RGB lights around the house so i have soft lights to relax.   
\-i use her to set timers for cooking, including timers to remind me to start it.  
\-shopping list, i can scream at her while my head is in the cuboard and i can SEE what i need.   


\-Nighttime routine she puts my bedside lights on (rgb cycle) so i can climb into bed and start to relax  
\-reminder to take meds  
\-i can turn my lights off by telling her ""bedroom lights off""  


I didnt want an alexa because i saw it as a media tool, but its really helpful for orgnisation. I think i will get a google home so i can use my calandar etc as well but we got the alexa free from someone who upgraded so not bad at all. on a bad day its ""set a reminder for"" constantly, but it gets me through and having the ability to do it the moment a thought is in my mind is so helpful.  its only the echo dot version so not too expensive.

2241,yes,AutismTranslated,2022-11-28 12:00:11,FoxRealistic3370,Loss of independence following diagnosis/unmasking,"For context I am 36(F) who was diagnosed officially about a year ago (thank you to this site for all the support). Things have improved a lot with finally being able to understand myself and my struggles. One thing I am struggling to understand though, is that I am struggling doing things by myself that I could manage before.

I have spoken somewhat with my husband about it, and he feels that because I am now aware of myself more, it makes it harder for me to ""suffer"" through experiences because I understand the negative impact it has on me. Is this something other late diagnosis can relate to?

I feel like it is a case of i did a lot of things before simply because I had to, particularly when i was on my own, I functioned, because I had to. I would shut down a lot more often, so I recognize that these things took a toll but now because I feel safe and supported, its a struggle to push past the anxiety and functional issues.

An example would be before I was diagnosed, I used to go to the petrol station, fill up my car, and drive to work by myself. Now, I feel a lot of anxiety doing any activity on my own and I will avoid activities and tasks a lot more to the point driving anywhere on my own feels very overwhelming. The idea of filling my car makes me feel very overwhelmed. It feels so silly. I could do it before but now it will be i just wont drive until my husband can come with me and he can fill the car up. So many things now I just avoid so I can have someone else do them or be there with me.

Do I push through this? do I put myself in situations that cause me stress and anxiety to prevent myself from becoming overly reliant on other people looking after me? It feels like I take advantage because I can do things but its such a powerful ""I dont want to"" feeling. I feel like my world has become more restricted because im not pushing myself out of my comfort zone but I also feel better day to day because I am getting a good routine and I meltdown a lot less. The price of that though is I am offloading onto other people. I have had some guidance from my Dr who says I should bring stress levels down as much as possible and a small world works for me and that is ok and its ok to need help but I did these things before, so I can do them, i just....dont.

I suppose what I am asking is if this is something other people have gone through, particularly those who were diagnosed later in life, that you kind of just sink into a phase of avoidance, and if i should be working to expand my routine and activities? Is it part of unmaksing to get worse?  


EDIT: thank you so much for all the comments! there are so many more than I was expecting and all them are so helpful.

I do understand that fatigue is part of the symptoms, but ive always had a hope in the back of my mind that i would find an answer for this constant tiredness and be able to function for more than 4-6 hours a day. I need to point out as well, when I am home, I can function much longer so I am sure its more environmental/stimulation based than health based.

Its hitting me hard, and im not sure if its something I have to accept, that tiredness is part of it and I have to accept it, or if there is a way to get on top of this. Ive definately seen,  since diagnosis and being aware of the causes, my ability to manage my anxiety improve quite drastically, as has my awareness of being overstimulated etc but im still just so exhausted. I work full time, I am lucky that I am self employed working with my husband so i have a lot of accommodations, but i do still have to deal with customers, no avoiding that.

So before (diagnosis) when I would hit the stage I was exhausted, overloaded and just couldn't focus or manage basic tasks without distress  I would just sleep. I would often get the ""you are depressed"" talk from the doctor and I would sleep for like a week non stop and then carry on. Now I am running my own business though, I am trying (so hard) to keep going, not only because I feel I really have to, but also because I want to, I want to find a way to get past these episodes that dont involve me shutting down completely because the fallout from that is very hard to manage also.

I felt like she was leaning towards autism because of the questions she was asking (my husband who speaks fluent spanish) but im getting more and more anxious because my friend is talking with a private english speaking psychiatrist for me to see how much private would be (because im getting stressed out and she wants to help get information) and he told her it was ""unheard of"" for someone with autism to be 35, run a business and be married and be undiagnosed......and its really worrying me that  Im going to struggle with more than the Spanish/English barrier.

Ive been told in Spain they diagnose Aspergers seperately to autism, it isn't an autism diagnosis, which is worrying me as a lot of the information I have refers to autism and aspergers being classed as autism and using Autistic Spectrum Disorder as the diagnosis. I am getting quite anxious and I guess it should be as simple as saying Aspergers, but I everything I have researched is based on the ASD criteria.

I also had a pretty big moment talking to my mum the other day, she said she had been telling my brother how i am struggling and he told her he had been diagnosed with ADHD and Autism in the UK recently and he totally gets what i am going through. hes nearly 40 im 35 so we are both doing this process much later in life. I have always felt like me and my brother have our own unspoken connection we just get eachother, hes one of the few people i can read,  and he is saying having gone through the diagnositc himself he beleives I am autistic so i am feeling more than ever like i really need to get answers but I am so terrified about doing this process in a country where they seem to be using a different critera and trying to not get things lost in translation.",10,21,21,0.93,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='q2ip3o')>,,/r/AutismTranslated/comments/q2ip3o/getting_diagnosed_in_spain/,False

2250,yes,AutismTranslated,2021-08-17 16:07:53,FoxRealistic3370,Can u forget your special interests,"ive posted a few times here and im really thankful to people taking the time. I have now booked an appointment with a doctor its on the 30th.

I am thinking about special interests. The problem I have is i KNOW i get super into things, but i cant recall the details of those things now. I am so sorry to keep posting here, i am really struggling to not just post 100 different questions because right now i am so confused and its all i can think about. I feel like i do this a lot, but i dont retain the info once i move on......when i mentioned autism to my husband and the symptoms i said im not sure im that obsessive in my interests and my husband just laughed and said he had a list, but does it count if i cant remember what i found out? i also feel like my interests are less about numbers and specific things. like i got super into natural cleaning and spent weeks spending 4/5 hours a day reseaching about the oils and ingredients, which were best etc but it wasnt like i could recite the recipies and i didnt actually do anything with this info other than talk about it for hours and hours. I really like microfibre cloths too, i will watch hours of videos talking about cleaning with microfibre, and i love buying them, and the colours, and i dont buy the ones i dont need more of that colour....i dont use them at all, i just kind of think i have more pink than blue but i cant tell u how many i have without looking. at the moment i know i have the balance i want, but if i see a new colour it will start again. i dont think i have 4 and i need 5, i just feel like i either have it right, or i need more. Are special interests always about specifics or can they be just taking a really intense interest and talking about it for hours and hours? and is it not an autistic trait if i forget what i found out about them?

I really like my cat, like REALLY, i will tell people about her but sometimes i forget who i am talking to and i will say and then she said, instead of remembering my cat doesnt talk, but i remember interactions with her like she talks, though i know she doesnt.

Im so sorry i hope it is ok i keep posting, im just so wound up right now. i feel like since actually thinking i could be autistic, i cant stop all these things coming to the front. my mum said she thinks i want it to fit so i am acting more autistic and i honestly do not know anymore. i KNOW since i was little people would tell me to just shut up talking about things and i recall a project about the rainforest at school where we had to write one page in our notebook about the rainforest and i filled the whole notebook and drew pictures. its stuff like that i do, i dont do dates or figures, i just really like learning about things and talking about them but i dont always do it at the right time or place (my co workers used to turn around and leave if they saw me at lunch kind of thing).",7,13,13,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='p66vtz')>,,/r/AutismTranslated/comments/p66vtz/can_u_forget_your_special_interests/,False
2251,yes,AutismTranslated,2021-08-11 12:43:19,FoxRealistic3370,I am really struggling,"Sorry to ramble, im just at a point at the moment where i cant look forwards and im struggling and i just need to get this out of me. Anyone who reads this, thank you but I understadn if its too much I just NEED to get this out of me.

Ive posted before, so sorry if some of this is a rehash. I saw my Mum yesterday to have an open talk, and she is a lovely kind person, but it did not go well. I saw my husband after and just lost it and cried so hard I ended up having a panic attack.

Im 35 yo female. I have always felt like im missing something, like everything is weird for me and that im doing life wrong. Always. I never really took autism seriously until recently trying to research what I was experiencing and reading of other women being diagnosed later in life.

What happened yesterday was I talked to my mum who i had already said i thought i was autistic to. I had asked her to think about things i did when i was younger etc so i could tell the doctor what I was like when I was younger. Yesterday....she basically said she didnt think i was that bad. she admitted that it was my brother they thought was autistic (hes not been diagnosed, hes nearly 40 now but he has dyslexia, and had issues speaking when he was younger etc so autism had been mentioned). My brother is doing well now, BUT i do admit where I am pure choas he is regid regime. He lives very minimal lifestyle and does get distressed if he deviates from his routine. Anyway, my mum said i should get my hormones checked out because she didnt see any signs of autism, and when i was at uni i was doing well and it was because i was on top of the hormone stuff (ive had problems with periods).

I dont know how to explain how this made me feel. I felt myself just give up. 

i remember being scared, confused and TRYING SO HARD to do what everyone else does and not understanding why it didnt work. this was my earliest memories, being scared and confused.  is it possible my mum just missed things? is it possible that i could hide it that well? i literally wanted to die by the time i was 8/9 because i was just so traumatised. i dont understand how for everyone else to do things they do it, if i try it my way is days and days of not getting anywhere for something that should be an hour, and i copy what they do and its still a disaster, and its that for me to do what they do it has to be 100 more steps and then im told im normal? its just life, that \*ive never just got on with it i over think and make things more hard than they are\*.   


I lost it when i came home to my husband, i had a full blown hyperventilation attack because the idea that im normal is so traumatising to me because there HAS to be something that describes this feeling i have always had, there has to be something that makes me feel this way or im never going to feel whole, and im never going to manage. its just going to be my whole life feeling like im missing something, that theres a step everyone does in private in secret and i just dont know it. i am terrified im normal because if everyone else felt this, if THIS is normal, then im just not coping with something everyone else copes just fine with. it cant be normal for every waking moment to be so full of thoughts and have basic things be so difficult. it cant be. i suffer. a good day is a day where i dont suffer.  


I cant see a doctor right now and im honestly feeling like i have no hope, that im identfiying iwth autism but im not, its jjust another example of me not doing something the right way and theres nothign wrong with me, im just bad at being a person.  i feel so alone. i dont know what to do. please can someone explain what i need to do.",26,13,13,0.9,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='p2cays')>,,/r/AutismTranslated/comments/p2cays/i_am_really_struggling/,False
2252,yes,AutismTranslated,2021-08-06 11:55:50,FoxRealistic3370,what to do if doctor says no,"so im thinking i am autistic. Im 35 yo female and it fits, and tbh i didnt think it was autism because i thought i dont act like someone with autism, but then i found articles about women with autism and how it presents differently and....its like reading my biography.

Obv waiting for things to calm with the dredded virus, BUT im struggling with the idea that now ive found something that fits, what if its not that at all and it is just me not trying hard enough.

i felt a huge releif reading the women talking about being diagnosed with autism later in life, it describes so directly what i have experienced forever. I felt relief because its not me messing up, its not me trying and failing, its that there is something different, which is what i have felt my whole life.....that i am missing something everyone else has because i do exactly what they do but for me it turns to mess and chaos when for them they succeed and manage and im just here in the corner fixating on a lost hoover part for three days.  But what if.....its not. What if it really is that even though for 20 odd years i have been trying REALLY REALLY hard to get the hang of basic things like keeping tidy, multitasking, socialising...what if it is just that i am failing.

My life is defined by did i have a meltdown that day. a good day is i didnt have a time where i felt over stimulated, overwhelmed and actually managed to function for more than a few hours. A bad day is waking up and everything is too much, too loud, too smelly, too many things moving, too many people.....getting my speech STUCK so i repeat words over and over and over and then just end up in the loo punching myself cuz i feel something i cant put anywhrere. What if its all just me not being successful at life. what if its just me....failing.

I am terrified. My mum on telling her finally that i think i am autistic and she said ""how will you cope if you are?"" and im thinking, but how do i cope if im not, im not coping, i never have coped. if im left on my own things go to shit....the one and only time i was on my own for a few months, i had a full on breakdown cuz i just couldnt do stuff, i just couldnt keep tidy, i couldnt get up, i couldnt regulate sleep or eating or anythign cuz id get lost in something like spending 3 days organising my cuboard, or looking up dead people cuz i had the thought about what real dead people look like (let me tell you that was not an experience i want to repeat, i could NOT stop thinking about dead people).

then people tell me just do it. just do WHAT? want to be tidy...JUST tidy up.....cept when i try i have to take 3 days and not see anyone and lock the doors and no do anything else other than tidy up cuz i cant do more than one thing. if i tidy up i have to say that day is a day i tidy up.

What if its me. Im so scared im going to vocalise everything that ive experienced my whole life and the doctor is going to say ur not autistic its just you.

(i have been diagnosed with OCD, that doc said she suspected im on the spectrum but getting a diagnosis as adult female (10 years ago) was next to impossible. but not anyone else, and i have been in therapy since 11 they said its growing pains, then they said its depression, then they said im not trying hard enough, then they said my self harm was for attention even though i hid the wounds from everyone but them, then they said its just normal life i have to get used to it, then i stopped and self harmed until i was 24 when i was diagnosed with ocd, then the punching started cuz i couldnt cut, and NEVER have i ever felt like my normal is anything other than suffering and distress over minor tiny small tiny things. i cant function for more than a few hours and their solution is antidepresseants which make me sleep 18 hours a day. i havent seen anyone in nearly 10 years because im so tired of being told its depression, how is it possible i have been depressed my ewntire life, how is it possible to be depressed but feel so much emotion i have to scream and bang my head or punch myself.) im stuck.",7,8,8,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='oz54m4')>,,/r/AutismTranslated/comments/oz54m4/what_to_do_if_doctor_says_no/,False

I am really needing some advice on how this was handled by us. Sorry its a long and serious one but im honestly just tied up in knots and need some feedback.

We run a computer repair business. We had a client come in showing signs of paranoia, eg convinced they had been hacked etc. That is not that uncommon and usually stems from a lack of knowledge. this client did concern me at the time as she was not listening to what we told her, and found new examples of perfectly normal things being signs someone had hacked her. Tbh its not that strange, we do get people who suffer from paranoia and we try and just stick to the repetition of facts to try and reassure them.

she came back today and said her phone had been hacked and it's definitely someone in her phone. I asked her what made her feel that (which we ask every client to identify if its confusion or genuine) and she said the battery symbol.....that's the kind of thing she is saying, shes claiming they have stolen her pension (but the bank said it was an error so they must have changed the bank records kind of thing). Knowing her from previous, I go through what she is saying and go over the facts about why this isnt someone hacking her. Anyway, she mentions she is being harassed by her neighbors so i told her to please call the police, and said when you are tired and anxious that can make things look like a threat, so i think that is what is happening. She alarmed me then because she said she had already called the police when she lived in another country. tbh i just reacted and said, but that is another country, u need to call the police here, for this, and she said ""they had followed her"". She went to leave clearly very upset saying ""she cant do this anymore,shes got no one,  they are after her and wont leave her alone"" she said   that they are next door but everyone says the house is empty but they are in there banging the walls all night. I reacted quickly tbh and got my husband to close the door so i could sit her down. she was saying she couldn't do it anymore, she was so tired and depressed, they never leave her alone. I said to her I want to call an ambulance for her, which distressed her greatly. I said i couldn't stop her leaving but I had to report to the police what had happened because I was very worried, and I would prefer if she would stay so I could call them with her here. She became very distressed and said that this had all happened before, no one believed her no one helped her and she couldn't do it anymore. when she left she was very upset.

My husband called the police who took her details from us and said they would be taking it seriously and follow up. The police did say that we had done the right thing. I just feel awful tho. I feel like perhaps i should not have asked the questions i did and cause the situation to escalate? I feel like when she said she couldnt do it anymore and they had followed her from another country that this was something more than someone with paranoi but im not sure i did the right thing by scaring her and calling the police when she had begged me not to.  Please anyone who could offer some advice or insight. I just dont know if i handled this right.

At a meeting over the weekend, Person 1 asked Person 2 if they played D&D. I, sitting in between them, said in a jokey way, ""Well, look at her necklace, what do you think?"" (It was a dragon necklace, FWIW) Person 2 nodded at Person 1 by way of an answer, then got distracted from any further communication with Person 1 by my commenting on their necklace.

When I'm nervous or new to a situation, as I am with this group, I tend to try to joke around, am blunt, and tend to interrupt/openly eavesdrop on others, etc. I felt bad about this interaction later, as it occurred to me that I inserted myself into their conversation like that, and I might have inadvertently prevented Person 1 from getting to know Person 2 better. Person 1 didn't act upset but seemed subdued afterward. I've since learned Person 1 is also relatively new to this group.

Now, I'm 46 yo, but I've never felt like I have the best grasp of what is super awkward and what isn't. Maybe y'all can help.

2261,yes,SpicyAutism,2023-05-09 19:38:20,linguisticshead,Ambulance was called on me yesterday during a meltdown,"UPDATE AT THE END OF THE POST!

CW: meltdown, ableism (?)

Hi guys. I am having a hard time at University lately. I am writing to try to feel better. I have been in bed since yesterday and don‘t have the energy to stand up. I don‘t know if any of you follow me on Tumblr, I spoke about this yesterday too there. 

I have cognitive deficits as well as language and speech impairment. Which makes my degree 10x harder. I have an educational psychologist outisde of Uni that helps me. I also have an aid at Uni to help me. 

Yesterday my aid didn‘t go. Which was fine. The first class I had was hard, it‘s the hardest one for me. Not only the subject itself is hard but the class is huge, loud and overall a stressful environment. The next class I had was also difficult. I was so overwhelmed by the end of the class I was shaking. 

After my two classes I had a short meeting with my Professor from the first class to talk about what texts I could read to help me understand. During our conversation she asked me „Do you even like Literature“ and I responded yes quickly. Then she told me there probably isn’t going to be any text that fits my needs. then I started to notice that she asked me this because she didn‘t think I should be there studying Literature if I have this much difficulty. I started to have these thoughts and I started to get overwhelmed because I felt suddenly so bad, like I shouldn‘t be there. I couldn‘t hear what she was saying anymore and I don‘t remember much from then. 

I hid under the table and I was hitting myself hard. I started crying too. The class tutors tried to touch me and that made it all worse. Then I just remember the doctor. The doctor helped me calm down. She took me to the ambulance and gave me benzos. They called my parents to pick me up. I have been in bed since. 

I don‘t know exactly how I feel about this. I don‘t even understand why I had such a bad meltdown. I know I have been going through a hard time and I have been more overwhelmed lately. But I feel so bad I couldn‘t control myself. And I feel even worse because I don‘t think I should be goong to University. 

Just sharing guys. I am recovering.

UPDATE !! (13TH MAY): yesterday this professor called me after class and we had a conversation. She said she was sorry for not knowing how to take care of me and that she should have known. She apologized for what she said and she said she had never had an autistic student with this support needs (didnt exactly say in these words but this is what she meant) and she also said the university doesn't give any guidance (which I know is true and am trying to work with my student group to change). She did recommend me some other books and texts I could read, she actually brought me her own book for me to take notes and read one chapter. This time my aid was with me and my aid also explained a little bit of what a meltdown is and how she could have helped. 

My country's government does have disability laws but the issue with public universities is that most professors are old and dont understand this right to study. The government unfortunately also doesnt force unis to apply the laws so each person individually has to look for accomodations they need and if the prof doesnt want to do it they have to get involved with a lawyer. This is what my autism student group is trying to change and we have made great progress in my uni for now 2 institutes already have their own disability resources and students dont have to ""fight"" for it. Most of unis in my country dont have a disability service which I think is usual in the US and Europe. My institute still doesnt have it but my group is booking a meeting in the next few weeks specially after this incident to discuss it. will update you guys about the progress we have made. thank you all for your nice comments they mean a lot. sorry it took me long to answer, it was a bit overwhelming to me.",37,110,110,0.98,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13d3niw')>,,/r/SpicyAutism/comments/13d3niw/ambulance_was_called_on_me_yesterday_during_a/,False
2262,yes,SpicyAutism,2023-05-02 02:23:43,linguisticshead,I feel that I am bullied in the autistic community,"This has happened multiple times. Sometimes I ask for help or clarification and instead of helping people just assume I know things/am capable of doing things and respond like I am stupid. I am not but I need help this is why I am asking. This is why I always state that I have level 2 autism so maybe this helps people understand that I need a lot of help but it never works really. 

One time I made a post on this subreddit that was inappropriate but I didn’t know if it was inappropriate or not so I asked people to let me know so I could delete it. Then this person was so mean to me in the comments when they could have just explained to me that it was inappropriate and I should delete. I don‘t get it. If I say I can‘t tell if it‘s ok or not to post why not just let me know? Do people think I‘m lying? 

Another time I made a post about being upset about not being able to message Katy Perry and one person was also kinda mean to me and I was very hurt. Like maybe you do not have a special interest in Katy Perry and you don‘t understand why I feel the way I do but you could just try to be nice. Unfortunately my special interest isn‘t some kind of math that will change the world. It’s just katy. 

Sometimes I tell people I have level 2 and still they still push me and try to ask me questions I cannot answer. I cannot communicate a lot of my needs I cannot express myself as well as level 1. they try to ask me about nuances on the level system or whatever and I feel so frustrated because I can‘t explain this. I ccan barely understand it myself. If you know someone is level 2 you should know their communication skills are not good so dont expect them to be able to write a full tesis on why the level system is good. Just listen to what we have to say and don’t come with „nuances“.

2263,yes,AutismInWomen,2023-05-01 00:20:42,linguisticshead,Anyone knows where can I find Katy Perry news accounts I can join and work,"Hi everyone I have been struggling a lot with my special interest (Katy Perry) because there have been some really exciting news these weeks and I have exhausted myself from talking listening and thinking about Katy Perry to the point of a shutdown. I haven’t been able to do anything else this week and have annoyed my family with Katy Perry. My aid at Uni had to take me out of class because I was bothering other students. 

My therapist told me to find Katy Perry fan accounts or news account where I can express my special interest in a healthy way with people that share my special interest. She said I should join a community to post news as well. The Katy Perry subreddit seems to be inactive. My therapist is an old lady she doesn’t know which social media I could look for. 

I know a lot of women like Katy Perry more than men I think so I thought posting here would be nice. Anyone knows how I can find this how can I get in contact to these people?

2264,yes,SpicyAutism,2023-04-29 23:11:46,linguisticshead,Addressing some concerns about this sub becoming too broad and what you should avoid posting,"Hi everyone. I see some comments around about this sub becoming too broad with lots of level 1. I would like to remember you to please contact the mods if you are having issues, if you feel like you are being left out here as a level 2 or 3, write us. We can't help or take action if we don't know what is going on. If you are concerned also about a lot of level 1s, please message us, again, we can't do anything about it if we don't know what is going on.

I know a lot of us have trouble understanding rules and abstract concepts, therefore, before posting I think you should remember a few things, I tried to give examples:

&#x200B;

1. most of us here are level 2-3. we most likely cannot help you with your friendship struggles, even if you too are level 2 or 3. according to the level classification someone who is level 2-3 has ""ability to socialize only about their special interest"" and ""severe deficits in verbal and nonverbal communication"". if you are struggling, prefer other subs like r/AutisticPeeps, r/AutismCertified or r/sourautism because there are more level 1s there who will be able to help you more than we can.
2. most of us don't have a choice about getting diagnosed or not, we don't have a clue about ""how to get accommodations"" because if we have no accommodations (that are usually provided with the help of our caregivers) we probably wouldn't be able to actively participate anywhere. there is no ""masking"" or ""telling people I am autistic"".
3. our communications deficits are more severe than other autistics. most of the time we cannot explain or communicate our needs. e.g. I know I need help socializing but I cannot clearly explain well. I know levels are different, but don't ask me about the nuance on the level system because I simply can't comprehend it. **this is often seen on other autism subreddits in which level 1s assume we will be able to explain as well as they can and this is not something we want happening here.** e.g. when talking about levels people will ask ""but how about this person that can do X and Y but can't do Z"". I don't know. most of times we don't have the ability to explain or comprehend this.
4. this is a welcoming place for parents to ask about their kids, specially those kids with high support needs. I know a lot of internet spaces are not safe for you. We will be happy to hear and try to help you. consider our difficulties when asking, try to ask direct questions because this is easier for us. also consider adding some more information, for example if your kid also has language and/or speech impairment which can provide insight about what can help them or not.

&#x200B;

I hope this provides clarity about what kind of posts should be avoided, feel free to ask me for more examples. Again, if you are having issues **contact the mods**. I don't feel it's time to have new rules or ""certified"" flairs, so let's contribute to keep this an open space respecting our experiences.

Edit: our level 1 friends are welcome here, just be mindful before posting about your struggles and experiences having in mind what we struggle with.",19,76,76,0.94,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='1339ku3')>,,/r/SpicyAutism/comments/1339ku3/addressing_some_concerns_about_this_sub_becoming/,False
2265,yes,SpicyAutism,2023-04-23 18:20:59,linguisticshead,Being a level 2 autistic lesbian in a homophobic household,"I am frustrated with somethings my dad said yesterday and decided to make this post. I have moderate autism and I have been diagnosed since I was very little. My parents are extremely loving and caring, they have provided me with everything they can. They are very understanding when it comes to my autism and they help me a lot. 


But my family is very religious. I am not required to go to the synagogue but they are all very very religious and follow the rules very strictly. When I was a teen I used to be very upset by this but now I also found a way to connect with my religion and I also accept that this is how they are and it‘s ok. The only issue is that they are also extremely LGBTQ+phobic. My parents are both right wing and though I don’t care much about politics I Connect better with the left. I have to hear comments saying I have no sense of style because I dress like a boy (things I like as well as sensorily more comfortable). My dad doesn’t think I am even capable of dressing myself properly and this is why I look like a boy. I hear homophobic statements all the time and when I was 13 my dad found out I had a crush on a girl and he said the internet was influencing me and that there’s no way I could know that I am a lesbian because I am autistic. I have heard a lot of similar things throughout my adolescence until my therapist told me I should stop trying to argue with him because it was just causing me meltdowns and he wasn’t changing his opinion any time soon so it was better to avoid arguments. 


The other problem is, I will probably never be able to get a job. I will probably never be able to live by myself. I am 20 years old and am fully dependent on my parents. I need them to feed me, shower, take me places, help me study for University, pay for therapies… sometimes I wish I could move out and be openly a lesbian and dress the way I want without being judged but I can’t do that. It‘s not like other people that live in homophobic environments but they can try to get a job and leave. I will never be able to do that. Though I am level 2 I still wish to get into dating eventually and have a family and this would be a way to get out of my house but my parents wouldn’t allow me to live with a woman and because I am autistic I usually can’t tell if people have good or bad intentions which means I also cannot ask for mom and dad to help me find someone and I am afraid I get myself into an abusive relationship (which has happened before).

2266,yes,SpicyAutism,2023-04-16 02:39:44,linguisticshead,I am so done with the autistic community,"I am so tired guys. I recently got in an argument with my autism student group at Uni because they were claiming they were level 2 but classified as level 1 just because they can speak (better explained on my tumblr will leave the link in comments). 

I am so done people saying that autism is not a disability. I am so done people saying that autism shouldn’t be treated. 

I am so tired of people saying levels are ableist, that everyone is equally autistic. I am so done people romantizing autism online and ignoring  all the harmful traits. 

We literally just had a post on the sub about a case worker (I think) whose client was exhausting herself from talking about her special interest. All the people that claim that special interests are amazing I wish they could read this post. I have gone through similar stuff. Special interest can make us fully exhausted. 

I am so tired of ABA hate from people who have not gone through ABA neither would have needed it (have talked about why before maybe should find a comment ) neither know anyone in real life that has been in ABA.

I am tired of the neurodiversity movement promoting all of this stuff. I am tired of the social model of disability. I am tired of people hating on the parents of autistic people. 

I am tired of hearing „go nonverbal“ even when people know its not a good word. I am tired of fighting for people to acknowledge we exist (level 2 and 3). I am tired of people mocking me for things my autism causes me (link for tumblr post in comments)

Guys I am so tired and I am so sad. I just overheard my mom crying while talking to my dad on the other room because sje said she thought when I went to Uni I would make friends and people would be nicer to me.

I don’t get it. It seems like people want to be the victim and want to suffer like we do. If you are level 2 or 3 (truly diagnosed) you should know levels are important so why are you arguing with me about the validity of levels ?

2269,yes,autism,2023-03-28 16:02:01,linguisticshead,"What is nonverbal and why you can't ""go nonverbal""","Hi everyone, my goal on this website is to bring awareness of level 2 and 3 autism which are often left out in our community. I made a post yesterday about changing the word ""go nonverbal"" to mutism and I see that some people don't understand what is being nonverbal so I will explain.

People who are nonverbal cannot **physically** produce speech. It's either an issue on your **motor skills** that keep you from producing sounds and therefore speech or a language impairment in which your brain **doesn't understand language** overall. I have an example from when I was a kid, if you asked me what my name was, I would point (I used PECS) to my age. I would do that because I didn't understand language, my brain just didn't hear words. 

When you are **able to physically produce language with no phonological/grammar mistakes**, you can't be nonverbal. There is no discussion. What happens to most of level 1 and 2 autistics is that you can **perfectly produce speech but there are situations that affect you psychologically and you are unable to speak for a certain period of time**. This is what I like to call autistic mutism. 

My choice to name it that way is:

1. It's psychological, not physical (meaning your brain and phonological organs are perfect), so it can't be nonverbal/nonspeaking.
2. ""Autistic"" because it differs from mutism in an anxiety disorder, since when it occurs with anxiety disorder, it has a few reasons/triggers, but in autism, the triggers and the reasons are different. For example one autistic person might have difficulty speaking if they are sensorily overwhelmed. 

It's important that we use the right words to talk about our experiences because that way we can respect our nonverbal friends. Nonverbal used to be a word to describe a very unique experience of being physically unable to produce speech and we are using it to describe a completely different experiences. That causes our nonverbal friends to be even more left out than they already are, because you will see autistics who have no issues with speech claim that they understand/can speak about the experience of those who actually are nonspeaking. 

I will not elaborate on why it's wrong from us to use this word to talk about mutism. I can recommend a few nonverbal friends who have written about why tell feel offended by this use. 

""But I have **constant** issues with speech, what about me?"" That's where the ICD-11 and a speech therapist come in. The ICD-11 will classify autistics in categories: 

\- Presence or not of Intellectual Disability and is it mild, moderate or severe.

\- Presence or not of functional language impairment and is it mild, moderate or severe.

My case is classified as mild functional language impairment as I am capable of producing *most* (not all) sounds perfectly but have quite severe issues with breathing, tone, speed and some more things. Reminder that just ""speaking like a robot"" which is usually used to describe how autistic people speak is **not enough** to classify language impairment. People who are nonspeaking fit the severe category and people who are semi-speaking (which means you can produce up to 30 words, if I'm not mistaken by the number) fit the moderate and probably severe category. 

These speech issues are caught on very easily, it's very hard to go undiagnosed, even if you are not diagnosed with ASD, you might be diagnosed with global language impairment in the ICD-10 or ICD-11 (but in ICD-11 you can't be diagnosed with language impairment at the same time as ASD since the ASD category already classifies us with/without language impairment).

But, still, if you have a lot of trouble with speech, your case might be similar to mine. But **only a speech therapist** can make a full evaluation of your speech and tell you if you classify as language impairment or not. 

If that's not your case, what you experience is mutism. It's not ""going nonverbal"", it's not being ""semi-verbal"". These mean things completely different. Let's listen to our nonverbal friends, let's give them space to talk about their own experiences without having perfectly speaking autistics come and say that they ""go nonverbal too"". Let's respect the experience of those of us with higher support needs. 

We listen to you, we listen to you all the time. I learned what is masking, I learned that some people are late-diagnosed, I learned that for some people autism is an invisible disability. I had no clue these things existed. So, please, do the same to us and listen to our experiences. Listen to what we have to say, give us space and don't speak over us.

EDIT: To those of you saying that nonverbal doesn’t mean what I tried to explain here in the dictionary let‘s imagine I am NT and I say that I mask in Social situations, wouldn‘t it be offensive for autistics who are burnt out from masking their whole lives to hear that from an NT? It‘s the same thing with „nonverbal“. Mask has the same meaning in the dictionary but you will agree with me that nothing compares to the experience of autistic masking.",416,1513,1513,0.94,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='124tkis')>,,/r/autism/comments/124tkis/what_is_nonverbal_and_why_you_cant_go_nonverbal/,False
2270,yes,autism,2023-03-27 17:41:40,linguisticshead,An alternative to saying „go nonverbal“,"Hello everyone. As an autistic girl with speech impairments and used AAC, I know well how it feels to not be able to speak sometimes. But, our nonverbal/nonspeaking friends have been talking about how they don‘t like it when speaking autistics say that they go nonverbal. If anyone is interested on why I could send you some links and texts from nonverbal colleagues, but I don‘t want to share their posts publically.

I always say it‘s better to say you have mutism sometimes and some people tell me it can‘t be mutism because mutism is an anxiety disorder. Which I think it‘s hypocritical because there are so many things that people argue to change when it comes to autism (theory of mind for example because some people say autistics don‘t have issues with it), that I think it‘s time for us to start talking about mutism in autism. No, it‘s not the same as in an anxiety disorder, it‘s different, we can have mutism if we are overwhelmed not exactly anxious. 

It‘s time we start to make changes that better describe our experiences while respecting our nonspeaking friends and not talking over them. We, as speaking autistics, will never understand the experience of being nonverbal. 

I suggest we all start thinking about a definition of mutism in speaking autistics instead of taking up space from our friends.",67,69,69,0.89,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='123uduo')>,,/r/autism/comments/123uduo/an_alternative_to_saying_go_nonverbal/,False

(Explained),"This woman is a tiktoker I don’t know what kind of video she makes as I don‘t follow her but I came across this recent issue she had. Her 10 year old autistic son spent 800$ on Roblox after finding out that if he clicked „forgot password“ he could purchase money without the actual Apple ID password. 

He made multiple 100$ purchases on his phone and on his sister‘s tablet. His mom is blaming Apple for allowing this „trick“ that doesn’t require you to put your Apple ID password (which the boy didn’t have). 

When I saw this I thought this was totally the boys fault. Then the mom said he is very very smart but autistic. In my opinion sometimes we as autistic people might no have a sense of danger/money etc but if the boy found a way to purchase without needing the mom‘s password he knew exactly what he was doing and this is the boy‘s fault. 

Mom says everytime he wants Roblox money he asks her and she would buy 10$ or 15$ so this shows the boy knew that he should ask his mom to buy this but he found a way to buy as much as he wanted without having to ask his mom so I honestly don‘t see how it‘s Apple‘s fault? 

Maybe if he had never bought Roblox money before and tried to do it for the first time that might have been reasonable but the boy already knew he had to ask his mom.

Hi guys I am 20 years old soon to be 21. i have level 2 autism and I started University last year. It has been a really hard journey as someone with autism but I am slowly feeling better. I have an aid that helps me during classes and through her I met one girl who invited me to join her „group“ of friends. 

I hung out with them for most of the year. Which is really not a lot as I don‘t go out much. One girl (let’s call her A) in the group thought I was pretty and she wanted to kiss me in September. She has a level 1 autistic brother and I thought she understood me. We had a few issues because she told me three times I was a „cold“ person because I didn’t show love. I explained that I was different but after three times she still wasn’t convinced. That was one thing that had bothered me about her but I tried to let it go. 

In February I visited my family in Germany and even though we spoke very little when I was there (when I change my routine I completely forget to answer texts, eat, take my meds, shower etc and she only texted twice) when I came home two weeks ago I texted her on WhatsApp and everything was fine . I asked her if she wanted to go out with me and we did. She asked me how my trip was and I told her somethings about it and specially about my friend, let’s call her B. I met B in Germany about 5 years ago. She is my best friend in the whole world. I never thought I could actually connect to someone or have a true friendship before I met her. B and I have never had anything else more than friendship and I love her so much. She was the first person outside of my family to try and understand me and have the patience to communicate with me. She understands me 100% and she means a lot to me. And of course everytime when I go to Germany I like to spend a lot of time with B.  

Our day is normal, we eat and go for a walk together and everything seems to be fine. I get home, I text A saying that it was a very nice day and she says she thinks so too. We talk normally. Three days later she says she wants to speak with me in person and we meet at Uni this Monday. She then tells me for like 20 minutes straight how I am in love with B (even if I don‘t know it) and how she cried for two hours after our day together because of the way I spoke about my friend B . She says I am using her as a temporary fix because My friend B is in Germany and we are in Brazil but I tell her that’s not it at all because I made it clear to her (even before this conversation) that B was only my friend. I also told her I didn’t text her a lot because it‘s hard for me to remember things if I am in following my routine . 

A is really pissed and I tell her I had no idea she didn’t like that I told her about B because she was asking questions about B and what we did and we were having a normal conversation. She says she needs to back away because she is in love with me and she can’t see me if I am in love with someone else. I say it’s ok and I understand and I think everything is really ok. I go on with my day. 

Then later on someone from the friend group tells me I fucked up and I ask why. They say it’s because I was talking about my friend B with A. Then I explain that I didn’t know K wasn’t supposed to do it and then this person tells me that she heard from A something that I did not say and I had to explain everything that happened because on that day I was just hanging out with A and talking about my time in Germany. 

After this I had a meltdown because I realize everyone in the group now thinks I am a really bad person and she is telling lies about things I didn’t say. I also noticed that the people in the friend group are staying far away from me  and this is really sad because I have no other friends. I also use AAC to communicate and I am very stereotypically autistic which makes it very hard to make friends.

2280,yes,autism,2023-02-24 09:43:21,linguisticshead,"A post from ""theautismcafe"" that I think everyone should read.","You might have seen me around already and if you haven't I have moderate autism and I try to advocate for those of us who have high Support needs. I really like this Page on instagram and when I read this I thought everyone should too. My mom says she also relates a lot to this post because when I was a kid I had no sense of danger at all.


*Today, I’m angry. I usually do my best to be soft with my wording, even when writing about things that make my blood boil. But today, I won’t.

Today, I‘m writing to you about the constant fears I live with about preventing the accidental death of my severely autistic child.

A few months ago, I posted a reel with tips on how to “autism-proof” a house. Tips included things like getting a plexiglass half-wall and extra locks on doors/cabinets. I‘ve since gotten dozens of comments on why I’m a horrible person because my terminology is “disgusting” and “ableist”.

I’m angry because:

1. It’s trivial. Those comments come from autistic people who have the privilege of getting offended by my choice of words and voicing their concerns on social media. They’re once again focused on a trivial “issue” rather than the fact that autistic children are dying.
2. There’s no winning. Charlie is almost 10. If I had used the term “baby-proofing”, I would have been accused of infantilizing him. It’s not child-proofing either because most neurotypical 10-year-old children understand basic danger like the fact that jumping off a 12 feet balcony is dangerous.
3. They’re generalizing. If you read the comments, you’ll see “I’m autistic and we’re not stupid, we understand danger.” It angers me because it is self-centered and shows that those autistic people who scream the loudest on social media don’t understand autistic people on the severe side of the spectrum. They will tell you severe autism isn’t real anyway.
4. It’s a dangerous narrative. The leading cause of death for autistic people are accidental deaths by injury and drowning. Autism-proofing can save lives.

If self-diagnosed autistics and autistic adults with low support-needs spent less time attacking people for their use of “wrong” terminology and more time trying to understand that autism is a spectrum, maybe we’d save lives.

Now, excuse me, I’m gonna go back to autism-proofing my house so my child doesn’t accidentally suffocate on the cotton rounds I didn’t think I needed to lock away.*

2283,yes,SpicyAutism,2023-02-10 21:58:52,linguisticshead,About my special interest and how I connect with the world,"Hi guys this is a text I wrote about my special interest. If you have questions please ask me or if you want to say something I will be happy to answer. 


I like to describe my autism as living on another planet by myself. I have my own home, my own rules and I am happy there. Whenever I have to interact with someone it is like a go on a space ship heading to planet earth and when I get there the space ship helps me communicate with a different language. 


My special interest in languages started when I was very little, I was always very interested in languages, I learned multiple alphabets when I was 6 years old, but because of my speech difficulties, it was always very hard to speak. I was also very withdrawn as a kid, I didn't acknowledge other people so I was just learning by myself, because it was fun.


I was about 10 years old when I found out who Katy Perry was and that completely changed my life, not only because I am a huge „katycat“ to this day but also because through her I could find a way to connect with the world. 


My parents, therapists, doctors, always tried to motivate me to speak but even though I could understand everything I never was interested enough in people to actually speak. That changed when I met Katy Perry. For the first time ever, I was talking with my mom to practice English because I really wanted to understand everything Katy was saying and I wanted to talk to her if I ever met her.


I was so amazed by how I could put new words together and how I could use the words in her songs to describe things I didn‘t understand. I was finally understanding these things that she was saying and I wanted to learn how to do it as well. By the time I was 12 I was already learning German. 


That was when my parents put me in English class. They didn’t want me to do it first because they thought people were going to be mean to me. And they were. A few months later they were told I couldn‘t come to the classes anymore because I was too quiet. I was very sad and it was a difficult time for me. I didn’t speak for some time in this period because I was very upset. 


After some time, my parents decided to hire a private German teacher as a way to motivate me to continue speaking and when I was 13 at my school we had an exchange student from Germany and she was the first friend I ever had. Through language I could communicate, but not my own language because I didn’t think it was worth the effort (to go on a space ship to earth). But I am just so amazed by them that by speaking other languages that I finally found a motivation to go on my space ship and talk to people. After I was able to help this German teenager at my school to get around my school made me „official guide“ for exchange students. I was asked to translate some things and to help them with my language. 


I am not active in Portuguese communities even online because it‘s just too much effort to talk and I am not even practicing a language I am not native of. Through language, I, someone with speech impairments, was able to find a way to connect with the world. 


I am now 20 years old, I can speak good English and German, some Finnish and Hebrew too which I am working on. I just started my major in Linguistics last year and I love every second of it, even when it‘s so difficult for me as someone with autism. I don‘t know if I can truly explain how much my special interest means to me but it‘s the only way I found to connect with people. It‘s like me and the aliens from planet earth have something in common that we like and that we can talk about: language. And the cool thing is that I don‘t always need to speak to practice my skills, I can write, read and listen. I can use my AAC in different languages. And the most important of all, I want to do it. I want to interact because I want to learn more.",19,45,45,0.98,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='10z49jp')>,,/r/SpicyAutism/comments/10z49jp/about_my_special_interest_and_how_i_connect_with/,False

I have a high IQ but still all of my disabilities caused by my autism seem to get the best of me. I see other people doing so well, getting good grades, doing things by themselves and I can't even properly communicate verbally.

I was given a lot of accommodations in Uni and I did good at best. I just can't keep up. I can't keep up with people my age, I can't make friends with people my age and I can't kiss or similar stuff. 

I just feel so out of touch with reality. My special interest is languages and I am most active on the English speaking autistic community because I feel that is the only way I can somewhat connect with people. The effort that I make by thinking in English is fun because languages are the only thing in the world that make me connect to people. My best friend is from another country too because we started chatting because I wanted to practice German. 

I feel like being me is being out of touch with the world and whatever is going on. Maybe this has to do with my lack of empathy as well but i just feel like an astronaut flying above earth with no communications. I am just there. That's me.

2287,yes,AutisticPeeps,2023-01-22 21:17:42,linguisticshead,I am glad I found you and my thoughts on self-diagnosis,"Hi everyone, I wanted to make this post because I don't think I could post my thoughts anywhere else on Reddit. I have been keeping this on me for some time now and I like to share things online to get them off my mind. I am glad I found this community because since 2020 I see self-diagnosis growing and I see a lot of autism content creators supporting self-diagnosis. Every time I tried to say I was against self-diagnosis I was attacked.

I was never particularly against it, I just didn't support it, and I didn't think it was a big deal, until faced with two situations: in 2021 I had an evaluation so my doctor could write a report for my Uni application so I could be accommodated. I am usually evaluated often, I have speech and cognitive impairments that we usually check every once in a while. But this time, I actually read my report and I was shocked to be honest, I never knew how many small traits of autism they could gather from a few tests. It's literally crazy how neuropsychologists can access every part of your brain and give you a full report without even knowing you. I always have these evaluations with different professionals who I haven't met before, so they're not biased. From that moment on, I realized no amount of self research could bring as much information as an evaluation. Adding to that all the other symptons that are autistic symptons but could be caused by something else like trauma.

Secondly, when I started University in 2022 I realized how much harm self-diagnosis actually do. I am visibly disabled and I had a lot of difficulty at Uni this first year. I had people discussing in group chats that they got a bad grade on the test because they were ""probably"" autistic and the Professor wasn't accepting. Then, I joined an autism student group and found out most of them were self-diagnosed and I felt so left out because of my speech impairments I just couldn't keep up with them. I am the only level 2 autistic on that group and they do nothing to accommodate me which is very sad. 

I live in one of the biggest cities in the world and I know that probably in real life a lot of people are against self-diagnosis as well but I see that a lot of people in real life are starting to join these trends of self-diagnosing with autism, specially in big and developed cities like mine. Still, no one that claimed to be neurodivergent in that group with that Professor came to talk to me after I said I was autistic on the group chat and that the Professor was actually very accommodating. 

Maybe this also has to do with the fact that a lot of self-diagnosed people aren't autistic and make friends really easily and I feel bad because until now at Uni the only friends I made were my two female Professors who helped me. While I really like them, I would enjoy being friends with 20 year olds instead of my only friends being 60 and 67. This is maybe just a vent.

Anyways, I am glad I found you. We have to stand up because I feel like autism is becoming a meaningless term to describe a personality trait. Is there any discord server I can join?

I met this girl in one of my classes and she came to talk to me because her brother is autistic. We start to hang out during break and she helps me studying. She tells me she thinks I look nice and that she would like to kiss me. I said I think she looks nice too and that I would like to try. We kiss one time. It’s not so bad. I think I am doing great with talking and physical contact. She asks if I like her and I say yes. Then she says I don’t look interested because I don’t show emotions. She tells me she has been crying a lot because of me. She says I am really confusing and she doesn’t understand me and she is in love. I say that this is how I am and that I like her. We agree to keep talking. 

 Some time later She sends me a message saying she doesn’t wanna talk to me anymore because I don’t have emotions and I don’t show that I like her too. I tell her I like her but it’s really hard for me to talk and to keep in touch. I also say I was giving my best with physical touch and I even told my therapist that I thought I was doing a lot of physical contact. She says sorry beacause she didn’t think that it was that hard for me because her brother is very talkative and loves physical contact (he‘s level 1). 


We keep talking. We kiss one more time. On new years she asks me again if I really like her. I ask why she is asking this again. She gets angry. I say I already responded that I like her. She says she is sorry because she is really insecure and because I don’t show emotions and affection she thinks I am faking it. I say I am not. Conversation ends. Everything ok. We talk a little after new years but not much. 


Today I texted her because I saw a sculpture of a dinossaur and I know her brothers likes them so I sent a picture and tell her that I remembered her brotjer. She answers normally. Later on I went to send her on Instsgram the page of the place I visited with dinousssurs and I notice she blocked me on instagram. So I sent her a message again asking if she is mad at me because I noticed she blocked me. 


I feel bad about making other people feel bad and I am really worried.

This is something I have been wondering for awhile and I will try not to make this sound silly but it‘s genuinly a curiosity I have. I like playing games a lot since I was a kid but I feel like I am so bad a fighting. Like worse than I should be. I have been playing Minecraft for 9 years and even on easy mode I die frequently at caves attacked by zombies. I only killed the dragon once and I died multiple times. I never get better. 

I have recently started playing Moonlighter and I have the easiest mode on and I still am so bad. I am good at Stardew Valley expect for the mining. I really suck at fighting monsters. 

I was wondering if this had to do with sensory processing? I am easily overwhelmed by lights and visual stuff overall so maybe it‘s the reason why my brain can‘t react so fast in games and I die quickly?

I have flown a lot of times with my parents and overall I really enjoy flying, I love airplanes. In January I will be travelling to Germany by myself (GRU-BER) and I was wondering if I could apply for disability services? Lufthansa's website only states behavioral or mental disorders, which doesn't really fit autism (developmental disorder) so I am not sure if I can apply for that. I am worried as well that they might say I can't travel alone if I state that I have a mental disorder. But I would be looking for a few things only: I would like to board the plane earlier and leave later so I don't get overwhelmed with everyone walking around. It would be nice to have someone guide me to my connection flight in Frankfurt but I can also do it by myself - it isn't so necessary.

2297,yes,SpicyAutism,2022-12-04 16:27:58,linguisticshead,Feeling sad and overwhelmed with change and end of year holidays,"Hi guys, some of you might have seen me in the comments already, I am a level 2, 20yogirl and I just want to vent. I hate holidays, I hate New Years, I hate the break in my routine. Every year during this time when things start changing I get so incredibly upset and overwhelmed. This year things are even harder: it was my first year in my Linguistics and Literature degree. In my country right now it's summer vacation (starts next week and we come back in March only) and that means everything is changing, not only because it's a new year (not a new semester) but because in the first year of my degree everyone takes the same introduction subjects and next year we choose the subjects in the languages we want to focus on so I will be alone again.

One of the languages I'm taking (Hebrew) is only at night, so that means I am not going to see anyone with whom I had classes with this year and I will only know my schedule in January, so until then I don't know exactly how things will be, I can't plan. I have moderate communication and speech issues that made it even harder for me to make friends and get around alone, I am also visibly autistic and people tend to notice so it's not so easy to get to know people. In school I used to have a therapeutic accompanier but my parents still couldn't get the government to pay for one in Uni. 

I have two professors who have been extremely helpful to me this year. Last month I was at Uni when I found out my grandpa died and I had a meltdown, one of these Professors helped me, took me to her office and called my parents. She was so nice. I meet this Professor every Thursday because even though I don't have classes with her in the second semester, she was teaching the class next to me so I always stop to say hi and chat a little to know how she is doing. I just found out that she is not teaching anything next semester, so I will not see her likely until the second semester of 2023. I am so upset. I will not have any classes with the other Professor who has also been very good to me but I will probably stop by at her office to say hi once a month or so because she teaches in the morning and according to my plan (which is not 100% yet as I don't have my schedule, I am comparing the offering of subjects to other years and using this to plan) I will have one day in which I will go to Uni in the morning. 

I know I can still email her and keep in touch (I plan to ask if I can join her study group in Gerative Linguistics next year - it's online) but still this doesn't make it any easier to deal with the change. Adding to that there is Christmas coming up, New Years, Hanukkah because my family is inter-religious... I am so upset I just want to vent. I know some people like vacation because it's a break from social interaction but I hate it because it completely ruins my schedule. I also don't know any of the Professors I will have next year, all of them will be new.",8,21,21,0.97,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='zce3k2')>,,/r/SpicyAutism/comments/zce3k2/feeling_sad_and_overwhelmed_with_change_and_end/,False

Like if I hear something bad about me I feel so awful, I can't even describe the feeling, it's so bad. I am struggling with this today, I am feeling so bad I want to cry. I had a presentation in the University and I am level 2 and minimally verbal. I really wanted to do it so I challenged myself to it. I spoke to the Professor before and explained my situation. She wasn't very nice about it but that would make a whole other post. 

So today before the presentation began I went to the toilet and tried some breathing exercises. I did my part, I spoke great. My colleagues told me later that while I was out, the Prof. asked for us to start and they said I was just getting ready at the toilet to which she responded ""oh, she's **THAT** nervous? it's just a presentation!"". 

When I came back she said ""hi, all good?"" and then I said ""yeah I just needed to use the toilet"". I thought she was being nice but now I don't think she took me serious (also when I explained the situation before I don't think she took me serious too). 

This happens quite often that I feel like such comments make me feel so bad. Like I take these things so personally and it hurts me a lot.

I was diagnosed with moderate autism at the age of 6. Currently my diagnosis is based on the ICD-11, ASD with mild-moderate speech impairment and no intellectual disability. Recently on this sub, there was a controversial post about taking back the puzzle piece symbol from autism moms/ASpeaks etc. I personally believe this can't be discussed easily. But, I really wish that some of you understood I can't leave my house without wearing my puzzle piece lanyard. No, the infinity symbol or the sunflower aren't well-known in my non-European/North American country. I have a very hard time speaking, I get overwhelmed very easily and the puzzle piece helps me navigate daily quite independently. It allows me to get special attendance on the subway, stores and basically anywhere with lines. My autism lanyard helps people be more patient with me when I have a hard time speaking. Taking that symbol back would be so helpful to me because sometimes I get left out in autism groups by saying I use it daily and people get angry saying I support AS etc which is definitely not the case.

This is just an example of things that usually level 1 autistics don't think about. Level 2 and 3 autistics are most of the time either infantilized by our families or left out in autism groups and discussions about neurodiversity. You all might have noticed that most autistic popular creators inside and outside our community are level 1 and yeah, I get it, NTs prefer listening to autistics who speak well etc, but I really wish our community made an effort to listen to us. 

Also when recently talking about levels/support needs/whatever other classification of autism and I hear a lot of people saying it doesn't make sense to classify us. I do agree that this isn't perfect but it is important to have it. When I email a teacher of mine saying I am autistic it is important they know I cannot control my stimming, I cannot 'properly' speak and sometimes I won't answer when they talk to me. That is why I like labels. Also, I know it's all about inclusivity but I have been told to be ""moderate autistic"" since I was 6 years old, I can't even change my seat in class without having a meltdown, can you imagine how hard it is to change the way I have been called my whole life? I am working on it but you all know autistics have a hard time with change. 

This isn't an attack as I said. I just get sad sometimes and really wish other autistics thought about us too and didn't get angry when I say I wear the puzzle piece or stuff like this. I know it's also something that there are more level 1 autistics than level 2 and 3 so that might also be the reason why we don't get much attention but yeah that is it guys... thanks for reading.",338,1932,1932,0.97,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='x8jfhl')>,,/r/autism/comments/x8jfhl/please_listen_to_level_2_and_3_autistics/,False

2307,yes,autism,2022-03-08 23:49:09,linguisticshead,Is Autism being overdiagnosed? Is the definition of Autism too broad? I want to hear from autistic folks.,"Hello everyone, I am a 19 year-old autistic woman who is considered ""level 2"" or ""higher support needs"". I was diagnosed as a kid and personally I have seem the amount of autism diagnosis increasingly grow since I was a teen and began to actually participate in the community. I do think that people with higher support needs are not so well represented in the community that is full with people with less support needs and with the whole discussion about editing the DSM-V, I have been more interested to know what autistic people think. 

I know a lot more people have been diagnosed because we have a better understanding of what autism is, including in girls. But, what I am looking for is: do you think more people are being diagnosed than they should? 

*""A study carried out by researchers at the University of Montreal found evidence that suggests that more people with milder autism symptoms are being diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. The differences between people diagnosed with autism and those who don’t have autism have decreased.""* 

What do you guys think about this? Here is the [link](https://www.elemy.com/studio/autism-diagnosis/is-it-overdiagnosed/). Do you think an autism diagnosis is just becoming a way of saying someone is ""shy"" or ""introvert""? (Yes, I know being autistic is not the same of being shy/introvert etc).  They say ""*the autism category has considerably overextended"",* so what does it really mean to be autistic? 

Personally, I am not really sure what to think about this. I worry that in the future people might not take my issues seriously because of so many people who are considered ""lower support needs"". I think that those of us who have a harder time in life and want to talk about how autism can be really shitty are being shadowed by people who want to be positive and people who can in fact live independently. 

*In his opinion, autism studies include too many participants who aren’t different enough from people without autism. In contrast to the generally prevailing scientific belief, Dr. Mottron thinks that including more participants in studies on autism, as it is currently defined, reduces the likelihood of discovering new things about the cognitive, brain and genetic mechanisms underlying the condition. Indeed  no major discoveries have been made in this field in the last 10 years.* 

This is an [interesting article](https://nouvelles.umontreal.ca/en/article/2019/08/21/is-it-autism-the-line-is-being-increasingly-blurred/). 

*In almost every trait assessed, including “emotion recognition” the measurable differences shrank by 45 to 80 per cent.* 

So, I can assume (correct me if I am wrong) that my difficulties are a lot more nuanced than the difficulties from kids being diagnosed nowadays because of the difference between autistics and allistics shrinking over the years. How should I feel about this? I don't know, that is why I want to hear from you. I worry that saying ""I am autistic"" in the future will mean absolutely nothing, when in fact, I have overall a really hard time.",40,42,42,0.88,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='t9ucbp')>,,/r/autism/comments/t9ucbp/is_autism_being_overdiagnosed_is_the_definition/,False

I had a Lhasa Apso of 13 years old, I am autistic and I got her when I was 6, because my therapist said it was a great way for me to learn how to socialize better, it indeed was. She meant everything to me. A year ago we found out she had cardiac disease, very common in small dogs like her, since day one, we did everything possible to keep her comfortable and healthy. We gave her her medication, regular visits to her cardiologist and so on. Unfortunately, the disease progressed extremely quickly in her. 

On the week before she passed, she was admitted to the hospital because she had fluid in her lungs (the heart disease causes it) but fortunately she was able to come back home after 3 days. They said she had minor change on her kidney function (max 1.4, was at 1.9) but we would keep an eye on it. On Wednesday and Friday that week, we took her to the Vet to make sure she was okay, she wasn’t eating but she has always been a picky eater and the doctor said it was also side effects from the heart medication. 

Over the weekend we took her to the beach (her favorite place), but noticing that she wasn‘t getting any better, we drove back home. Blood test done 5 days later to the prior one detected kidney failure with no chance of change, from 1.9, it went to 8.7. Doctor said she had 3 days max. 

On Wednesday, I had a really important job interview far away. Dad took me, we both agreed that staying at home wouldn‘t make me feel good. She died at home with my mom and my grandma, at around 13h30m. I knew she was going to die, I said goodbye before I left. But I can‘t stop thinking about the Vet who took her away. I can’t stop thinking about the person who carried her away, the person who was with her when they cremated her. I can‘t deal with the thought that none of this people knew who she was and what she meant. Who held her at last? Who took her away not knowing that this dog meant everything for me? Who held her? I don’t know how to deal with this. I just need to tell someone. Who held my baby for the last time?

2315,yes,AutismInWomen,2021-09-19 15:28:44,linguisticshead,I feel like my best friend acts like I'm overreacting about my autism,"Hey everyone, I have a friend who has been very close to me since before my diagnosis. When I told her I had been sent to a full autism evaluation, she didn’t take me very seriously and thought my therapist was just overreacting. We didn't really have a conversation about my diagnosis, I just told her they confirmed that I was autistic. 

Recently I had a job interview to be a camp‘s monitor (being around the teens, taking care of them). This is a job I‘ve wanted for a very long time. My friend went with me to the interview and when I finished I told her I had told the interviewers I am autistic and that one of the reasons why I wanted to work there is because I also want autistic teens to have fun at these camps because usually we might not have so much fun the „usual way“. We also had to write an essay and I wrote mine about inclusion of autistic teens or teens with other disabilities in these trips.

She responded like „I can‘t believe you told them about your stuff*“ (your stuff being my autism). Then we made our way home and where I live autistic people have a few benefits while riding the train like priority sitting spots, so I said to her jokingly that my ""special needs"" for the day was to sit down and she answered ""You've already talked about this stuff* today, you want to do it again?"" *being my autism. 

I went home and didn't say anything else but the things she said made me feel very bad. Like, what is the problem if I want to advocate for autistic teens? What if I do want to say during a job interview that I am autistic and that they will have to understand that I might be a bit different from the other employees? What is the matter if I do like to talk about autism and share all the knowledge I have with people that don't know about it? 

I feel like she is tired of my autism, but we barely speak about it. She refuses even to say the word autism, she usually says ""your thing, your stuff"". She made me feel bad for sharing my autism during the interview and just bad overall for talking about it with her and other people. I guess I just need some reassurance that it is okay to talk about autism with others, that it is okay to be openly autistic and not want/need to mask the whole time. It is okay to try to get a job advocating for autistic teens, even if that means that I won't get hired because people are so ableist. I will keep trying until I get a job that understand me and understands/wants to understand autism. 

I feel like I need some reassurance that it is okay to be openly autistic. That I shouldn't feel bad for not hiding it. Any of you can help me with this? I am feeling pretty bad. Feeling like I should have hidden my autism.

EDIT: Guys I forgot to mention that she and her whole family as well have ADHD. She has moderate learning disabilities though I don‘t think she has commorbid autism, she has also been evaluated since she was a child. We went to school together so we often talked about her ADHD because I‘d help her learn and study so it‘s not like the Neurodiversity topic is new to her because we have always had very open conversations about her ADHD and also her little sister‘s who also has dyslexia.",40,107,107,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='pra1zu')>,,/r/AutismInWomen/comments/pra1zu/i_feel_like_my_best_friend_acts_like_im/,False
2316,yes,PVCs,2021-09-16 17:20:27,linguisticshead,To those who have been cleared by doctors,"Hey everyone, I want to share this story because it might help you who have been cleared by doctors but at still scared/unsure. I‘m 19F, been having PVCs since 17 and even though I have had all tests clear, I had a really hard time accepting that I am fine and there is nothing wrong with my heart. 

I have a friend, same age as me, also F. Recently she was feeling tired and that her heart was racing, so she went to the ER. She had the same standart tests we‘ve all had, EKG, Echo, Blood and X-Ray. The cardiologist at the ER knew that there was something off. 

She then went to a cardiologist who just by looking at these few labs noticed that somethings are indeed off, but nothing too concerning. She will have more tests these next few weeks and she probably has an arrythmia. The thing is; when there‘s something wrong with the heart, doctors can tell. So many of us have been cleared by doctors yet we are still scared that they missed something. 

When my friend first told me this, I was really triggered, but during my therapy appointment my psyc told me exactly what I‘m telling you now, how many tests have you had? How many clear EKGs have you had? Heart issues show. They show in labs.

2318,yes,selfharm,2021-08-22 15:38:44,linguisticshead,I am so ashamed of my scars that it’s come to a point where it‘s effectively keeping me from doing things and living life.,"Hey everyone, I really need some help. Long story short, I started cutting in my early teens, eventually got better – currently 19 and still do it eventually. I have some scars on my wirst. They‘re not bad at all, like you can see them but they‘re not that big (there‘s a picture in my profile you guys can check). I have been wearing wristbands nonstop since I was 12 to hide them. 

My parents already know, though no one else in my family does. A few close friends have seen them, though I never talked about it with anyone. Summer is coming for us in the South Hemisphere and I feel like shit already. It‘s getting to hot to wear jackets and I‘m so tired of wearing wristbands. The ones I have on at the moment barely cover my scars and I feel totally naked. 

I‘ve come to a point where I don‘t mind if random people see them but I can‘t possibly stand the thought of my parents or anyone close to me seeing them. It makes me feel so ashamed, so vulnerable. I can’t even describe. 

I‘m saving for a tattoo, but I still don‘t have enough and my dad specially is veryyyy conservative and against it; so I‘m not really sure how I‘m gonna deal with that since I can’t barely be near him without a hoodie, how the hell am I gonna tell him I want to get a tattoo to cover my scars? 

I‘m really depressed at this point. I‘m supposed to visit my grandma today but it’s too hot to wear a hoodie and I don’t wanna have to be so concerned about my scars so I‘m just staying home. 

I‘m just looking for any kind of advice guys. Is there any kind of therapy I can try? Anything at all, I‘m so done but I can‘t get myself to show my scars. I haven‘t done so many things because I knew I‘d have to take off my bracelets.

2320,yes,TrueOffMyChest,2021-07-22 18:26:10,linguisticshead,The Autism Community is not inclusive and it is not a community.,"For a bit of context – I am clinically diagnosed with autism and recently I received a ton of hate on social media for sharing some views on the autism diagnosis criteria. It seems as if people forget that having difficulties communicating is a part of being on the spectrum and you are not allowed to complain how fucking hard this is sometimes.

Autistic people with less communication skills are left out of the community. Autistic people who are nonverbal are often not given a chance to participate in a group. I have been trying to make friends in the autistic community for a long time but all I feel is that I don't belong there and that these are not my people and not the kind of activism I want to join. 

Besides trying to interact all the time with autistics on social media, the only time I was able to get their attention was by sharing on my private account an opinion that was slightly different than theirs. I got tons of hate while autistic people are legally being electrocuted in order to change their behaviour!!! I got tons of hate for sharing that I don't mind wearing the puzzle piece symbol while we are still being denied accommodations in Schools and Universities. Why isn't anybody talking about this? Why is it that the autistic community will only interact with me when I say something they don't 100% agree with, even when I am just a University student who has absolutely NO power on how the world views autism? When I am not fucking defending eugenics y'all.

Autistic people with less communication skills are left out of this community all the time, including me. Autistic people who don't agree 100% with other autistics opinions' are left out, are given hate and being ""cancelled"". Autistic people who have more difficulty with communication are not seen on social media, are not included in the groups. Because as much as we try, the autism community is only truly opened for people who can hold a conversation, for people who can share their views on things in a great way and for people who can seem more neurotypical. 

The Autism Community is not a Community. This makes me sad and upset. If this text is confusing, I am sorry, as I said, communication is hard for me and I am just truly upset with the realisation that even autistic people are not always inclusive, are not always accepting. You need to do better, we need to do better. You need to support people with less verbal skills like me and people who have more difficulty maintaining friendships like me.

I am going to try and make this as short as possible but I usually ramble quite a lot. I was diagnosed some time ago by my therapist and after that I went through a bunch of tests with a neuropsychologist and then finally yesterday I saw my psychiatrist who confirmed „verbally“ my diagnosis. 

Where I live, in order for you to access and have rights as a person with disability you must have a paper that says basically „Hey, I am a doctor and I confirm she has Autism“. But he did not give me one. I asked him if he would give me some kind of document and he said no.

I do not think I will need any acommodations in University (which I am starting soon) or work but I think it would be quite nice to have this paper in case I ever need it. I do not want a government fund for people with disabilities or anything, I just want a piece of paper to confirm that I actually have a disability. 

I think the reason why he did not give me this paper is because I am already 18 and „high functioning“. But man, this whole process was truly stressful and expensive from the moment I was told I needed further evaluation for autism and in the end I am just going to get someone saying „yeah, you are autistic“? And not even get a confirmation on paper? I struggled a lot growing up and just because I am verbal and can function it does not mean I am less valid of an official diagnosis and services for people with disabilities (I do not even want services or acommodations, but I feel like this is how my Doctor is thinking). 

I need help advocating for myself and telling him I want a paper with my diagnosis on it. I feel like at this point – after having over 6 months of consults with him – it would be way too draining to look for another Doctor. Also financially I am broke. 

I do not know how to bring this up. I thought maybe I could talk to my therapist (they both know each other) and she could maybe talk to him. I do not talk a lot, I have a very hard time advocating for my needs and I struggle a lot because of this. I feel like I am not even making any progress at all because I should have been able to bring this up during our consult but I just stood there while he said he would not give me a diagnosis. I feel like a failure. I am very bad at communication, I am feeling like this whole process was a waste of money, time and mentally draining (not only did I have to go through a bunch of tests but I also had to talk to my parents and it was really hard as I had to open up about so many things).

I am seeking advice because I am extremely ashamed of my scars. I can say they completely rule my life. I am not ashamed of self harm because I know why I did it and I know the reasons that led me to it and I still do it anyway lol but I am so afraid/ashamed of people seeing it and knowing such a personal part of my life. My parents found out 2 years ago but I still cannot possibly handle them looking at my scars. I have worn wristbands since I was 13 and I will not take them off for anything.

I love to hear your voice read a bedtime story to me, I love to hear you talk about how you feel when looking at paintings on the wall and television shows that I do not find interesting at all.

I am in love with you and I am so sorry I cannot say these words to your face. I am so sorry you feel as if you are not loved – by me and by anyone else. I am so sorry I cannot communicate through words coming out of my mouth. I am so sorry I cannot speak properly how I truly feel and what I truly mean.

My head is trying to comprehend the world all the time – it is trying to make sense of your facial expressions and everyone's around me.

It is trying to think of something to say in the middle of a conversation while keeping track of everything else that is going on. But my head always fails – it can never think of something to say. It can never work out the rules of social interaction, it never works out the in between, the unsaid things, the subtle signs.

I am 18 and even though I have been raised in a Christian family I was never really into all of it, mostly because of the way I was taught as a child and as a teenager. Whenever I was dragged into church with my parents, I felt like it was not for me, I did not feel comfortable, until now. I spent a lot of time trying to make sense of life and my own existencial crisis through philosophy, which honestly just caused me a horrible mental health state.

A few weeks ago I decided that it was time – ""decide"" is probably the wrong word because honestly it is more like I *felt* it, I felt that I was ready and opened to learn more and live a faithful life. I am really trying not to screw up with God, I do not want to pray wrong or do something wrong while building a relationship with Him. Do you guys have an idea of where I should get started? 

I have been praying every night and I have some questions about my prayers: I have a health condition that will not kill me but is really just annoying and honestly it has ruined my life quality and mental health. Doctors cannot fix it. Should I pray to God to cure it or for Him to help me live and cope with it? How much is too much of asking Him to cure me? Do you think that He can get tired of me asking or something like that? I thank Him everyday at night and when I wake up in the morning but is there more I can do? I feel like I am always praying for my health, for the health of my parents and just people that I feel like could use a prayer and I am worried that this might be too much to ask of Him? 

Do you guys believe He is capable of curing me? Is it wrong that I am always asking Him to cure me? I feel like I am using Him somehow and deep down I know I want Him to cure me but I also want to live a life with Him past my health issues. Do you know what I mean? I want to know He is always around with me, I want to have faith, I want to have a relationship with Him. But I also want Him to cure me.

At the moment I do not have anyone who I feel comfortable enough around to open up about these questions in real life. I have not attended the church this year but I am planning on going next week.

I started to have PVCs a year ago. Had a clear echo, EKG and stress test in December. Since then, I'm learning how to live with the health anxiety PVCs have caused me. Recently though, I began to feel PVCs during exercise. It's important to say that I haven't exercised in at least 8 months because of health anxiety. Also due to COVID-19, I spent these past months at home and did not move around a lot. 

I have a good diet and normal blood work. I noticed my PVCs don't have anything to do with the intensity of exercise. I can run 15 minutes on a 160bpm and I don't feel anything, but if I walk 30 minutes on a lower heart rate I might get one or two PVCs. I can ride the bike very fast for 30 minutes to 1 hour until I start to get some PVCs. Usually it's when I'm doing the exercise for a long time that they occur. It also doesn't have anything to do with my heart beating faster because I feel nothing when I work out hard. 

I am really worried about it. Other than that I have no symptoms at all that could indicate CAD or heart failure or something like that. I am quite reluctant to get another stress test because last time I had a panic attack on the treadmill and the doctor wasn't so nice. As I said, I haven't exercised due to health anxiety and my heart beating faster still gets me anxious and sets me into a panic attack sometimes. I don't feel ready to have one again so I'm looking for advice or reassurance. What could this be?

It took me a long time to make friends but by being friends with the right people I found myself becoming popular very quickly. Because I‘m very honest and clueless of what should not be said people thought I was very funny and „let me in“. Being an outcast for most of my life, being the popular for once was really amazing, I felt at my highest when I was with the group – even though I always felt like I was faking it and became very depressed at home. 

I became so good on the whole popular thing that I was offered some minor responsabilitied until I got the highest job in the group.

I found myself completely overwhelmed with the work, even though I knew a lot about the organization I was part of, I failed to do my tasks. I had no clear instructions – instead, I was the one supposed to give them. I failed completely. I have extremely poor executive function skills and my therapist thinks I have ADD as well. I didn’t do anything I was supposed to and also failed to work with my team as I cannot work in a group. I often had arguments with the person who was supposed to help me because he was totally abstract and often sarcastic, things that I failed to notice and understood as an attack. All of the friends I thought I had didn‘t help me at all and I ruined my reputation to the point where even when I could have continued in the group, I left because I was being criticized by everyone behind my back. 

I feel extremely guilty (it‘s been over a year) and sad that I let this happen. It was the only place where I wasn‘t left out. I often dream about my team, about the things I screwed up and I get on a spiral of thoughts that seems impossible to get out. How do you work through your mistakes? Specially your „autism“ mistakes?

2334,yes,UnsentLetters,2020-10-20 21:30:07,linguisticshead,I think I am falling for you too.,"We have been friends for a year now – or at least I assume. I do not know for sure when you stopped hating me for my lack of responsibility that caused you to be overwhelmed with work. Trust me, I still feel as bad about it as the day you filled my phone with angry messages and I filled yours with empty explanations of my poor executive function. But you were never able to say these bad things to my face, even though you would be screaming at anyone if they caused you a minor inconvenience. And we can both agree that I caused you a lot more than a minor inconvenience.

I should have known you felt something more. If my brother were here, he would certainly be laughing at my face for being so naive. But you know me, I am literal about absolutely everything. I do not understand facial expressions, body language and even actual language sometimes. I do not get jokes, irony... basically the whole autism combo. Specially if it comes from you – you are always so abstract. 

I remember the night you got drunk and told me that you were into me, that you were falling for me. Sorry it took you saying *""I want to fucking kiss you""* for me to understand what was going on. I do not think you wanted to be that direct, but gathering your abstract sentences and puzzling them together to get the whole idea is not an easy job. If at least my brother were here, he would help and maybe I would know how to correctly respond to you, maybe I would know correctly how I feel about you. But he moved away, which means I have to figure things out by myself. Spoiler: I am not very good with communication or feelings.

You forgot about that day and so did I as you told me to, but something changed. It was two weeks ago. You called me at 11PM as we do every single night, but I was very tired and jokingly I asked you to read me a bedtime story, I did not think you were actually going to. You are dyslexic, you are not a big fan of reading. But you did. You picked a book and you read it to me until I fell asleep. You also did not randomly pick a book, you picked a book called *Wonder*. You probably thought I was already asleep when you said that you know I have a hard time accepting my disability and that is why you wanted to read that book for me – you want to help me accept who I am.

Something changed after that night. I woke up feeling different and it took me a while to make sense of what I was experiencing, but I did: *butterflies in the stomach.* I finally feel it. I can finally say it.

I am having a really bad week, with a lot of PVCs and I was just looking online on this youtube channel and found a lot of negativity. 

Trigger Warning: Things such as people saying they'll never get better, that they've completely ruined their lives, that they're incapable of exercising or doing normal things, that the PVCs have evolved to become a more serious heart condition and I am just devastated. I am only 18 and I am healthy. I just feel hopeless that this will never get better, that throughout my whole life I will continue to suffer from those and I will never be able to exercise again, never be able to have a normal life again. I had tough teenage years, wanted to die for the most part but just as I started to feel like I've found my place in the world I just get all of this negativity and all of these PVCs with no cure.

I am little bit new to autism as I was diagnosed about a year ago and I think I might have read somewhere that it is common for autistic people to not enjoy exercising. Is it true? Do you girls feel the same way?

I find that it is extremely uncomfortable to hear and feel my own heart beat. I don't like sweating and I hate gym clothes. I also live in a very big city with very few parks and spots where I can quietly walk through. It is also very dangerous around here, so as a girl it is definitely not safe for me to be alone and also not safe for me to wear my noise cancelling headphones around, which doesn't make just walking around hard, but doing basically anything outside of my house. I don't like exercising in groups, I tried group biking and running and I hate it because of all the small talk you have to do in between, people being behind me and having to go on the group's pace.

I am wondering if any of you out there have the same experience as me and if you do, how do you cope with it and if you could share a little bit. I feel quite guilty that I don't exercise because I know I should, so I am hoping to find some alternatives. How do you deal with the sensory input, specially when it is summer?

But there are somethings that I want to say before we further our relationship. Theoretically, you probably know all of this already, but writing some paragraphs online seems more convincing than having a dialogue inside my head with you.

I do not believe in heaven or hell. Let's be honest: the concept of living forever is just as scary as dying. The concept of living in heaven or hell makes even less sense. I know there is a mystery involving our existence. Maybe we will never really die or maybe we will never live as we are today. We cannot just be here, but I do not think none of us will ever find out.

I do not go to church. I do not like it there. It is loud and crowded. People pray so loudly and I really do not understand why. I do not like the groups, I do not like joining people and praying together, it makes me uncomfortable. I feel judged at church. I feel that if they found out that I am gay, no one would like to have me there anymore. I prefer you and I, you know? Like pals, like mates. I can talk to you and there is no judgment. I can thank you for the good things that happen in my life and I can also be angry at you if something goes terribly wrong, it is okay to be mad at you for awhile, isn't it? I am sure you understand that. I hope you understand that.

I am angry at you about my family. I really am. My mom will have it really hard when I come out. I cannot possibly imagine what my dad will do. He might hate me, he might respect it within time, but he will never come around with the fact that his only child, is a lesbian. And his only daughter wants to get some tattoos to cover up all the scars she has on her wrist from the time she was trying to deal with the discovery of her sexuality. His only daughter does not like dresses or cropped t-shirts. His only daughter prefers ties, suits and masculine clothing. It would save me so much suffering, so much sadness, so much effort if they were simply okay with who I am.

I am not angry at you because of my anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder or my autism spectrum disorder. I can deal with that. Or at least, I am trying my best – even if my best means stealing anxiety pills from my mother's cabin. You understand that, don't you? But I am really angry at you about my physical health issues that do not seem to go away even though I am in perfect shape, even though I exercise, even though I keep my diet clean. These are the things that make me angry at you. I am angry at you. I wish I were healthy. I wish I could be who I was last year. But I cannot, because these issues will not go away no matter what I do. No matter what I try. I am just 18.

I know there are many things that hurt me at the moment and maybe I will never understand why they are happening to me. But it helps to believe that you have some purpose for all of this suffering – that you know I can handle it. I do not understand you – and maybe I never will. But I want to believe in you.

I‘ve had PVCs since last year in July after an extremely long period of stress, alcohol and anxiety. That was the beginning of my health anxiety. I rushed to the ER so many times in between that 6 months I can‘t even remember. 

I thought my PVCs had finally stopped because I was over four months without having any episode and I was doing very great. Until I started to take antibiotics a month ago for a bacteria and I had my first episode in months. They haven‘t stopped since then. I am also terribly emotionally unstable at the moment which I believe could have made them worse. 

I love to exercise, I love to ride my brand new bike, but my heart health anxiety made it impossible for me to ride on it since last year. I finally had the courage to do so and one hour into riding I started to get PVCs again. It felt like my world was falling apart. I don‘t know if this was just a bad moment for me to go back to riding the bike since I‘ve experienced a few episodes in the past week or this is my heart getting too distressed while exercising. I‘ve never had ectopics while exercising before. This was the first time. I haven‘t even exercised today for hours and I‘m still getting them. I even took some anxiety meds to see if they helped but it doesn’t look like they will. 

I am an 18yo girl. I am healthy. I‘ve never had any health issues and I was an athlete until last year. I have had multiple ekgs, an echo and a stress test.

I haven‘t had any alcohol in 8 months but used to drink a lot. I started to feel really strong ectopics last year in July. I had a clear stress test, ekg and echo in December. 

The ectopics caused me extreme health anxiety and I completely stopped exercising. I used to ride 14km everyday on the bike. I haven’t really exercised in over a year but I am trying to get back to it now.

I was a very long time without feeling any ectopics but have had some of them for the past weeks. They eventually come and go. A few days ago, I was riding the bike for one hour not very hardly when I started to get a lot of ectopics. I made a 10 minute pause and didn‘t get any of them and then I was back on riding for 15 and got a few more. I was also riding on a very bumpy road so I‘m wondering if that worsened them. I‘ve been trying to exercise everyday for 10 minutes despite my anxiety (exercise really triggers me) and I have never experienced ectopics during these times although my heart will go up to 190bpm. 

I also can‘t tell if they‘re really ectopics because they aren’t nowhere close to the ones I was experiecing last year. It doesn’t feel like ectopic, because I just get this weird feeling in my neck and it doesn’t go away quickly like the normal thud on my chest I used to feel, so I‘m wondering if I‘m just overly aware of the blood going through my neck because I am so anxious?

I'll try to make this as short as possible, I'm an 18yo healthy girl. My symptoms of GERD started in January this year. I didn‘t look for a doctor although until in March when I began to experience a lot of pain in my lower oesophagus (close to the stomach) while swallowing.  It feels like the food is made of thorns and it hits against my oesophagus when it's about to go in the stomach. Also the pain doesn't go away right after eating but it gets better with time. I was in so much pain that I lost 10kg because I couldn‘t eat.

I was on GERD medication (omeprazole) for a month which helped my GERD symptoms but had no effect on the pain. I had blood work and everything is fine and I had an endoscopy about 2 months ago and it showed nothing except for some Gastritis on my stomach and I tested positive for the H Pylori bacteria, it also showed no signs of reflux. I was on antibiotics and now I have to wait a few months to get an endoscopy again.

But the pain doesn't possibly go away. Sometimes it gets better for 15 days to a month but all of a sudden it gets so bad again and I can't even swallow water because it hurts. Burping hurts, eating hurts, crying and laughing hurts. My doctor can only see me in a month but he also doesn't know what's causing it, he said it would probably go away with time but it didn't. He also thought it could be caused by the H Pylori but apparently it isn't because the whole time I was on antibiotics and now it didn't change anything. Does anybody have an idea of what this could be? I am getting really depressed. I just want to be able to eat again.

  I have like 3 people on my FB who recently start posting stupid crap about Christianity. So first time this happened to me was around 2016 or so. I had a friend back then that had been my friend for about 4 years. We went to the same middle school and friended each other on FB. We never really talked out of the blue in 8th grade. We hung out a few times and she admitted to having a crush on me. She is a lesbian or ""was"".   
 Anyways, We were 17 in 2016. Our last conversation was about her going to a church camp and how religion made her feel wrapped up in a blanket. At the time, I was kinda religious (not anti-LBGT) and agreed that religion makes you feel comfortable. A few years later, I realized she unfriended me on FB, became super Catholic, and married a man. What? How did she fall for this shit? I'm confused as to why someone would think being gay is worse than the shit TCC has done. I mean TCC (and others) have committed mass genocides, and are full of SA against women and children I can guarantee anything you do that makes you feel shameful is not worse than that shit. Whatever though, to each their own.   


Then I had another friend from middle school recently ask me for money so her dumbass church can grow more. Now this same friend is asking people if they want to study the Bible with her and shit. I want to unfriend her, but we still talk occasionally. I just know how sneaky these born-agains can be. She's either born-again or getting more serious about it.   


Then my cousin who is struggling with addiction started posting Bible verses like crazy. Ugh! Where is the real help for addicts?! Goddamn.   


Then I have another cousin (a huge POS by the way) posting all these crazy spiritual whole foods kinda shit. you know those right-wing hippies who are vegan but huge conservative Christians? Yeah, this bitch. She's literally a narcissist so I guess this is the perfect religion for her. Anyways, she sends me a video about how God can fix your life and shit.   


Omg, it's like I'm drowning in my old friends/family ""finding God"". Why do people fall for this? I'm so confused and mad. 

Would unfriending them all be dumb? I'd do it just to do it even if I don't actually want to do it. I know they'd do the same to me.

I often find myself changing my mind. I'll join [r/childfree](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/) and other childfree groups. I'll post about not wanting kids and read about other child-free experiences. At the same time, I find myself fantasizing about having a family. I don't find myself fantasizing about work or being a DINK. Doesn't this mean I want kids? I like the slow-living idea. Ideally, I would like to be a sahm/housewife on a homestead with a big family. I would homeschool my kids but have some sort of side hustle to make my own money. Homesteading would allow me to sell the things I grow and make things like goat milk soaps, or whatever lol. I just like the idea of taking care of a family and home. My number one fantasy when I daydream is being a sahm. I know not every day will be perfect, and I know that it will be a lot of work, but I think it would be worth it in the end. A big fear would be my husband or a child dying. Feel like I should add this.

I find the child-free life to be empty. I tried to fit it with what I wanted. IDC about losing sleep, I have insomnia anyways and will lose sleep with or without kids. I can travel with the kids if I want. I can work if I want. Nothing about being child-free really appealed to me. I'd rather have hard days with my kids than hard days with shitty co-workers and a boss. I care about nurturing a family and having a house with chaos. I care about creating valuable members of society. I want to be remembered as a mother and possibly a grandmother. To look back on my life and see my children, house, and husband. I want to create a home I didn't have and create childhoods I never got.

If you're on here and find yourself fantasizing about being a parent then you probably want kids. I can't believe I tried to ignore my fantasies. If you were on the fence but had kids, did you find yourself with the same fantasies? If you're child-free, do you have these fantasies?

A while ago, I saw a post on Twitter. It was a picture of a fake 1 million dollar bill and the caption read, ""I'm so fired"". The joke was obvious to everyone else- a cashier that took a fake bill thinking it was 100 dollar bill. My dumbass? I thought he worked at a fucking factory where they made the bills and he printed the wrong bill.  Technically a vague posting like that can be interpreted anyway but why do I always miss the obvious? I also questioned myself because I'm pretty sure money-making factories aren't a thing where people put the print on the money..   


This way of thinking usually happens when something is vague. Seems like everyone instantly gets it but my brain goes so far from it. Another time, my professor asked us something along the lines of, ""How are two people behind each other but see each other?"" He was basically testing us. So I went further outside the box because that was this test he was doing. I said, ""because the laws of physics don't apply"".  It's because they were standing behind each other.

I feel like I'm missing out on living my own life because I have to stay behind and take care of my family. I'm 23 (almost 24) and have never been on a date. My mom wouldn't allow me to date till I was 18 and I've never met anyone. I started working full-time at 19 with no car. I had no time to make friends or do anything. I worked full-time till age 22 and decided to start college. I'm in my second year of college and plan on finding a part-time job. I'm also helping my younger siblings with their homeschool work. 

I recently got a car which is a good step toward socializing. I just don't know where to start with finding social groups. I feel so left out. My friend, 20 is engaged and will be graduating from college next year. My other friends have families and careers. Me? I live at home and am still in school. If I was born into money, I would've had a car at 16 and started college at 18. I could be in grad school right now! Instead, I'm helping my single mom out by taking care of my siblings and using my savings and pell grants for food and bills. I just feel left behind.

I get it maybe 1-3 times a year. This year, it's been super heavy and I have the worst cramps ever. I feel the cramps in my back and legs, and inside my vagnia. Now I'm thinking I have PCOS, but it could be something else. I'm not sure though, I hope to find out when I have my appointment. I'm just curious to know what exactly your symptoms were. What do I tell my gyno? Can symptoms be headaches and things outside of the vagina? Should I only tell her about my vaginal problems? 

I also had a 2-week period in September and am currently on another period. I plan to tell her about the heaviness, the cramps and the inside vagina pain, the spotting, and the length of my periods. Another thing, I've always been fat. I lost about 50 pounds in 2019 and then regained it all back 2021-2022 plus 5 more... So now I'm the fattest I've ever been. Is this worth mentioning? I only ask because my weight gain was more from emotional trauma over something that happened to me in 2020. I've also noticed my curly hair has gone straight and is very stringy and thin. Idk if this is PCOS or what.  

Should I tell her about everything? Does a gyno diagnose PCOS or is it another doctor?

I've also been dealing with acne. I went to a dermatologist in 2019 and he said it was inflammatory acne because of sugar. I was fat during this time. After I lost weight, I went back in 2020 and he said it should go away in 2 years. I still have acne. I'm 99% sure he only said that because of my weight.

2435,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-03-21 06:51:01,HofmansHuffy,I have to face the reality that I might not be autistic.,"TL;DR I most likely don’t have autism like I thought I did, and I feel really bad about it. 

Edit: Corrected word usage; signs of autism show in childhood, not infancy 

The past year, I’ve been experiencing a lot of mental turmoil because I convinced myself that I was autistic. 
I was diagnosed at the age of 10 with bipolar 1 and ADD (now considered ADHD). I very easily accepted the ADD diagnosis, but I hate to admit that I’m bipolar. 
For most of my life, the people around me made me feel ostracized when they learned of my bipolar dx. And no one was ever even half as understanding and patient with me as they were when I told them I thought I was autistic. All of my outburts of anger, all of my depressive or manic episodes were made out to be a personal failing of mine. I would tell people that I couldn’t help my anger and they would tell me I just wasn’t trying hard enough, or at all, to manage my emotions. And while yes, I am responsible for how I react to negative emotions; it was as if everyone was telling me that I was wrong for experiencing emotions so intensely. Until recent years, I couldn’t make friends due to my impulsiveness, aggressiveness and my general lack of emotional regulation skills. Being bipolar has only ruined my life and I think I just wanted to be anything other than that. I thought I was autistic because the more I learned about the symptoms, the more it sounded like what I experience day to day. But the key difference is behaviors and symptoms starting from childhood. Both my parents don’t recall me showing any of those symptoms as a child. So I think I’m facing the cold reality that my original diagnosis is accurate. 
I feel like a fraud for ever believing I was autistic. And I feel like a fraud in this subreddit. I told everyone I’m close to that I for sure have autism. Now that I have considerable doubt, I feel afraid to tell them I was wrong.

This world wasn’t made for me and I’m not supposed to be here. I’m convinced no amount of resources is ever going to help me become a functioning member of society. I just want peace and quiet in my mind. But I’ll never have that.

We’re all up watching the Macy’s Day Parade on tv and the moment the LGBT Pride float appears on screen, my brother and dad change the channel to the World Cup, which is being held in Qatar. To my understanding, Qatar has a history of anti-lgbt laws and is known for being anti-lgbt in general. This affects me a lot because I’m pansexual and I’m positive my family knows this. My parents’ and brother’s political affiliations aren’t important to this rant, but for context, they are all staunch Republicans; my dad being of the MAGA/Tucker Carlson/Fox News viewing variety. 
As I’m calmly explaining to my brother that I wanted to watch the Pride float at the very least, he dismissed it as “just a fuckin parade” and “it’s being recorded so you can just watch it later”. But when I pointed out that the soccer game could be just as easily recorded and viewed later, he scoffed and said “This HAS to be watched live.” My dad of course didn’t try to compromise and my mom conveniently “wasn’t paying attention” as she’s famous for doing when it comes to calling out my brother. (As you can probably tell, my brother is the ‘golden boy’.)

2447,yes,AutisticAdults,2022-09-21 08:22:54,HofmansHuffy,Hello again everyone! I was wondering if I could get some feedback on my list of reasons I think I’m autistic.,"TL;DR I think I have autism, but before I commit to the expenses of a formal diagnosis, I’d like y’alls opinion on whether or not I should go through with it, based on what information I currently have. 

So I’ve been compiling a list of behaviors I’ve noticed on here that have been pointed out to be typical traits amongst some people with autism. The more I’m learning about ASD (ASC {condition} for those that don’t feel comfortable referring to it as a disorder), the more I notice in my every day behaviors. I’d like to hear from everyone, but more specifically people who have received a formal diagnosis. This is still an ever growing list, but this is what I have thus far:

1. pattern recognition in shows/movies that immediately cause loss of interest when I can accurately guess what will happen in plots
2. Heavy eye contact avoidance
3. Hyper fixations of comic books, star wars and social injustice
4. Perpetually hyper aware of how I walk
5. Gets irrationally upset when plans change last minute or my routine is disrupted in a major way
6. If I lose stimulation in a conversation, I lose total interest in it and want to leave immediately. 
7. I tap A LOT. Tapping feet, tapping fingers
8. I have a subconscious need to twirl of play with my hair, especially when my anxiety increases
9. Delaying basic needs like hygiene,  living space cleanliness and eating so as to continue being stimulated in whatever I’m doing 
10. Completely forgets to stay in touch with people if they aren’t commonly near me 
11. While at work, I frequently shift my weight from side to side or I lean on one leg and make the other leg dangle
12. Very frequently bump into things while walking
13. I love lists
14. Intense sensitivity to/dislike of touch on my limbs
15. Extremely prone to meltdowns
16. Touches things while walking so as to not bump into them
17. Lack of emotional regulation skills
18. Tendency to go nonverbal, not always because I’m upset but more often than not, I just feel like I was wearing a ‘social mask’ and it’s fallen off, so I don’t feel like saying anything
19. Goes through phases over the course of at maximum a month at a time, where I only eat specific foods, then alternates subconsciously
20. Over explains everything 
21. Sensory issues with sound. I get very frustrated when I can consistently hear dialogue but it’s quiet enough that I can’t process what’s being said.

We are both almodt 30 years old, both on the autism spectrum, and neither of us likes eating vegetables. I dont mind most salads or bell peppers, and he likes mushrooms and broccoli. I tend not to like vegetables or fruits that are cooked (texture) unless we're talking starches or peppers and he hates just about every vegetable that isnt potatoes. My question is: how can we convince ourselves to eat more vegetables as adults? We both love cooking together but sometimes our aversion when it comes to veggies really limits our options for food.

Her issues are mainly that she doesn’t find any form of physical contact enjoyable most of the time. She describes intercourse as painful like she is having knives shoved in her. I understand that it hurts but she refuses to believe that it hurts me in ways even I don’t fully understand too. She will not try to meet me halfway and try to have a somewhat regular sexual relationship it’s pretty much all on her terms unless I am super extra needy. In the past she has let me have partners outside of our marriage but she did this mainly to let me have some pleasure. This was acceptable for awhile but now she has said absolutely not allowed anymore. The rest of the marriage is great, we barely argue about anything important it’s always something little to both of us.

I was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 7 and have been medicated up to about 21 years old. After which I had no health insurance and couldn’t afford care.

When I got to 30 I got rediagnosed with just bipolar disorder and at 33 I got on disability. 

Before disability I tried my best to hold jobs but every time it got repetitive or boring I ended up losing interest and either quit or got let go. 

My latest psychiatrist has noticed that I still have ADHD (which I kind of knew) and we both think my bipolar might be a misdiagnosis. I’m finally back on ADHD meds and slowly getting off the bipolar meds. I’m seeing progress in my mental health finally now feel confident I might be able to work. 

But I’m afraid of failing I heard there are jobs that are better for people who have ADHD. I have no experience beyond my experiences in life with ADHD, working technical support for a major dsl provider and running a small computer repair business. I also think working at a veterinary clinic might be good for me since I love animals. 

My wife and I are working on moving back home to Chicago. There isn’t much for work I can do in this rural upper thumb of Michigan.

If anyone knows of jobs I could maybe look into getting that are either in Chicago or remote work jobs please let me know.

2555,yes,Autism_Parenting,2023-05-24 01:46:04,StrawberryAngel34,The moment when strangers realize he’s different,"How do you handle “the look” from chatty/friendly strangers? You know, the moment when they realize your child is different? And they look to make eye contact with you to acknowledge. I’m talking about genuine people who aren’t reacting negatively, but there is a split second of acknowledgement that this interaction will go a little differently. (For example, they know why he isn’t responding when they ask him his name, and stop asking prompting questions and instead make cheerful comments and observations that don’t require his engagement per se. but are meant for him to overhear and be excited/happy.)

I either make sure I’m not in “eye contact” range and focus on fiddling with my son’s hair or just make sure I’m looking inconspicuously busy. I don’t know how to handle that moment. It’s like giving them space or a buffer zone for just a fraction of a moment to realize (and I want to stress it’s not negative… it just “is”).

My son will be 3 next month. He weighs about 27lbs, has outstandingly vibrant red hair, and big blue eyes. At times he can be very engaging with the people around us. He stands out, he’s got a whole ton of energy, and can sure command a room for being non-speaking. His development is one year behind, and that’s been consistent across the board. So he appears like a two year old. 

Someone will ask his age, and I’ll say, and they kind of do the math. He won’t respond to any questions. He’s clever and I know he understands a great deal of what’s going on around him though. 

Today while out for a walk, we saw another mom and her kid in a similar push car. Her kid was larger than mine but clearly younger. They were babbling with each other while she asked his age. Her son was 23 months (mine is 35 months) and in the awkward silence I said: “he’s autistic though” just before thinking because for some reason I felt …well I’m sure you all know. And she chewed me out for not being respectful of my son. She said he deserves better and I shouldn’t be saying it to perfect strangers and I took his dignity. I just non-confrontationally ended the interaction. 

I’m not sure if she’s right, or how to handle it again. I’m obviously terrible at saying the right things in awkward moments, so I want to prepare for it next time. With summer here we are out and about a lot more and interacting with a lot of people- which because of Covid, is brand new to him.

Recently (31M) diagnosed in the last year or so and have had a lot of revelations about myself because of it. One of the more specific aspects are my sensory overload/no spoons days. The days where I just wake up and am in such a funk that every little thing kind of sets me off. 

I can now put a name to it, which helps. And my wife also is on the spectrum, along with at least one of our kids (we're fairly sure our other is too but apparently it's next to impossible to get a proper diagnosis on girls...rant for another day) so there's some understanding in the house. 

My issue is, I don't know how to get myself out of it. My kids don't deserve me in that state, they deserve their dad to be patient and loving with them and not shut off and snippy. How do you guys cope? Or pull yourself out of that fog? I tell them what's going on and they, my wife especially, understand. Just feels icky and it's not who I want to be as a parent or husband.

I look down at the perfect moment to see my daughter laying on the floor, legs kicked out to the side and in the air, she’s grabbing her butt cheeks, and she makes the loudest fart noise her body can. I lose it. The elder is appalled and I’m laughing so hard I’m crying. Then she does it again. This time with a little butt lift as if the fart was so powerful it sky rocketed her off the ground.

Just an off hand comment and I was still eating it. This really upset my wife and we got into a disagreement that’s left another bad taste in my mouth. She said it upset her because I was being negative and devaluing the food our family was eating and that it was rude. I didn’t get that at all and just felt like her personal boundaries around other peoples feelings were lacking in that moment. I would have understood it being rude if she or someone else had cooked it and/or picked it out. However she had nothing to do with it. I don’t see how I was devaluing it by not liking the taste.

She has this little lap white board that she loves pulling masking tape off of. She brought it over to me which is how she asks me to add more tape to her board. Now while I’m putting on tape, I’ve been using it as an exercise in some patience and self control. She hates waiting for me to finish. In the past, id try to get her to repeat “I am patient” and redirect her grabby little fingers until I was done. I assumed this would happen again. But it didn’t! She went to reach for a piece and then stopped herself and before I could start in on the affirmation she said it herself!!! It took her like 3 minutes to say the whole thing but holy shit dads!

So here’s the deal. I have a level 2 2.5yo daughter and I’m her stay at home dad. How she treats and responds to her mom and how she treats and responds to me are complete opposites. She listens pretty well to me, will do things I ask her to, wants cuddles, initiates affection, and really it just seems like I’m her person. With her mom however. She yells at her, she hits her, she throws things at her, she doesn’t listen, and she more often than not denies any sort of affection my wife’s wants to give her. Obviously there are moments where I have trouble with her and moments where she clicks with her mom but those aren’t the norm. I’m with her 95% of the day, I understand what she’s trying to communicate and often have to interpret for my wife. When we’ve brought this behavior up to her doctors, they’ve always said not to worry it means she feels safe with my wife. They also don’t know the nuances going on at home. I think they are under the impression that there is more equality between the time she gets with each of us since we both always go to the appointments.

I’m still have issues with cravings but I’ve got some strong internal motivation and some coping skills. I used subs and other helper meds to help get through the wd’s and I’m off everything except for the pregablin and suboxone. The pregablin dose is low and probably isn’t needed anymore but I guess it gives me some peace that I might sleep through the night. Sleep has been awful the past week. I’m dropping a little bit of my subs dosage today. 

As for my emotions, I’m so much happier. Y’all this shit almost convinced me to blow up my marriage. I really thought I wasn’t in love with my wife anymore and everything she did annoyed me beyond belief. Then after 5 days of sobriety I found myself enjoying my time with her and not getting annoyed. I was so close to leaving. I had gotten my ducks in a row. That’s some shame I’ll live with for a long time. Our marriage does need a lot of work and she still does the things that irritated me but I’m able to have compassion now and see her as a whole human. I judged her so harshly while I was on k. I judged her parenting, her capabilities as a wife, and just everything about her. That’s awful. That’s not the kind of person I am. I typically want the whole picture before making any sort of decision about anyone. But yea there’s that. I’m happier now. I’m back to my patient, loving, accepting ass self. I’m seeing light in my marriage. I will say I’ve always been a great dad to my daughter but now I’m even better. I’m not gripped by so much weight over her asd diagnosis and full of dread about the future will look like. She’s just a toddler, the future will be what it will be and we’re gonna be alright. My path is sustainable now.  I’m still discovering who I am after 2 years of being away and growing in the background. It’s exciting reconnecting with things that I use to enjoy and finding new things that I enjoy, even dropping things I thought I enjoyed like gaming every spare moment of my day. Turns out I don’t like gaming all that much and I thoroughly enjoy keeping a clean home which is impossible with a toddler but that’s ok too. I’m just really really happy to be back.

So I’ve been watching the parent test. I’m close to the end of the second episode and wow. It got real real quick. One of the tests was seeing how each family had done in establishing boundaries with strangers. So they asked the parents to appear as if they weren’t home while they’re kids were and the producers hired an actor to go knock on the door and see if the kids would open it and then let them in the home. Some did and it was hard watching. Then seeing the parents reactions were even harder. One dad was questioning why they had to have the visual of that and he was understandable very upset and very angry. Another mom chimes in validating him and explaining why she felt it had value but something she said was “I have six kids and only two hands” and it hit. It hit hard. I realized my daughter takes up my two hands, my feet, my chest, all of me. I can’t say with any sort of confidence that I’d have capacity for another child any time soon. The plan was also start trying again once she turned 3. This year I’ve started missing the baby stage. I’ve missed their smell, the sweet sounds. I’m also really fond of my current one that I thought wow how cool would it be to expand on that love. I haven’t told my wife this. I will soon but idk how. I’m just really hurting right now. Im not perfect but I am a really great dad. I always thought there was a high chance I’d get to dad some more to a different person, grow some new techniques. I also understand she’s still young and things might calm down  and even if she calmed down half way, I’d still be reaching my limit. I love her so much andI I love everything about her and she takes all of me and then some.

I have a 2.5yo daughter on the spectrum. She is wildly independent and also a runner so when we take walks we put a little harness on her with a leash that we attach to our wrist. It’s definitely one made for the purpose of walking with toddlers. Anyway, she loves it and so do we. She gets to have independence and freedom to explore while we’re on our walks and I still have a comfortable level of ability to keep her safe. Also relevant to the situation, we’re Native.

So yesterday we were walking and someone walks by and says “wow, you treat your dog better than I treat my mine” and used a very sarcastic tone. If they were trying to make a light hearted joke they failed miserably. 

What’s pissing me off and still eating at me is that this grown person referred to my Native child as a dog. Like are we really still in 1492? My wife instantly went into momma bear mode and I had to wrangle her and the kiddo to just keep walking but wow. Being the voice of reason in that moment was hard and it felt so wrong. After walking up a block we all stopped and talked about it, acknowledging we heard it and that it was wrong. I’m just having a lot of trouble shaking that shit off and am worrying about her future, more so than usual.

Edit: I never said this was racism or that this wouldn’t have been said to a white person. I bring up my child’s and my race to point out there’s an extra layer of shittiness to this comment being said because Native people have been viewed as less than human for centuries. It’s historically normalized. I bring it up to show that there’s more anger involved. And let’s be real, there very well could have been an extra layer of comfortability to say this towards a Native family than a white family.",116,314,314,0.83,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='12hde4b')>,,/r/daddit/comments/12hde4b/if_i_werent_out_there_dading_yesterday/,False

I have a beautiful, loving, and just freaking precious 2yo. She’s a daddy’s girl for sure. So the doctors are hesitant to diagnose because of her age but shes been evaluating and they believe (as do I) that she’s on the autism spectrum. I have no issue with this. I’m just terrified for her because we live in a society that can be vicious. She’s incredibly social but social cues just aren’t her thing as of now. It’s made making friends really hard for her. I’ve noticed other toddlers at the park often just take advantage of her willingness to share and it breaks my heart. I don’t want to imagine what kind of heart ache she’ll face later on. I’m having issues with her mom getting on the support train also. She’s continuing to deny that she’s on the spectrum and I had to fight her tooth and nail to get our daughter evaluated. I recognized some signs because my brother is also on the spectrum but she just….doesn’t get it. I’m thinking you know it’s good to know asap so we can start racking up resources and support for her and us but her mom thinks we’re jumping the gun.

Got my tatoo about 11 days ago. It has healed super easily but i am concerned about two areas, one on the top and one in the middle, who appear to be more transparent than the others. 

Is this on purpose to aid creating the watercolor effect that i asked for or is this an ink flaw that will need correction? 

1st and 2nd pic is now. 3rd is the day after doing it.

About the tattoo itself, because I know it may be controversial, especially for USA folks (only realized it was after i got it and posted in neurodivergent threads):
I am Portuguese. 
The world is indeed a very big place with lots of different meanings for the same thing.
All my life, even before i knew i am autistic, I thought of myself as a misfit, and in portuguese that literally translates as ""não encaixa"" - - doesn't connect with, exactly like a puzzle piece. That doesn't mean I think myself as wrong, just means that the pieces around me don't have their connecting sites on the places where i need them to be to fit mine.

But I do have connecting sites, just like the colorful piece in my tatoo, they are just in a different position.

And again, i much rather be me, with all my colorful blotchy mess, than lose my colours just to fit in.

So, my tattoo, for me, is not about eugenics or victimization.

It is self affirmation - I am different, but I will not mask and lose my colours just to fit in, and whoever wants to make a connection with me is more than welcome, because my connecting ports are there (which in fact happened already, I am in a happy relationship with a wonderful man for almost 10 years, the only reason i didn't have one piece tattooed for him is that i don't believe in tattooing anything related to people other than memorials or something like that, because unfortunately life can change).

I just wanna show it here because there may be people amongst here who would like to express the same idea I did, without just plainly tattooing a rainbow infinite symbol.",4,0,0,0.5,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13sdkon')>,,/r/tattooadvice/comments/13sdkon/ink_disappearing_or_on_purpose_because_watercolor/,False

Different elements couldn't touch on the plate, no combination of foods, no condiments.

Once I hit puberty I gradually started seeking out new flavors and textures, and grew into an adult who loves spicy food and trying new dishes. I enjoy a huge variety of textures and flavors, anything from jellyfish salad to black licorice to whole Sichuan peppercorns. Basically everything new I try I can find it tasty if I keep an open mind. I find a lot of joy in trying new cuisines and my husband and I often eat out and make new recipes at home. 

Did anyone else go through something similar? I think maybe I went from sensory avoiding to sensory seeking, for my sense of taste.

This was through a local organization in San Diego, we didn’t originally realize he was rescued from the dog meat trade.

Our dog, about 5 years old, often growls and shows teeth at my 25[M] fiancée when he tries to show affection. This is my fiancée’s first dog, and while I am much more experienced, it took a few months for my advice to sink in: don’t stare at the dog while you pet him, don’t laugh at his growling/tease him— and back off when he clearly needs space. 

After the first rocky few months, my fiancée is generally abiding by my advice and always helps walk the dog and train positively with treats and praise. However, our dog is still very sensitive to touch from anyone except me. He clearly loves my fiancée, but still growls and snarls (quietly) in many everyday situations with him, and although fiancée is patient i’m a bit frustrated that our dog continues to show some animosity or distrust towards him.

I suspect our dog was previously abused by men, and as I was unemployed the first 2 months after adoption our dog became very close with me. 
Question is: please share advice on how to encourage bonding with a rescue dog from an abusive situation?

My parents who both live in the US decided they absolutely need to attend our marriage license appointment at the govt office here in Tokyo. We’re planning on having a “real” marriage with family/friends in winter of next year when his job transfers us back to the US. However, as I’m an only child and my parents are pretty old they’ve decided they just can’t miss out on this little milestone of the paper wedding.

Issue is, I think we’re making my fiance’s mother feel obligated to travel here as well for the marriage paperwork. She previously expressed that she really doesn’t care about this part of the process - but now that she hears that my parents will be flying out, she feels like someone from their family is “obligated” to show up as well.

I was a bible-thumping undiagnosed autistic with adhd, I was depressed, I was in a new town and my hormones were turning on. I was taught to believe sex outside marriage was sinful so in my black n white thinking I believed everything sexual was sinful if not in marriage and all contact with women had to lead to marriage because I felt sexual feelings towards women but I had no social skills and no one in my life to explain things. This was all, of course, overwhelming and It was around this time I split my personality kind of in my head. I now know the term masking but at the time I was trying to survive by finding the adult responses and choices and mimicking those. Over the years, my adult personality grew up, became an intellectual agnostic able to work and drive but the teenage personality is still there and I will frequently flip between them in situations, overreacting in a highly neurotic, petulant way then suddenly apologizing, accomodating and empathetic. My life is split this way too. Im high functioning in most areas except social and sexual. It feels like Im schizophrenic sometimes as the interests and desires of both sides are very different.

Im 32, self diagnosed this year formally -i finally excepted it and changed things in my life to accommodate it. I had a therapist years ago tell me she thought I had aspergers but I have a compulsive need to resist generally and resist authority especially, so I didnt listen or accept any help. 

I spent most of my 20's reading alot of academic, dense books. Even in high-school, English lit was one of my strongest classes. Ive always had an intuitive understanding of analogies, metaphors and later on I learned about rhetoric in speech and studied entry level linguistics. I know now that the reason is because most of all that is just repeating language patterns and repeating scripts with predictable meanings and interpretations. Add to that the knowledge of personality, defense mechanisms and primary drives. All of this makes sense to me because I want the truth about what is being said or written. It doesn't make sense to take anything literally.  

The adhd does account for much of all that I admit. The adhd has never been in question. 

Do you think Im less likely to be autistic because Ive never had a problem taking things literally or do you think its a learned skill most people on spectrum cant manage well but I just lucked out getting a special interest in something so academic. I grew up in super spiritual church and was super spiritual till my early 20s. My first major special interest was Christianity and specifically a personal spiritual connection to God so I was immersed in metaphor, symbolism and non-literal things from a young age.

I have another world in my imagination I escape too or I have extended imagined conversations with people in my mind. Ive never told anyone I know about this or about how much effort it takes for me to be present and resist the drift. Its involuntary and I can only resist so long before there's psychological consequences.  The ironic part is that Im not unhappy or sad about this. The drift feels good. There is absolutely no part of my brain that desires any kind of interpersonal connection with real people. Most of time I see the real world and the people like someone looking in from a shop window. Objectively I would agree it might be nice to have what they have but the incentives dont pay well. Ive focused my intellectual energy on work and specific real world tasks like a vehicle and an apartment which is taxing but the incentives inherent in those efforts pay off.

The survival instinct alone means the foreboding other we cant understand still needs a conceptual framework so we can control its affect on us. The degree of agency we recognize varies and our ability to use any knowledge about the other predictively or proactively is minimal but just purely intellectually figuring out there is an other that requires things from me is mostly standard.

My autistic side prefers the inner world and doesn't care much for anything outside but the codependency side takes the person or persons outside and creates attachments and obligations towards them. The result is a constant sense of being trapt in feelings and actions that feel unnatural and uncomfortable  but ones you can't end both because you genuinely dont have the interpersonal and cognitive skills to deal with them and the immense feelings of guilt and shame codependency creates when trying to break away are overwhelming and traumatic. For me the effect has been a like two coexisting personalities in my head. At 33 ive only found relief by being completely alone. I still cant connect with anyone without that attachment happening. 

I see others on here being able to manage connecting with others without falling into codependency so Im sure it was just a nurture issue.. It's the reason Im fairly ok with eye contact, empathy and such cause for years I was hyper focused on what made the people i was attatched to happy. My happiness and what made me comfortable didnt matter. Only the other mattered. 

My autistic side never went away though but at the time I didnt know I was autistic. I just came to have so much hatred and loathing at myself and those I was attatched to eventually I found a way to move to a different city and I just ghosted everyone and shut off that part of my mind.

2719,yes,dogs,2023-04-22 15:03:53,drzieglers,when does the anxiety stop?,"around five months ago, my family dog suddenly was dry heaving and his stomach was hard and huge - i immediately knew that his stomach had flipped and had my mom bring him to an emergency vet. the whole time i was hugging him and telling him i love him because i knew it was likely going to be fatal. of course when we get there they tell us that there’s nothing that we can do, and we had to put him down. literally 1.5 hour after my mom called me to tell me he was dry heaving, we were putting him down. it was one of the worst moments of my life. my whole family was able to come and we loved on him, hugged him, and he went peacefully. it was still really hard, though. i think about it every day. 

my problem: now i have terrible anxiety that it’s going to happen to my dog. about 2-3 times a week, an hour after he eats, i get incredibly fucking anxious and start feeling my dog’s stomach, making sure it’s not hard and large. even though it’s not, i convince myself it feels harder/larger than usual and send myself into a panic attack thinking that he’s going to die - my dog is my life, and losing him like i lost my family dog so suddenly keeps me up at night. sometimes i also get anxious with just normal things.

2728,yes,autism,2023-02-26 18:53:14,drzieglers,my girlfriend is leaving me.,"this is going to be a long one but please stick with me. i really need support and advice.

for context: i am 30NB, she is 30F and i am self-diagnosed autistic as of a year and a half ago.

my girlfriend and i have been together for almost four years now. she moved to be with me in texas from connecticut in 2020. i had a great job as a teacher's assistant at a daycare and i was doing pretty good for myself. unfortunately you all know what happened in 2020 -- covid. our plans were completely shot. daycares were one of the first places to shutdown and i lost my job immediately. i was receiving unemployment for awhile and so was she so we were able to use our money to live in airbnbs because getting an apartment without a job proved to be very hard. it was a struggle but we did it.

airbnbs weren't cutting it and we didn't have enough money after a few months, so i asked my dad if we could move back into the family house. for more context, my house is an incredibly toxic enviroment. my dad has always treated me and my whole family terrible. my brother, his girlfriend and their kid all live here too. my nephew is just... not a good kid. he steals everything, from our clothes and cuts them up, to sex toys, to my weed, to money in our wallets to the point where we had to get a bolt lock or whatever.

during this time here i regressed a lot and realized that i was autistic. everything got so much harder. i think you all know what regressing is and how debilitating that it can be. i have meltdowns almost every single day, i can barely eat food, i don't take care of myself well. my girlfriend has been an absolute angel taking care of me and learning how to help with anything having to do with my autism. it's been great. i've regressed more and more but she doesn't care and does literally everything for me.

the issue is this house. her aunt died so she had to go back to ct for a week for the funeral, and i was miserable. i could barely take care of myself. i don't have a job and haven't been able to get one for all of these years, a lot due to my autism but also because the job market here has been incredibly bad. she came back to texas and crying to me that she can't stand being here anymore. that she needs to go back to ct because she felt like a weight was lifted off her shoulder. she said she just can't stand being in this house anymore.

and her mom won't let me stay with them, no matter what. no matter how long it is. my girlfriend wants to work a full-time job for a few months and save up every single dollar to get us an apartment there. but she's leaving me. in a toxic enviroment. i'm suicidal every other day. i self-harm all the time. and she's just leaving me.

a part of me knows that it will be better for us in the end. but i can't take care of myself. my family doesn't know i'm autistic (i tried to bring it up to my mom, and she scoffed at me so i just left it alone), and so i'll have absolutely no help. my girlfriend literally helps me eat, brush my teeth, take showers, change my clothes. i literally need help to exist. she's not like this, she's just.. uncomfortable and anxious here. i hate feeling like my problems are worse but i have an issue seeing how she can just leave me here when i need her. i need someone. and i don't have anyone.

and i just want to die. i feel like it'll be so much easier if i just died. i wouldn't be in pain anymore. i wouldn't feel like this anymore. right now it feels like the best option. i'm trying to be okay with this. i am. but i just don't know what to do.

i have a lovely girlfriend who takes care of me and makes things a lot easier for me. she makes me feel very loved. 

however, when something happens (sensory overload most of the time), i tend to get upset with her. especially if it’s because of her, like this morning she made pasta from the night before and started heating it up. i’m very sensitive to smells, but it’s even worse in the morning. she did it without telling me and all of a sudden i could only smell pasta sauce and meat, which made sensory overload happen. i kind of snapped at her and was like: “we’ve talked about it. if you want to eat those types of food in the mornings, please let me know beforehand.” obviously i was not as calm. 

this caused a big fight, and my gf mentioned she felt like we argue a lot due to my meltdowns and sensory overload. i personally feel like she’s on the defensive and wants to throw her hands up and be like “i didn’t do anything wrong!” the thing is, i know she didn’t do anything ‘wrong’. it’s just how i react in the moment, and i’m not cussing her out and calling her stupid or anything. i’m simply just like: “i’m really upset because i told you how to accommodate me and you’re not doing it.” my voice is usually pretty angry but i never say anything mean.

2736,yes,slavic_mythology,2020-03-06 18:09:17,Zeego123,"A critique of ""Slavic Gods and Heroes"" by Judith Kalik and Alexander Uchitel","So I read a PDF of this book (sure as hell wasn't going to blow $150 on it) because it seemed interesting. It soon became apparent that the book, contrary to its title, does not explain Slavic mythology at all but in fact argues Slavic mythology never existed before Christianity! Some of the arguments seemed convincing (at least superficially), but others I was able to debunk from my own prior research. There's also a bit of /r/badlinguistics material. I'll provide some examples, I'd appreciate any help in debunking them. To start here's the thesis:

> Slavic mythology does not exist. There is nothing comparable to the Icelandic Eddas, the Irish “Mythological Cycle,” or Finnish Kalevalic epic poetry in Slavic culture.

This is how the book introduces its central thesis. The authors take the fact that the narrative aspect has not survived very well as proof that it never existed in the first place. This is an example of survivorship bias. While it is true that comparatively little of the *narrative* aspect of Slavic mythology has survived to the present day, the *ritual* aspect has survived Christianization astonishingly well (more on that later). These rituals were originally meant to celebrate *something*, but what that something was is the central question of Slavic mythological studies.

> The goddess Lada was created from the meaningless refrain “lado, lado” in Slavic folk songs.

This is just thrown in and not elaborated further. It begs the question: if the word is meaningless then where did *that* word come from? Do the authors expect us to believe someone blurted out ""Lado!"" for no reason and everyone else went along with it? This is one of the ritual elements that hints at the former presence of a narrative element. These things don't just come from nowhere, they are artifacts of something larger. Dismissing them as ""meaningless"" and leaving it at that is intellectually lazy.

> The later Slavic word for devil—chort—is derived from the same Germanic root svart- (“black”) as the name Svarozhich. 

This is an interesting hypothesis, but one that I've never heard before, and I'd like to see a more elaborate case made for it. The authors just state it without providing proof. How does the fricative s become the affricate č? In Proto-Slavic, č arises from k before a front vowel like i or e, it never arises from s. And where did the v go? I've never seen a satisfying etymology for this word to be honest, it's an interesting rabbit hole to go down, but the answer almost certainly is not svart.

> [Saxo Grammaticus's description of Sventovit in ""Gesta Danorum] bears a close resemblance to the existing stone statue known as the “Zbruch idol,” found in 1848 in the Zbruch River in Podolia (in Ukraine) on the Eastern Slavic territory. The statue was presumably drowned in the river after Vladimir the Saint Christianized this region in 988. This is the only known Slavic stone sculpture, and its close connection to Sventovit’s image is difficult to explain, given the purely local nature of all other Slavic gods. However, the Ukrainian scholars Aleksey Komar and Natalia Khamaiko proposed in 2011 that the “Zbruch idol” is an early nineteenth-century forgery produced by the Polish romantic poet Tymon Zaborowski, whose estate was located in the village of Zbrizh, near the place where the statue was found. This proposal would nicely explain the connection between the statue and Saxo Grammaticus, whose description of Sventovit may simply have served as a model for the sculptor.

Even if the Zbruch Idol is a hoax (which I doubt), it's not the only sculpture of its type that has been discovered. Four-headed figures have been discovered in archeological sites all along the Baltic coast, in sites associated with Germanic cultures and Slavic cultures alike. I will admit that Sventovit probably wasn't this being's original name (it's too close too Svaty Vit to be a coincidence), but his real name is lost to time. That's precisely why I find the Four-Headed God (whatever his true name is) so interesting: he was a pan-Baltic archetype whose story we may never know. There are no four-headed figures in Germanic mythology, so his identity is probably to be found in Slavic mythology.

> However, identification of [Gerovit] with Yarilo—a personification of male potency in Slavic folklore—is unsupported. Yarilo was mentioned for the first time at the end of the eighteenth century, and his image was clearly constructed on the basis of St. George, whom the Slavs called Yuri.

So here's the issue with this: the festivals of Jarilo/Juraj in Slavic countries, while nominally dedicated to St. George, have aspects with no basis in the Christian veneration of the saint in other nations. For example, a child is put on a horse and paraded through the town. Clearly these customs stem from some earlier tradition, but as with the Four-Headed One's obscure connection with St. Vitus, I can only imagine why they were attributed to St. George specifically. This is yet another ritual that hints at a now-lost narrative. The child riding on a horse is also present in the Czech [Ride of the Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ride_of_the_Kings) which I suspect also stems from the same ancient Slavic celebration, whatever it was originally celebrating. Another Slavic ritual, [the drowning of Marzanna](https://youtu.be/dMCm5vo1pYI), is probably the best-preserved Slavic pagan ritual, still practiced in essentially unchanged form today (she wasn't even equated with an unrelated saint!). Curiously, the authors don't mention Marzanna at all.

> Volos is called “god of cattle” (скотiй богъ, богъ скотьѧ), but the fourteenth-century Novgorodian First Chronicle of St. Sophia, based on one of the versions of the Primary Chronicle, calls this god Vlasii. The latter is the Slavic name of St. Blaise, derived from the Byzantine Greek form Vlasios. St. Blaise is the patron saint of cattle, and his cult became popular in the Balkans after the transfer of his relics from his native Sebastia in Cappadocia to Maratea in Southern Italy in 732. In 971, St. Blaise became the patron saint of Dubrovnik (Ragusa) in Croatia after Stojko, canon of St. Stephan cathedral, experienced a vision in which this saint warned the city of the forthcoming Venetian attack of 948.6
 The Rus’- Byzantine treaty of the same year was concluded after Emperor John Tsimiskes defeated Sviatoslav of Kiev, and it is conceivable that Sviatoslav adopted the cult of St. Blaise during his occupation of Bulgaria in 969–971. Thus, a Christian saint became a pagan Slavic god, just as St. Vitus did 12 years later, after the Great Slavic Revolt of 983.

An issue with this: in some Hussite manuscripts of the 15th century, the word ""Veles"" is used as a vernacular term for a devil or generic Hell-being. Why would a saint's name come to refer to a demon? This is to say nothing of the linguistic implausibility of ""Vlasii"" becoming ""Veles"" for no reason.

> The appearance of Slavic totemic animals (raven, swan, and eagle) and even of some mythological motifs (the Swan Maiden) among non-Indo-European peoples, such as the Turkic Bashkirs, the Mongolian Buryats, the Chukotko-Kamchatkan peoples of Northeast Asia, and even among the Native American Na-Dené and Amerind peoples of the northwestern coast, shows that Slavic totemic mythology goes back to a pre-Indo-European Nostratic or even Boreal past.

WELL THIS GOT VERY STAROSTINIAN VERY FAST. For those unfamiliar, Borean is a fringe proposal in some linguistics circles that groups together most/all language families outside of Africa. [Check out this diagram](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/BoreanLanguageTree.png). And here the authors are just uncritically accepting this hypothesis, to an audience that presumably has more expertise in mythology than linguistics and might not be aware of how controversial this hypothesis is. What does this have to do with Slavic mythology, the alleged topic of the book? Do they expect us to believe the Slavs forgot their Indo-European deities but somehow remembered their last common ancestors with the Navajo?

This book is not what it claims to be. It uses cherrypicked evidence to support the authors' preconceived narrative, and in the last few sections it randomly turns into pseudolinguistic crackpottery. The way it has been described online does not indicate its true content. I highly advise anyone interested in Slavic mythology to avoid this book.

2737,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-05-21 18:35:43,Zeego123,How to silence inner monologue?,"I (25m) have a nonstop inner monologue. I'm not in conscious control of it, it really feels like a separate person living inside my head most of the time. And it's constantly telling me that I'm inherently broken, that I'm not a 'full' person, that I'm a burden on everyone around me, that I have nothing to offer others aside from superficial 'niceness' that's a product of my fawn response trauma, that I'm incapable of relating to others in a positive way or contributing anything of value, that I wouldn't have survived into adulthood under natural circumstances and I'm only alive now because my parents created a sheltered environment, etc.

I have a lot of difficulty with deconstructing these thoughts because I don't really have any rational arguments against them, just emotional ones (which doesn't work with how I think). As much as I'd love to have a more compassionate worldview, these thoughts unfortunately seem logically sound to me. I just wish my brain would stop repeating them to me ad nauseam.

I was diagnosed as a child, so I've perceived myself as 'broken' for a looong time, and I've had this toxic monologue in its current form for at least a decade if not more. It's completely destroyed my self confidence, it's made me utterly terrified of going on dates, and it's lead me to sabotage some of my social relationships.

Has anyone here experienced something similar? And if so, has anything worked to silence it? I've been trying mindfulness meditation, but it honestly feels like squirting a water gun at the sun. I have less of a 'monkey mind' and more of a 'dragon mind'.

In both texts, ""limerence"" refers to a psycho-emotional experience that can potentially affect anyone of any background for a period of time; granted, Tennov's view is more positive whereas Wakin & Vo's view is more negative.

So, I'm curious, where does this concept of ""a limerent"", as a type of person, come from? Has anyone done a historiography of this?

There's so much here I don't know where to begin. I'll crosspost this to /r/badlinguistics because it covers a lot of that territory too, but I decided to post it here first because it's mainly about religion. I don't even know what to flare it with because it diarrheas on pretty much *every mythology and religion under the sun*. Some highlights:

> The legendary symbol for Nimrod is “X.”

Since when? I can find no other source online that corroborates this claim.

> A double X, which has always meant to double-cross or betray, in its fundamental meaning indicates one’s betrayal into the hands of Satan.

How can it have ""always meant"" that when the phrase ""double cross"" is unique to the English language and, according to Merriam-Webster at least, [was first recorded in 1834](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/double%20cross)?

> The type of human sacrifice involving the eating of the slaughtered human victims derived its name from the combined names of his uncle, Canaan, and the demon god Baal, the two names being combined to form the word “cannibal.”

Interesting, I didn't know the [native Carribean people](https://www.etymonline.com/word/cannibal) named themselves after characters from Semitic mythology.

And now we get to the fun part...

> Here is a chart to show how Nimrod, Tammuz and Semiramis has been handed down.

> 1. Nimrod Lord of Heaven

> 2. Tammuz The Pagan Messiah

> 3. Semiramis The Queen of Heaven

> “LEBANON” — BAAL, TAMMUZ, ASHTORETH

> “PHOENICIANS” — EL, BACCHUS, ASTARTE

> “BABYLON” — BELUS, TAMMUZ, RHEA, ISHTAR

> “ASSYRIA” — NINUS, HURCULES, BELTIS

So apparently Bacchus is Phoenician, Rhea is Babylonian, and Hercules is Assyrian. But wait, it gets better.

Some examples from [this comment](https://xp.reddit.com/r/CulturalLayer/comments/84bl39/ottonian_empire_vs_ottoman_empire_the_truth_about/dvobaf3/) by /u/Novusod:

> Charlemagne's reign as Emperor of the Romans began in 476 rather than 800ad as we are commonly told by historians.

This is a difference of 324 years.

> The Hapsburg family only ruled over the Holy Roman Empire for 300 years rather 1000 years that they claim through phantom dynasties that are just endless repetition of the same events over and over again.

This is a difference of 700 years.

> The proof is in the coinage. Those coins if they had dates on them would have been in the Reckoning of the Julian calendar with its' year 1 equal to 753BC. If you have a quote ""Medieval coin"" with the year numbered 1250 on it then that coin was really made in 497AD because that is by reckoning of the Julian calendar.

Ok, so this would corroborate the previous example because a difference of 753 years is close enough to 700. But then we get this later in the same paragraph:

> The dates have to be translated just like a language has to be translated. The Jesuits used this translation excuse to send the Roman empire back in time 1000 years. The5th century is actually the 15th century. The 1000 years in between only exist in the minds of historians.

Now it's back to 1000? Does this mean they added 247 years *in addition* to the 753? I'm confused.

> The black death that occurred in the phantom century of the 1300s was the same plague that struck Justinian in the East seven centuries earlier. These events actually occurred at the same time but the dates are wrong. The actual date of the plague was 447ad which happened just a few years before both Rome and Constantinople were sacked.

Using the traditional date of 1347 for the beginning of the Black Death, this is a difference of 900 years.

> Constantinople didn't fall in 1453, the city was conquered in 453AD which is 1000 years earlier than the history books tell us.

I am now in my 40s, and I'm in the process for assessment for autism.  I never even considered autism in that 20 year span. Don't get me wrong, I have narcissistic parents, and my family is dysfunctional.  But, during that time, I was looking at physical and sexual abuse as a cause for the DID. Even though I have no memories of sexual abuse, I turned my dad into the police for it. Spurred by a therapist. I don't know if I made this up or not, but my therapist kept telling me I was safe, and I told her I wasn't, that my dad was molesting me as an adult. I don't know anymore if it was true. It felt true at the time. When I finally told my dad no, or so it went at the time, my parents set the police on me. My parents wouldn't have set the police on me if there wasn't something going on, right? This has been a giant mess in my head for 13 years. I don't think I'm done yet, either. I think my point was I've really messed up my relationship with my parents and my family through all this. I don't remember any childhood abuse. When I started researching autism, it seemed sensory issues I thought were sexual abuse symptoms. Now I'm trying to figure out ""how bad"" I have DID. I thought I had really severe DID because I attributed every weird thought to an alter. Now I've accepted I'm just weird, and that's OK. Am I just highly dissociative, or is it DID? Is my zoning out dissociation, or is it autism? 
I have blacked out once that I know of, but usually I just get so into with what I'm doing, I just lose track of time.

&#x200B;

***Part 2***

The next time I awoke, it was to the jostling of the tail bed. I frowned as I heard barely hushed voices twittering around me excitedly. Occasionally I heard the dragon's deep voice rumble something but it was too quiet to make out. At first I didn't open my eyes. I just wanted to curl up in the pleasant heat and not think about what I had discovered earlier. It was still too raw, too strange, too surprising. The tail, on the other hand, was warm and comfortable, and simple. If I could just lie there and gather strength for a little longer…

""Look! They moved! They're awake!""

""Movement doesn't mean anything! River moves all the time in her sleep!""

“At least I don’t snore!”

“Hey!”

There was more jostling, this time enough to jerk me off my curled up position, and I yelped. Then I hissed at the three other dragonlings, all bigger than me.

“Welcome!” the bluish black one cried joyfully and jumped around. “Welcome to the nest!”

I stared at all of them. The bluish black one seemed to be so full of energy that they quivered even when standing still. They were the smallest of the three. The next smallest was about twice my size and was teal tinted gray and sitting like a cat. They looked at me with a sort of childlike joy that had odd wisdom in it. It reminded me of my grandma and how she used to play with me when I was a little child. The last and the biggest one was five times my size and was shifting their gaze between me and the other two. They were all larger than me.

The bluish black dragonlet jumped so close that I was startled.

""Do you want to play?"" he asked eagerly. Without waiting for an answer he hopped away again. I looked at the other two.

""He'll be back"", River said lightly. She trotted closer. ""How're you feelin'? Mother's been tellin' us to be patient and now you're here?""

""Mother?"" I asked before my mind brought back the image of the huge dragon. It superimposed itself on the real creature as he…she leaned forward.

""Dinner will be here soon"", Mother said. ""You can play beforehand with your siblings, if you like.""

Siblings. I looked at River. The more I looked at her, the more familiar she seemed to me. And her voice. It raised memories.

""Are you–?""

""I'm River! Hello!"" she interrupted loudly. ""The little one is Jaspis and she is Rose."" She inclined her head towards the biggest of the siblings who simply nodded. River turned her blue green gaze at me again. ""What's your name?"" 

I opened my mouth to respond, then closed it as my mind suddenly blanked out. I looked panickedly at 'Mother', led by a new yet not entirely foreign instinct.

""You tell us when you know"", Mother said. ""The choice is yours. And if you want, we can give you a name. That is also an option.""

Before I could reply, the blue black one – Jaspis returned with a long thick stick.

""I foun' i'!"" he 'shouted'. ""Wanna 'ay?""

I did but I did not understand what he wanted to play exactly. River seemed to sense my confusion because she leapt at the free end of the stick and started pulling. It started a funny looking tug-a-war between them, with growls and hissing included.

I found myself jumping off Mother’s tail and between the two, trying to make a grab for one of the ends. They both skittered away. Everyone laughed, except for Rose who trilled strangely but pleasantly.

Suddenly a loud 'whum' sounded. The game stopped and I crashed into the stick. Rose immediately got up and nuzzled my whimpering self away. My snout was only smarting a little, but the sudden end to the game had startled me and thrown me out of sorts. Rose's lovely deep voice assured me that I was okay and that now was time to eat.

""Go sit with Mother, we'll bring you something"", she promised. I was about to ask when the 'whum' sound coalesced into flapping wings. Two dragons, both larger than Rose but still small when compared to Mother, landed hard onto the stone floor. The cow and the moose they had been carrying made a squishy thud as they cushioned the dragons' landing.

“Food!” Jaspis shouted and trotted towards the carcasses. The smell of blood and meat was delicious. I went to follow but then the realisation hit me like a tree trunk in a waterfall. The viscera was leaking from the animals’ bodies, and already Jaspis and River were snout deep in them. My mind reeled against the idea. My stomach wanted to dive right in with them. The mismatch made me curl up in a ball of anxiety and confusion.

Then Rose was there. “I’ll get you some, you’re still just a newborn”, she said, brushing her tail against me  in a caresse. “Mother can then fry it for you. He’s very good at controlling his flame.”

I blinked. “He?”

Rose blinked. “Oh, I forgot. Things don’t work the same with us as it does with humans. How we refer to each other is often first a remnant of human sensibilities and later a habit. I don’t know if he really cares but you can always ask him.”

She walked calmly away. I turned to look at Mother. My confusion was either clear on my face or she… he had heard our talk. I trotted to him and sat in front of him.I didn’t know what I wanted to ask. All I knew I had questions. So many questions.

Mother seemed to notice because… he started speaking after a moment.

“Rose has fully embraced her new life among us, and only remembers her human life as if an engaging story,” he began. “She was not allowed to live as herself, and when an opportunity came, she was pushed to me. The good memories are there, carefully recalled and cherished, but the rest of it is a nightmare she desperately wants to forget.”

“River remembers more but her last years were full of pain, so now, in her new life, she chooses to live it to the fullest.” He gave a sad chuckle. “The pain is an echo in her body sometimes but it only pushes her to make the most of the time she has been given. The good times have become hazy as if it had been a pleasant dream.”

“Jaspis was a tiny child, abandoned to the elements. I don’t know whether by choice, by accident or by force.” He sighed. “I felt pity for him. There was no caring for him as he was, so I chose to give him a new life. He remembers nothing, but sometimes he wakes up from a nightmare and describes being alone, weak and cold. Only time will tell if those memories fade.”

Then he looked at me straight in the eyes. “You too, have a choice. You can remember who you were, you can let it change from memory to a memory of a dream, or you can let it fade away into knowledge without emotional connection”

“And the two others?” I asked. Mother smiled and shook his head.

“When you get to know them, I might tell you. Unless they tell themselves. They are usually more open about it to the new ones.” He shifted his body minutely. “And there is Rose with your portion.”

I turned to see her carrying a large chunk of raw meat in her mouth. I started to salivate. She dropped it near me and nodded before turning back and returning to probably get her own piece.

“Stay put,” Mother warned me. I hadn’t realised I had started for the meat. I stopped and the next thing I saw a burst of flame, followed by near billowing wind. The meat had cooked and it smelled incredible.

“Dig in,” Mother said, and I did. It was wonderful. It turned out the meat was not fully cooked, but the roasted outside and raw inside made a nice contrast. And it was all warm! It tasted amazing!

Once we had eaten, everyone started curling up for a nap. The two who brought the food wrapped around each other and Rose, River and Jaspis were entangled next to them. I decided to curl up half on top of Rose and River. The latter smiled widely and snuggled closer.

As I began to hear Mother shift and move his enormous bulk, I whispered to River.

""Aspen. My name is Aspen.""

She smiled, this time softly and affectionately. I felt more than heard Mother curl up all around us. I smiled back and closed my eyes.

2844,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-05-21 17:40:09,tinyghostdragon,How to tell whether the doctor assessing you is wrong/uninformed or whether you are misinterpreting your own traits as autism?,"Hi, everyone. This is pretty long, so bear with me. The TL;DR is that I doubt this particular doctor's ability to assess me for autism but I'm not sure how to judge whether she's right or whether I am, given her reasons seemed not great.

So, I had a doctor's appointment recently about me possibly being autistic. I've suspected it for about two years now, starting from seeing a bunch of relatable social media posts and then talking to my autistic friend, who said that she has been heavily suspecting that I might be on the spectrum or neurodivergent in some other way. Her then partner also thought so. 

So during these past two years I've been reading books, personal anecdotes online and articles, listening to podcasts or single episodes, doing all the at least seemingly reputable self-assessment tests I could find. And evaluating my past as well, of course. Everything indicates that it's very much possible, maybe even probable that I am autistic. I have differences in social skills and socialising is very tiring to me, I have sensory issues, I need a predictable structure to my life, I show signs of literal and black and white thinking, etc, etc. In short, I think I have enough traits to reasonably suspect that I might be autistic.

So I go to this appointment, not really sure what to expect. The things the doctor then asked me included whether I have a special skill, any intense interests, sensory issues, whether I have been bullies and what kind of sensory issues do I have. There may have been other things that I have forgotten. This whole meeting took about 30 minutes. Now, this doctor, who was very nice and polite, seemed not to be too familiar with autism and how it can present itself. She told me that to her I don't seem autistic because

1. I don't have major functional issues,
2. I have a Master's degree and am planning on getting a PhD,
3. I have friends,
4. I can make eye contact,
5. I can put my emotions into words.

My boyfriend and autistic friend thought these are crap reasons to think I'm not autistic. And I have to agree. Number #1 is probably the only thing I can agree to even on some level. Sure, I can take care of myself but I sometimes forget to eat and take a shower (until the dirtiness becomes a sensory problem on its own), and I generally have trouble with executive functioning unless I have a good routine going. Which I don't, atm, but that's not the point here. The fact is that I currently have low support needs, whether or not I am autistic or something else, and according to the doctor, that alone means that I probably wouldn't get a referral to neurological examination. She did say that we could continue with the process (for which I would need to get documentation from school, medical system, the lot) but if I'm still not likely to get a referral, I didn't see the point. Maybe I'll go again to a different doctor some day, with more preparation as I now know better what they want to know.

Numbers #2 and #3 seem like stuff that don't really work as arguments against me being autistic. My Master's is in the field of a special interest of mine (languages) and the PhD is going to be about languages too, if I manage to make it happen. And the friends thing just seems... arbitrary. My oldest friends are neurodivergent, so is my boyfriend, and my uni friends are from my field so we all know the same stuff about communication and language use, and of course we share the interest in languages. In short we have the tools to think about our communication with each other, regardless of our neurotypes.

Numbers #4 and #5 are partly covered by that language special interest. I've studied communication. But not just in uni. I remember as a child and as a teen consciously thinking ""oh, I should do this thing"", like make certain facial expressions, or tone shifts. My autistic friend even commented that when I'm relaxed with her, I have a pretty flat tone. As for putting my emotions into words, I've had to learn how to do that a long time ago. I'm FtM trans person, so I had to go through a diagnostic process for that in order to get medical transition approved. And more recently I've been in therapy to deal with a burn out triggered depression, so yeah. But knowing how to do something doesn't mean it's easy or that I've always known how to do that. The eye contact thing is something I can force myself to do (and I do force it) or I fake it by looking at the general direction of the other person, if they're far enough away.

One of my problems (in general, no idea if it's related to autism) is that I am really bad at telling about myself without being prompted with fairly specific questions, and sometimes even not then. It was likely a major hindrance here. Even now writing this I wonder what things should I include to make the conctext as clear as possible without writing a whole novel.

Anyway, given that it's often said that a professional should have a final say on the diagnosis, my question is: how do I know if they are a professional in this matter? How do I assess the validity of the evaluation? At this moment I still think I might be autistic but should I count this doctor's evaluation as a mark against the possiblity? I'd love to hear your thoughts.

2851,yes,TalkTherapy,2023-03-06 02:47:14,tinyghostdragon,I fired my therapist,"Warning: Likely very disjointed. Sorry about that.

So I just fired my therapist last week.

I had already thought about getting a new therapist a few times but after having to talk with him about what I need, it became definite. 

Firstly,  talked about reducing meetings from twice a week to once a week partly from financial issues, partly because I didn't think I benefitted much from two sessions per wek. He more or less was saying that no, he doesn't want to do that. I had asked him once already about it and then too the answer was negative.

Secondly, I said that I need more tools for everyday life and not just talking about whatever is bothering me that day. He then basically told me that he doesn't want to guide or direct me (sorry, we weren't talking in English so I'm not sure exactly which meaning he was thinking of) or tell me what to do. That I need to make decisions ""like adults do"", which set me off because it felt like he was implying my need for more guidance in stuff like recognising and managing my emotions was childish. That I was being childish.

He seems to think he's supposed to be sort of sounding board or he's supposed to get paid just to ask me some questions when I rant or vent and then I figure everything out by myself. But I can do that without paying anyone. It also made me feel that he thinks that I don't actually know what I want or need. And yeah, maybe I don't know exactly that but I do know I don't need whatever this is.

He did say that his job is to help me figure out why I feel the way I feel about stuff but then maybe he should have dug deeper and also not say that ""everyone experiences something like that"".

His attitude just felt sort of condescending or patronizing, come to think of it. So I'm supposed to make decisions like an adult but just adhere to his decisions and methods even though I disagree about their effectiveness?

So I decided that okay, this is the end. I sent him an email about it and then he replied by asking to have a phone call or another meeting to talk ""calmly"" about this. I felt angry enough that I couldn't reply to him immediately. 

I don't really want to talk to him anymore at all, partly because while he sometimes seems like he listens but sometimes it seems like he's only kind of not really listening to me. He sees what my issues are and what my problems are, but some of those I actually flat out said to him.

On the whole, while we agreed in general what things I need help with, we were ona a completely different page on the nuances. Like when I told him that I want to reduce our weekly sessions from two to one. I said that didn't feel I get any additional benefit for it and he said that we should keep going because sometimes I don't remember what we talked about or what's happened since we last talked. I do remember things that have happened to me, it just that I don't see any need to talk about like every detail about my life in therapy if there is no problem. As for what he talked about, or rather what I talked about, why should I remember a rant that in the end got no impactful comments in response. If there is a problem with remembering stuff I talk about, it's because, when I'm stressed enough, I focus so much on picking the words and getting them out that I can mostly forget what it was if there is nothing to attach it to. Like a meaningful response from the therapist.

Moreover, if he wanted me to talk about certain stuff, he could have asked to talk about them. I don't generally spontaneously talk about things that bothered me a week ago if they don't currently bother me, and he knew it. I had told him that. Or he could have asked about the previous session. Or something.

I also just realized that I have some minor trust issues which is probably also a factor in this whole debacle.

I don't know, now it just seems like we were not on the same wavelength. Looking back, I can remember a few occasions that a comment of his came completely out of the woods, and threw me off because I couldn't figure out how he got there. And I tend to go speechless if I'm surprised like that. 

Then again,a part of me wonders if I'm being unfair. That I should have said something and tried to work things out with him. But then I'm reminded that I had already brought up the reduction of sessions once at the start of the year, and that went nowhere.

I recognise that he tried to help me and in the beginning the sessions with him did help but now they don't. That's that. Now I need to find a new therapist.

I'm writing a haunted house horror story (or trying to) and I just realised some of my troubles with it may be due to having too many characters. I've been flipfloping with number the characters that are actually spending time in the house, that being between 5 and 8. At max number, 4 live in the house and 3 are guests. 

I guess at least some of my problems are due to 1) I'm struggling with managing these characters' interractions with each other (my first drafting phase is a little loose on character personalities) and 2) I'm struggling with creating the feeling of dread is when there is less chances for the feelings of isolation for individual characters.

All the characters serve a function in the story at the moment, but I think I could merge two characters somewhat (and put the non-fitting stuff into a tertiary character) and maybe have one character die either before or early in the story without needing to make radical changes. I've also been thinking about just not having all of them in the house at the same time, i.e. one guest at the time (for some reason) and maybe some of the residents having to travel, or something.

In the past few weeks (to be honest, since this new lady helper started working) he’s been written up twice and he gets kicked out the next time. Why? Because he tries to play with the anti-social dogs cowering in the corner. 

I asked more questions because at first I figured he wasn’t reading social cues and was an overbearing puppy (aka truly his fault). But no, he listens just fine and typically moves on to another dog who wants to play. 

The two times he got written up only a few dogs were there (not his usual buddies) and he had no playmates so he kept trying to get them to play. They admitted absolutely no aggression or dominance was seen, he was just an annoyance to the other anti-social dogs and they’ll bite eventually (and it’ll be his fault). 

I’m super confused. The other people who work at the daycare love him and say he’s an angel and actually get even get the shyest dogs more confident and willing to engage. Either way, shouldn’t the anti-social dogs be either kicked out of daycare or at least grouped together with other less playful dogs? I can’t imagine putting my dog in daycare if he hated it.

However, my 11 month Golden has been the most difficult of them all. To the point where I fully understand why people rehome their dogs. 

Despite training sessions throughout the day, outside playtime, “capture calm”, rotating toys, walk every day in the evening, “nose work”, etc, his behavior has just gotten worse! He used to be very chill until the evening (4-9). This was his bewitching hour. 

Now, he wakes at 5am and runs immediately to the couch to try and tear it apart.  He is always biting (hard) and needs constant supervision now. You could be in the middle of playing with him and he will stop and run over to the couch/ottoman to rip it apart. 

He’s an angel during training sessions (we even have nearly perfected “trade it” for his rock obsession), on walks, other peoples houses, and when others come over. 

He’s been to 4 outside training 6 week classes, had virtual behavior sessions with a trainer, and we have an in-person behavior trainer coming next week. 

Neutering (at 10 months) eliminated the aggressive humping behavior-would grab leg and growl/bite when you stopped him and left the room (thank goodness). But this other behavior actually got worse since then. 

I am at a lost with him. I am pretty experienced with dogs and never have I have seen such a difficult animal. I know his 1/2 brother and he has always been the most chill, well behaved dog and has never had any formal training.

I’m 30 and can maintain a good career and a roof over my son’s head, but I feel like I’m still stunted compared to my peers. 

I struggle with OCD tendencies, but not sure if it’s enough to call it OCD. I have to recheck things in groups of 3’s (oven, locks, windows, doors). At times I will get “stuck” and nothing feels “right”. This can interfere with leaving the house or sleeping. I try to hide it from others but it’s hard. Sometimes my family makes rude comments. 

I do have some obsessive thoughts/actions. When I was younger things were age appropriate obsessions just with extreme passion. Now, it’s certain tv shows. Doesn’t sound bad except I will binge watch the series over and over, watch clips of it repetitively, read stories about it, listen to music in those clips over and over, and talk about it way too much. I know I shouldn’t but I can’t help it. Even when I’m not actively watching it I visualize scenes in my head. The shows I obsess on are all similar (NCIS, Bones, X Files). I become stuck on the main relationship on the shows. 

I want to spend time with friends (limited honestly-all coworkers) and date, but I panic and cancel last minute. Especially when I don’t have a schedule or exact plan. Even a road detour on the way could put me over the edge. This feels like anxiety. 

As much as I want a relationship, the thought of having to hide the ocd/obsessive tendencies or having to do things spontaneously prevents me from meeting people.

Dr #2 made me feel bad about myself and while she gave me a spirometry test, she refused to do a challenge test (exercise or methacholine) after the base line was normal. I decided to leave her. 

Dr #3 has been amazing, however I’m embarrassed to bring up my breathing challenges with him for fear of embarrassment. The last week however has led to daily coughing attacks presumably due to poor air quality (AQI 120-140). It happens mostly in morning and at night. I avoid exercise as I know I will cough.

The previous owners put up a fence further in so the storm drain isn’t fenced in to make access easier for the city. 

Here’s the problem. Right after I bought it, we had a huge rain storm. Very unusual for my area. Normally it’s hot and dry here. Well, the storm drain couldn’t keep up and it over flowed just a bit. The city was called out and they put sand bags up on my neighbors side (I had some already) as he is about 6 inches lower than me and the water from the storm drain was going into his yard. The WHOLE city was flooded so it wasn’t just my area. Well, few weeks later my neighbor tells me he is going to sue me since the storm drain flooded and damaged the bottom part of his house.

And it’s not like I didn’t want to - things came up and we had busy lives (she was doing two jobs and going to school and I was hoping for enough spoons to get through the day). But we talked and I even sent her a Christmas card saying how proud of her I was for flourishing like she had. But when she passed I had that guilt of “you should’ve reached out more you should have offered to hang out you should’ve done this and that and x y z.” I always have this guilt when someone passes - I always wish I could do more or say more or be with them more. I’m used to the guilt.

And her boyfriend (ex boyfriend? Widowed boyfriend?) made this huge post on Facebook about how people who are posting on her Facebook in memoriam are being fake because they didn’t check in on her when she was alive. I know it’s not pointed at me but it still made me feel worse.

I know part of being autistic is failure or struggling to make and, most importantly for this context, keep friends. So it’s a struggle and I always end up thinking about people who I care about a lot more than I talk to them.

2954,yes,AskVet,2023-02-12 17:47:02,MoonyGraham37,My cat ate the smallest amount of garlic - should I get the vet involved?,"Details: my cat is 4 years old, spayed, domestic shorthair, she’s  probably 10+ pounds, and she’s extremely antisocial so taking her to the vet is a lot of stress for her. I also can’t really afford a vet trip just to hear them say she’s fine and I’m over-reacting. We also live in Connecticut, USA.

What happened:
I made dinner last night which calls for 1/16 of a teaspoon of garlic powder mixed with butter to go on top of what I made, which drips onto the plate. After I was finished I heard her lapping the plate because of the butter - I want to say 3 little licks - and then she looked up and started licking her chops so I imagine she definitely tasted the garlic. We looked at each other and I just kinda said “that’s…probably not good for you” and shoo’d her away from the plate. And then I looked it up online and apparently garlic is one of the worst things a cat can eat. Everything I’m reading says that 1/16 of a teaspoon per 5 pounds is fatal, but she’s 10 pounds and she only had a small fraction of 1/16 - just enough to taste it. Like. Literally maybe 3-5 actual specks of garlic powder.

Now:
I didn’t hear or see any vomiting and she’s acting fine this morning, but I know that it may take a couple days to a week for things to go wrong. Am I overthinking this or do you think she’ll be okay? I just need a second opinion besides my own.

I don’t have a caregiver (and most of the people who try to convince me they can fill that role are the people who trigger this regression which makes me think it’s more of a kink to them when it’s really very obviously not sexual for me) so I’ve been muddling through this on my own - does anyone else regress like this?

Like in Stranger Things, Eddie Munson was on the run for ??? but he was innocent. I don’t remember there being a threat of Vecna but I also can’t remember who else was around so who knows.
Apparently Eddie or someone had a grandma that could hide Eddie, so we all piled in a red car to go there. I volunteered to sit in the middle of the backseat because I wanted to sit next to Eddie (he was on my left side), but I didn’t make that part obvious. I remember the whole ride I wanted to hold his hand or give him some sort of contact and I was really trying to talk myself into doing it.
We had to stop somewhere (maybe a gas station?) to get something and again I volunteered to stay in the car with Eddie (since he couldn’t go in because he’s a wanted man). When everyone was gone, we kinda just vibed in the car together. There was a skylight or a overhead window and we were picking out shapes in the clouds (I think I found a hedgehog but he found a cloud that definitely had giraffe spots). During this, I plucked up enough courage to lean my arm against his and I remember just feeling really safe in that moment.
And then I woke up lmao

I know how Eddie got there - I have a friend that I kinda can’t stop thinking about that reminds me a lot of Eddie Munson, plus Stranger Things/Eddie Munson is everywhere right now, so that explains that. And the thought of plucking up the courage to hold this specific friend’s hand in a car was something I had thought about the day before, so that makes sense.

My relationship with food had always been tense. For context: I’m autistic and my sensory issues forbid me from branching out from my extremely limited palette, which I’ve been bullied about. I also fight with it because of the desire to be smaller thing as well, but less so.

The food thing hasn’t bothered me this much in years, but lately my anxiety’s been awful to me and the amount of food I ate in a day significantly decreased. Then I checked the scale for the first time in 6-12 months and saw that I lost weight and I kept checking it for about 2 weeks. I recognized the pattern and backed off but I still want to check it. And I’m still not eating like I used to - at first I thought maybe it was because I was getting older or the anxiety but there’s a thought pattern I keep falling into before I eat that makes me think that I’m actually having a problem.

I dunno. If you made it this far, thank you for listening.",1,3,3,0.71,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='vq6ks1')>,,/r/fuckeatingdisorders/comments/vq6ks1/im_new_to_calling_whats_going_on_an_eating/,False

Even though he was diagnosed as a kid, his mother didn't tell him until he was in his late 20s. In his 30s, he's struggling a lot. He does not seem to manage it well and will barely talk about it although I'm not sure he knows how to communicate what he experiences to those around him, including me. 

In the past, he's used discount clinic psychiatrists who diagnosed him with depression and IED, but only gave him an antidepressant and wrote him off around covid when the doctor shortage got bad. As a result, when things get bad, he self medicates with alcohol (in aa now). After moving to somewhere more affordable, it's gotten worse as he struggles to deal with change and is struggling to hold a job and fit in. 

I got him set up with Cerebral and helped him get his full medical history in there, but it is running us about $500 a month for a psych, therapist, and meds. They diagnosed him with adhd and gave him meds. We've not seen a change, but it's only been a month. The problem is, we can't afford to keep paying for it every month to give it the proper time to make a difference. 

My question is, how do we get affordable and consistent help in the US? I know it will take time with the right medical care and a support group, but the medical care part seems unattainable.

To non natives, the storms tend to be brief, but bring lots of thunder, lightening, and heavy rain.

When I first rescued her she would tremble during storms. She was very submissive and skittish. We spent some time helping her conquer her fears and by the end of the season, the trembling stopped and she would go to her crate or cuddle during storms.

Jump to now after a 7 month drought and the trembling is back, but it is worse and she now hyperventilates. She stares at the ceiling like it will come down. The storms could be miles off and not even have lightening and she still breaks down. It's to the point where I wake up to her trembling in the night and have to strain to hear far off thunder. She seems to be getting worse with every strom.

Nothing helps...we have tried sprays, neck pillows, jackets and not even the slightest improvement. I have a co pletely blacked out room where lightening can't be seen and it doesn't matter. The best we can do is hold all 50lbs of her, but it doesn't help.

I will return the favor.,"She stepped off the driveway onto the mixture of sandy dirt and Saint Augustine grass. The mixture of green and gray formed a narrow path between the stucco house and the neighbor’s chain link fence. She looked down at her new Adida’s with purple stripes. This time they were the real thing, not some knock off brand. The shoes were still perfectly white.  They would help her win for once. 

At the end of the path, there was a clump of three tall Florida pine trees. The lowest needles grew at least four feet above her head. A few feet to the left of the trees, directly behind the house, stood the tether ball pole and its yellow ball waiting. She rubbed her wrist, which was still sore from yesterday’s fight with her brother, Devon, for the remote. She would win that battle too. Maybe her Adida’s were good luck. 

“Hurry up Jenna,” yelled Abbie as she formed her hand into a fist in preparation. 

Jenna, with her frizzy orange hair and her green Tampa Middle School sweatshirt, had both fists ready. She ran up the path toward Abbie, leaving a cloud of dirt in her wake. Without unwinding the string, which was wrapped twice around the pole in Abbie’s favor, she hit the ball hard. The leather ball flew high above Abbie’s head and back within reach on Jenna’s side of the pole. Jenna leapt and hit again hard, bringing the ball to where the game should have started.  
Mom’s muffled yell made its way into the backyard. Her brother yelled back. Abbie jumped and hit the ball. It went flying quickly in the other direction. This time it was at its highest above Jenna’s head. 

The word ‘bagel bites’ and ‘mess’ was all that could be deciphered from her mother’s increasingly loud yells. Abbie tried to hit the ball again to keep it out of Jenna’s reach, but she missed. Jenna did not. 
Glass smashed inside the house as Abbie touched the ball lightly. Probably a plate. The ball did not change its course. More yells from Mom. A door slammed. Louder yells. The ball’s rope was almost all the way around the pole in Jenna’s favor. Abbie leapt. She missed the ball, but got the rope. It wrapped painfully around her wrist, which was still sore from Devon’s Indian burn. 

“Fowl!” Jenna said. 

She took the ball from Abbie and drew it above her head with one hand. With the other, she hit the ball hard. It flew above Abbie’s head. Jenna squealed and did a dance, as the ball completed its final trip around the pole. 

“Best of three?” Abbie said, hopping to turn the tides and put her Adida’s to proper use. 

A loud bang from inside the house as a door hit a wall, followed by more yells on both sides. ‘It was Abbie though’ could be heard clearly from inside. Fast stomps and then the back door flew open, letting out a rush of cool air. Her mother’s face was red.

“Inside now!”

Her Adida’s had failed her and they were covered in dirt.

Gray roots contrasted her orange hair and the roughly painted pink blush made her look like she should be working in a cheap diner, not a hospital. The only thing that tied her to the hospital was her clean, freshly ironed, blue scrubs. She slid a clipboard with a pen attached by a metal beaded chain at me without looking up. I grabbed it with my freehand and pulled him to the desk. 

“Name?”

“I need to…”

“His name is Nick Crowley,” I said.

“Reason for your visit?” The receptionist asked like we were on vacation and checking into a damn hotel.

“I need to sit down!”

He pulled his wrist out of my loose grip and stumbled into the waiting area filled with cheap wooden chairs with pink leather cushions. An old man sat in the first chair against the wallpapered wall next to the water dispenser. Nick stumbled toward the man and looked like he intended to sit in his lap. With one cataract covered eye, the old man looked blankly forward and seemed oblivious to Nick’s clumsy and dangerous approach. I started after Nick, still holding the clipboard. He brushed the old man’s knee and fell into the chair to the left of him. 

“Have him fill out the highlighted parts. If you come back to me with his insurance card, I can get his information from you,” the receptionist said to my back.

Nick slid down the cracked leather cushion. He barely fit between the wooden arms. His hands covered his damp pale face. I lifted his head gently. His hands remained as if the air still possessed the weight of his raised head. Quickly, I placed the clipboard on his lap before the air returned to its normal weight. There were pink splotches in the shape of his hands on his cheek and forehead. I passed along the receptionists instructions. Eyes closed, he moaned quietly and nodded. A baby screamed a couple chairs over to our left as I stood up and headed back to the receptionist at the front desk. 

“Why is he here?” 

She still hadn’t looked up. 

“He fell and hit his head. Yesterday his neurologist told him…”

A loud moan that was unmistakably Nick’s overpowered my voice. I looked back and saw that he was still shuffling through the paperwork and looked unaware of the cry of discomfort that he had emitted. The receptionist finally looked up and presented me with a sympathetic smile that looked like it had been practiced in the mirror many times before. She would truly make a great waitress at I-hop. 

I went back to Nick and grabbed the clipboard. His head had returned to his hands.

1.Book- Second Hand Souls by Christopher Moore
-a. Charlie Asher- Protect his daughter
-b. Minty Fresh- Prevent the world from being taken over by the forces of darkness
2. Christopher Moore’s “Second Hand Souls,” is the second book of the Grimm Reaper series. The premise of the series is that Charlie Asher is turned into a Death Merchant by unknown forces. There are several Death Merchants within San Franscico and the rest of the world. The Death Merchants jobs are to collect and sell human souls.  When someone dies, their soul is transferred to an object, such as a book, which the Merchants collect. Charlie’s 5 year old daughter, Sophie, is the Big Death. In this book, he believes that she has lost her powers and that dark creatures are coming to get her. More than anything, Charlie wants to save his daughter. Other Death Merchants, like Minty Fresh, focus on the big picture and want to prevent the world from being taken over by darkness. 
3. 	Huan needed to find Charlie Asher, the Death Merchant. On her Father’s death bed, her he had given her the Chinese Book of the Dead and asked her do as the book required. Upon her first reading, it had required nothing over her. Based on her father’s request, that seemed wrong. She must have missed something. She read it again, but this time the words had changed. It explained the world of Death Merchants and the Big Death. On the last page, it told her that she had to go to San Francisco and deliver her father’s soul, which was trapped in his favorite robe, to the Death Merchant, Charlie Asher. 
	Two days later, she turned off the rental car and headed toward what looked like a military base at the foot of the Golden Gate Bridge, just like the book had said. Above the base, was a bright moving light. As she got closer, she realized that it was several lights, although they weren’t really lights. They were people, but not really. Maybe angels or ghost? They dove through the ceiling of the base. She hugged her father's red silky robe, which still smelled of him, and then followed the figures through the door. Inside the base, there were about 30 of the glowing figures. On a platform against the far wall, was a tall man in yellow holding a young girl’s hand. The figures circled around the man in yellow. 
	“Give me Sophie!” said a middle aged man with dark hair a few feet in front of her. 
	She looked around. There were two other men and a woman inside the sparse base. The man in yellow laughed and the glowing figures followed suite. 
	“Charlae?” she called out in a thick accent. She hoped one of the men responded. That did not sound like a very American name when she said it. 
	The man who had asked for Sophie glanced at her and then back at the man in yellow and the girl. Strong gust of wind seemed to emanate from the figures now. Lightning struck next to Charlie. She looked back at the door and thought about running. Getting in the car and driving back to airport. She could probably be back in China tomorrow. She looked at the robe and remembered her father’s dying wish. 
	“Di book told me to give to you my father soul,” she yelled even though Charlie appeared to be ignoring her. She wished she had payed better attention during English class.
	She shoved the robe into his hand. He grasped it reluctantly. The glowing figures disappeared and the wind stopped. The man in yellow screamed and she ran for the door, having fulfilled her father’s and the books wishes.

Green mangroves grow on either side of the kayak. They’re like furry green spiders emerging from the sea. Or maybe more like a giant octopus covered in algae. I kick my right flip flop off. The rubber shoe flies silently through the air and lands in the kayak with a hollow thump. The left flip flop follows and lands backward next to its mate.  The warm damp sand massages my feet. I sink my toes beneath its tan surface. It is like putting my toes in a bucket of ice that has just started to melt. I don’t move, but the sand seems to climb up my legs and attach itself to the white patches of sunscreen wrapped around the blond forest of hair.
	
A rhythmic caw of seagulls matches the light lapping of the waves. Their shadows glide over the water, which smells like dead fish and salt. The dull hum of a motor interrupts the birds’ song. They pause. The motor gets louder. Their song returns, but now it sounds like the high pitched cries of a nursey of babies. The cries get louder like they are trying to compete with the approaching boat; like how a baby would compete for the nurse’s attention. The kayak’s bobs intensify. The hum gets louder. Water splashes over the sides of the kayak, turning the paint a deeper shade of red. The tiny boat now bounces on the waves, which prevents more of the sea from joining my shoes in the kayak. My greasy fingers squeeze my nostrils. Gasoline seeps through them and mixes with the smell of the sunscreen. My nose burns as the chemicals speed to my brain. I feel slightly dizzy and the sun seems to brighten. It is almost blinding.  Blurry gray spots appear around the inlet. 

I focus on the kayak. It is no longer bouncing, but lightly bobbing. The waves are no longer trying to breech the kayak’s walls as it floats on the waves’ surface. I remove my fingers and take a deep breath. The salt stings slightly as it replaces the chemicals. I step toward the kayak. The sand crunches. The warm water engulfs my ankles and silents the sand. The lip of the kayak is surprisingly hot and the white insides of the fiberglass reflect the sun like a magnifying glass. I pull the sunglasses off my shirt neck and put them on. The spots return, but now instead of grey, the spots just slightly distort the inlet. One leg in the kayak, I push off. The kayak rushes forward and I quickly pull my other leg in and squat. My butt warms as it centers on the hard wood plank. I reach for the paddle and find none. My heart pounds. I take a deep breath that seems to come from my gut and turn my head. Leaning against a mangrove tree is the paddle. It waves goodbye as the kayak drifts farther out to sea.

I will return the favor.,"As you back out of the driveway, you pull slightly to the left to avoid the garbage can. Once on the street, you pull forward and roll down the windows. The dash reads that it is 70 degrees, but like typical Florida fall, you know that it will be in the mid-80’s before noon. Below the temperature, it shows that it is 8:45. You will have to hurry to get to work on time. A man jogging with his dog waves at you like he does every morning. You wave back. Palm trees litter the side of the road. You miss real trees. 
	

Cars speed past you on Lichen Avenue as you wait for your chance to join. You see a break in the traffic after a yellow truck. The truck passes and you gun it onto Lichen Avenue and fall in que behind it. There is a black car to your left. You wait patiently for him to pass and get over into the middle lane. Cars ahead are stopped at a red light. As you approach you slow down and eventually come to a stop as well. A billboard is off to the left in front of the Wawa. Morgan’s face, from Morgan and Morgan, is blown up and slightly pixelated with their mantra ‘For the people,’ covering his neck in huge white letters, followed by the unscrupulous attorney’s phone number. 

The light turns green. Without thinking, you follow the vehicle in front of you. All three lanes slow slightly as you round the curve. The left lane is going slightly faster, as it should be. You turn on your blinker and get over. Slowly, you speed past the cars in the right two lanes. You come to a safe 5mph above the speed limit. A red car with no blinker and a New York plate glides into your lane. You slam on your breaks, barely missing the rear of his car, and then you slam your fist on the horn, now going 15 below the speed limit. Angry cars behind you get in the middle lane and fly past you and the red car. You watch your rearview mirror and look for a break long enough for you to get over and accelerate without having to worry about being rear ended. Finally, there is a break. You turn on your blinker, make a quick head turn and get over. You accelerate and glance at the driver of the red car as you pass. He is an old man is sunglasses. Probably a snow bird. He stares straight ahead and doesn’t see your glare. You pass him and turn on your left blinker. Before you get over, you make sure there is two car lengths between you and him. He already almost hit you once. There is no need to risk him rear ending you. Chances are, his reflexes are no better than his vision. 

The light ahead turns red. You come to a stop at the thick white line. A motorcycle revs its engine to your right. The clock reads 8:58. Your fingers tap nervously at the steering wheel. You can see the office about a quarter mile up the road. The light turns green. You accelerate briefly and then turn your left blinker on and get into the turn lane. A police officer is steadily approaching. You dart in front of him and into the office parking lot. 9:00. You park in the first spot you see and leap out of the car, leaving the windows rolled down.

I pinched the shirt away from my back and pulled it to and from my damp skin like a fan. The heat and sun were turning my pale skin red. I raised the plastic blue bottle above my lips and to my forehead. The condensation mixed with my sweet. The overpriced beverage met my lips and slithered down my throat. Amber liquid dripped down into my beard.  I left it there. 
Below, the huge screen above the center of the stage flickered to life illuminating all beneath it. I jumped up with the rest of the crowed. Slightly smaller screens to the left and right of the stage also came to life. The screens glowed orange and red embers that increased intensity with the screams of the crowd. Spot lights shone down on the stage from all angles. The colors frantically switched between yellow, purple, red and orange. 
Most of the band were already in their places.  The guitarist adjusted his strap while the bassist strummed the air in front of the red bass. Center stage, sat the drummer, sticks raised. Trent Reznor ran on stage and picked up the microphone. He was tall with short, dark, graying hair. His skin looked free of tattoos around his black shirt and jeans. As he raised the microphone to his mouth, the speakers screeched. He looked above the stage to the right. The curtains flailed as the sound guys frantically made adjustments.  
	“Come on,” a middle aged man to my right in a faded black Nine Inch Nails shirt yelled and covered his ears. 
	I rubbed my right ear and covered the other. A young girl to my left was propelled into my arm. A little beer jumped out of the lip of the bottle and onto my shirt. I pushed her back lightly and wiped her sticky sweat from my arm. Her blond damp hair was pasted to her forehead as she jumped up and screamed. 
	The screeching stopped. My hands flew to the air. A scream forced its way up my throat and out into the arena. The drummer brought the sticks powerfully down to his drums and the other members of the band sprung into motion.
	“This is the first day of my last days,” Trent sang followed by a loud percussion of instruments.

When he got arrested he was on some bullshit and we broke up over that, but eventually started talking again months later, trying to rebuild our relationship. Everything was going good, I've been struggling and stressed trying to get everything ready for him, but I was excited to see him again.

He's moving in with me, which is something I've been nervous about, but had accepted with some conditions. One was that he would see a therapist when he got out, because it will be good for him, and he agreed. Now yesterday he said he's not gonna do it! He claims he said he'd come with me to see my therapist one time (""see a therapist"" doesn't usually mean a one time thing), but I know that's not what he said. He got very upset with me that I was pushing the issue and frankly that I expected anything at all from him. He said that he's gonna be too busy adjusting to life outside, finding a job, and ""doing all the things he needs to do"" and even twice a month is too much of a burden on him.

It's just bringing me back to before, when he was using drugs and saying everything he knew I wanted to hear in rehab, then immediately getting high when he left. I'm doubting everything he's said the past two+ years now. He kept calling me to say he loved me but he's not gonna just do what I want (like I'm demanding so much from him), then getting mad when I don't say I'm okay. He said this is the last thing he needs to deal with when the holidays are coming up and he's starting his program soon and I'm just stressing him out over nothing. 

But it's not nothing to me. I want him to have an established relationship with a therapist to help him if he's struggling, I don't want him to wait until he's already about to use to try and find help. I know he's gonna have stress readjusting, finding work, connecting with his daughter again, etc. And frankly, I don't have the emotional capacity to be his therapist, nor am I trained in that. I'm sacrificing A LOT to find a place for us by the time he gets out, and him not even being willing to try therapy seems like a punch in the face. I'm doubting if he's even with me because he loves me, or because he knows I'm dumb enough to believe his lies and support him until he can find someone better. I wrote him an email pleading with him to let me know if he isn't really in it for the long run, and that I'll still help him get on his feet, but I can't handle being played yet again by someone who claims to love me. 

He's upset that I don't trust him, and I said why should I considering everything he did before he got arrested, and he said he can't change what happened. Why would he think that I would blindly trust him again, just because he says he won't hurt me again? It makes me want to end things, or at least tell him he can't live with me until he proves he's serious, but it's so close to his release date I feel guilty doing that to him. Yet it's that same guilt that let him walk all over and destroy me before. I don't even know why I'm writing all this, I just don't have anyone to talk to about it and I feel like I've been punched in the gut.

My man gets out in April, so I need to have an apartment ready to go by then (I'm living with family now). I don't have issues renting on my own (besides finding a place that will allow my cat), but I've noticed that many places don't allow felons at all. I want to keep things on the up and up and let any future landlord know that he will be added to the lease when he gets out, because I don't want to risk being evicted if they find out I'm lying about him living there. But I'm starting to get pretty depressed about our options. I didnt even consider this issue until last week so it's got us both stressed now.

3054,yes,AskVet,2022-07-05 03:34:40,schmyndles,I'm just lost on what to do next for my cat's continuing skin problems,"Cat, DSH, male, 9 yo, 20.5 lbs, indoor only, no other pets, otherwise healthy other than this issue and weight.

TLDR; Do I need a new vet? Should I get a second opinion? Is it normal for a vet to be so dismissive with these things? He recently took over the animal hospital and the previous owners were very different and they were the only vet I've ever used. I don't want to be spending all this time and money on special food that won't help him lose weight either if allergies are most likely not the issue. I guess I just feel like I'm failing him trying to be his doctor via Google, but also don't want to spend time and money finding a new vet to just be given the same vague non-advice. He's also been going to this place since he was a kitten.

Okay, the skin issue: My cat has had dandruff, scaly flaking skin, hair coming out, scabs and wounds, etc, for the past 6 months. Took him in for his wellness check and shots March 3rd. I wanted to get him on a diet and discuss the skin stuff, but I think the vet was in a hurry to leave. I even showed up a half hour early when they asked. He barely touched my cat, ran his hand up his back and said he's not able to groom because of his weight, to brush him more and feed him less. Really no guidance on either issue. 

I've used sprays and waterless baths, various brushes and combs, and nothing helps. Called them back a month later to schedule another appt and instead the receptionist said they'll give me Revolution in case there's fleas (which he was given at the beginning of April, no change). She also recommended adding omega 3 supplement oil to his food, which I did for a couple months. She also suggested it could be a food allergy which would require a limited diet. So it took me a bit to research foods, but he's been on a no chicken, fish, or turkey diet for two weeks (I stopped the Omega oil because it had fish as well). I know that could take a couple months to show improvement though.

I feel weird doing all this really without any guidance. I am still limiting his portions and measuring all his food, but it's been hard because I have been switching his wet food trying to find the best ones and the kcal in each one is different, so he's lost about a half a lb since March. I continually check for flea evidence as well. I'm afraid that this is really bothering him or that he'll get an infection before he loses enough weight or I figure out if it's a food allergy. Not asking for a diagnosis, just want to know if I'm on the right path or if I should find a new vet to help.

I'm aware that these places do everything they can to misinform women and prevent them from obtaining abortions. The church mostly focuses on how it provides necessities for expecting and current parents and how it helps them find jobs and get benefits, which is great for people who have chosen to have their baby. But the website also talks a lot about ""abortion information and options"", then had a little disclaimer saying they do not perform or refer for abortions, which is misleading.

• Age: 8 years

• Sex/Neuter status: Male, neutered

• Breed: DSH

Body weight: 20 lbs

• History: Started approx two weeks ago, redness and fur missing from one ear, and had spread to both ears

• Clinical signs: redness, missing fur, scabbing, over grooming, overscratching, head shaking, black coffee grounds type dirt inside ear.

• Duration: two weeks

• Your general location: WI, USA

Hi, my car started showing all the signs of ear mites a couple weeks ago. At first I just thought he had accidentally scratched his ear, as only one ear was affected with redness. But last week both ears became affected, so I called the vet. They walked me through a list of symptoms to check for, and that's when I noticed the black dirt in his ears. He already has a wellness check (vaccines and a talk about his weight) scheduled for March 3rd, so the doctor said I could wait until then for treatment of the mites.

But I can tell he's miserable, and I want to make him at least comfortable until he can get in, so I called them back the next day (Thursday) and asked if there was anything else I could do. I'm already on the cancellation list, but she recommended getting some cat ear cleaner and using a cotton ball to try and clean them out.

So yesterday I went to the pet supply store and grabbed some car ear wipes, and I noticed they had ear mites drops for cats as well. I grabbed those too, would it be okay for me to try those? Idk if they would kill all the mites, but at least it might provide some relief for the next couple weeks? It's called Four Paws Aloe Ear Mite Treatment for Cats. It has pyrethrins (.05%) and piperonyl butoxide (.5%).

I just don't want to screw up any treatment the vet may have for him, or give him something that's dangerous. I know he's not officially diagnosed with mites, but the doctor and I both think that's the issue.

I don't know if I should go in there and confront her, out text her and tell her I see her in the bar and she needs to come home, but I know she'll just ignore me like she always does anyways. I just need to rant I guess, I'm so pissed right now.

I recently found a therapist and have my next appt Tuesday, so I'll be able to process this more and work on boundaries. Which I already know I'm very bad at. But I've already decided that I'm not babysitting anymore, even if she sends my nephew to guilt me into saying yes, I need to stand firm on this. 

She came home after 11pm, and hasn't said a word to me all day. She probably won't. I've been making myself scarce though, and her not talking to me is the norm. I went in the bar for lunch, and got to hear from the owner (aka our landlord) how she was there making out with this guy for hours, and they went to the back room and were all over each other, and it was really awkward for everyone else.

3063,yes,Effexor,2021-11-14 18:46:57,schmyndles,Effexor causing false positives on UDS drug tests for PCP.,"Idr if I've posted this before, but it's been a couple years so figured I'd do a lil PSA quick.

I'm a recovering drug addict, have been for years. I saw an addictionologist who prescribed me medication assisted treatment (MAT) to help me stay sober, and I had to get drug tested monthly. At one point, my PCP started me on Effexor as my Paxil wasn't as helpful.

My addiction doctor was informed of every medication I was on. But within a few months of starting Effexor XR (225 mg), I tested positive for PCP (aka Angel dust). He said none of my other meds would cause a false positive for it. I had never even seen PCP, let alone used it in my life, so I was pretty upset, and he finally said it could be the test. He did send out my sample for further testing and it was proven to be a false positive.

About a year later, again I tested positive for PCP. Again, it was sent out and shown to be false. I did some research and found that people on Effexor have tested positive before, even though they've never used PCP, so I told my doctor I believed that was why. He said I was wrong and I ended up switching to another facility because of other things he had said and done also, but this was one of the main reasons.

I just wanted to share this for anyone on Effexor who is drug tested. It can cause false positives for PCP. Most people probably don't have to deal with tests that look for that, it's not usually tested for like for jobs and what not, but as depression and anxiety are pretty common in addicts, it's something to keep in mind.",9,23,23,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='qtwfal')>,,/r/Effexor/comments/qtwfal/effexor_causing_false_positives_on_uds_drug_tests/,False
3064,yes,dechonkers,2021-10-11 10:07:36,schmyndles,Wobble ball cat toy that looks like a mouse,"Edit2: u/Tesdinic [found it!](https://www.reddit.com/r/dechonkers/comments/q5smib/wobble_ball_cat_toy_that_looks_like_a_mouse/hg95afs?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) I'm leaving the post up though because there are so many great toy suggestions in the comments. Thank you everyone, and happy dechonking! 

I had gone to a local pet shop earlier this year, and they gave me a little goody bag with like food and treat samples, and this wobble ball mouse toy.

My chonker loves this toy, and he is not a toy cat. He will actually run around the kitchen, stalking and attacking it. Unfortunately, he chewed the face off of it, and it's no longer interesting to him, so I went looking for a new one.

The shop I got it from said they think the maker isn't making them anymore. I've checked every pet shop I know of, pet sections of every store, Amazon, Google, Etsy, etc...I cannot find this toy anywhere!

Does anyone know what I'm talking about, or where I can get a new one? I've found other wobble ball toys, but none that look like realistic mice, and he isn't interested in the other ones I give him. It's so hard to get him to exercise as it is, we're leash training but all he wants to do is lay in the grass or go ham on the catnip behind the house, so finding a toy that he loved was a godsend!

Edit: I should've included pics before. It's not a feeder toy, just something to bat around. Here's the current one (warning: the face was chewed off so it looks very weird).

3067,yes,idiopathichypersomnia,2021-09-08 02:25:26,schmyndles,Just need to vent,"I've been wanting to try some of the newer meds that have come out, as after ten years on the max dose of Adderall I'm back to barely functional. My primary Dr, who prescribes my meds, referred me to their sleep specialist because she didn't feel comfortable as she wasn't well versed in those meds. 

So I see this guy for the first time last week. He was in the room a total of two minutes (after making me wait a half hour while he ran across the street for coffee after my appt time, as I was in the waiting room, checked in, and watched him leave). He didn't pull my chart up, didn't even sit down, didn't look at me at all. He said ""so your don't have any medical conditions and aren't in any medications?"" Yeah, if he actually had glanced at my chart he'd see the laundry list. He didn't even know I was on Adderall or that I was diagnosed with IH. He immediately asked if I'd gained weight recently, and I said truthfully that actually I've lost weight.  Butt he interrupted me to say I need a PSG, because it's probably sleep apnea. I said I've had a PSG, and an MSLT, and I've used CPAP just in case it would help, and nothing shows sleep apnea. Again, interrupted. ""Well, I'm going to schedule you for a PSG and we will find the cause of your sleepiness"". Then he was gone.

I couldn't even process what happened, I just sat there in a daze as the nurse came in to tell me they've already scheduled my next appt (for a day and time where I'm at work), and that the sleep clinic will call me soon to schedule. I can't imagine how stressful that would've been for someone who didn't even know what a PSG was! 

I'm so pissed off, I'm already dealing with shit from this new HR guy who has decided he knows what my FMLA parameters are better than me or my doctor, my doctor is currently on maternity leave so I can't talk to her right now, and I just want to hit my head against a wall as that would be more productive than this doctor appt!

I'm all about thinking horses before zebras, and if it was apneas and ask I needed was a CPAP I would cry from joy at having a solution, but I know, it's been proven, that sleep apnea is not my problem. 

This HR guy actually tried to write me up because I want calling in before my (5am) shift started, and even my boss said that I can't call in if I'm unconscious and that's unfair to put that on me. For three years my FMLA has covered up to 6 shifts a month, either the full day, or by the hour. It says from 1-24 hours on the paperwork. But now this guy who had been there a couple months, just out of college, and claims he's a ""professional"" when it comes to FMLA, and all the other HR people just couldn't do their job, says that whether I'm a minute late or miss the whole day, it counts as a full shift towards my monthly allowed time. I refused to sign the write-ups (there were two, for the late call-ins, and for ""going over"" my allowed FMLA for the month). I called in 4 shifts, and was late the times, totalling 5 hours. My shifts are ten hours, so that's 4 1/2 shifts, out of 6. But he now says each day counts as a shift, so I'm at 7 which is one over. And I guess he has no records from before he started, and he admitted that the last person never gave me the summary of what was allowed (it's nowhere in my record), yet still expects me to sign it? I can't even see how many hours I've missed before April when he started he said, so I can't prove that I've done this before and never had an issue. 

I just had to vent, I'm sorry. I have so much going on, and this looming threat of losing my job and insurance is making everything worse, and I literally have no one to turn to to help me.",10,11,11,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='pk1lff')>,,/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/pk1lff/just_need_to_vent/,False

3098,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-05-20 20:42:51,Missleaded_,"How do you deal with boundaries and being perceived as ""difficult"" when you set them?","Hi! I'm new here, and I found this Reddit a very safe place to explore my diagnosis.

I'm a high-capacity autistic adult and I tend to be perceived as a Neurotypical person since it is not evident that I'm autistic. This is hurtful but I understand that is not their fault not knowing how diverse the spectrum is, so I brush it off quickly and change the topic. 

Lately, I started to explore all the situations that trigger my crisis, and most of them, maybe 90% of the time, are triggered by people overstepping my boundaries. For example, making decisions without my consent about something that involves me or talking about their implications beforehand, making a change of plans without asking how that affects me or my schedule. This is very frequent and kind of difficult to deal with since I don't feel safe disclosing my diagnosis to everyone, but it's really something that brings out the worst feeling I have ever experienced.

I don't want to go and say ""Please don't do this because I'm autistic"" since people always find it difficult to deal with me when I share that I feel disrespected or start gaslighting me into being convinced it's my fault. How do you deal with this kind of experience?

To give you some context, I'm supposed to attend a concert with friends, but they decided to upgrade all the tickets (three, mine included) to a more crowded location without even asking for my opinion. I'm sure I would have told them that I was ok with it since at least it would have given me a heads-up beforehand, however, I realized that just when I received an email with the info. When I told them how disrespectful it was to do it without even asking, they told me I was making a fuss out of it and started to receive very harsh messages from them, saying ""ok, you're angry, good for you :)"" ""you can go alone, I down-graded your ticket"". I went through a huge meltdown after that.",8,20,20,0.96,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13n837f')>,,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/13n837f/how_do_you_deal_with_boundaries_and_being/,False
3099,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-05-20 20:17:03,AutisticIntrovert383,College/university is not built for us.,"I know this has been discussed before on this subreddit and the r/autism subreddit.

I attend a college which is on a quarter system and the classes last 10 weeks. This is 10 weeks of extremely fast-paced instruction and learning. The quarter system runs from September to June and consists of a fall quarter, winter quarter, and spring quarter. The quarter system lasts for 10 weeks. The college/university expects all students (regardless of neurotype) to adjust to the quarter system in 2.5 months. At my college/university orientation, the advisor said, “In our eyes, you all are adults now. You don’t have to ask to use the restroom…” This is ableist. We autistics do not mature at the same speed as NTs. Mentally, I still feel like a 13-year-old.

If I could go back in time, I would take a year off before starting college/university, as this would mentally prepare me for the rigors of college/university and the quarter system (10-week classes). In this way, I would be prepared and be able to adjust quickly.

The classes that I am taking this quarter are Maths 2D (Multivariable Calculus I) and Physics 7D/Physics 7LD (same class) (Electricity and Magnetism). My major is Computer Engineering. Despite one of my special interests being electricity (plugs and voltages), I cannot focus in my Physics 7D lecture class and discussion class. I am in week 8 out of 10 in my third quarter. I am almost done with my first year of college/university.

This is my third quarter. My first and second quarters were extremely challenging (new environment, new quarter system). I have still not adjusted to the quarter system. Hopefully, by September (start of second year), I will be adjusted.

When I started college/university in September 2022, we (students) are expected to figure out college/university on our own without any help. We (students) are thrust into an entirely new system and expected to figure it out with little to no help.

For us autistics, the adjustment period is closer to 1-2 years due to the sudden change in the pace of learning and instruction (10-week classes), workload (vague lectures and homework instructions) and the frequency of exams. All this causes an increased risk of a meltdown. I hope that I will be adjusted to the quarter system by September 2023. This was my first time attending onsite (in-person) classes after 2.5 years of online classes due to COVID-19.

In my EECS (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) classes, the professors explain the lectures in a vague/unclear manner, and they assume that we have already learned the subject before the quarter. They expect us to be “mature adult engineering students”. The professors don’t explain homework assignments. The professors explain the instructions in an unclear way and expect us (students) to figure the assignment out on our own. My professors always say, “You’re an adult. Figure it out. I’m not responsible for helping you with the assignment.”

Thankfully, my Maths 2D and Physics 7D/7LD professors are clear and direct. The questions on the quizzes and exams come from the textbook and homework problems.

Now, even though COVID-19 is still a pandemic, the professors have gone “back to normal” in their lecturing style. This means no online classes and no recorded lectures. My professors are not obligated to record the lectures. However, my accommodations state that I can record the lectures. Since I have slow handwriting, I take pictures of the lesson material. My professors have no problem with this.

As a result of autistic inertia, my mom has to sit next to me when I do my homework. Otherwise, if that doesn’t happen, no work gets done and I start going on other websites. Website blockers and timers do not work.

My accommodations in college/university are:

1. 2x extra time on quizzes/tests/exams
2. Recorded lectures (I can audio record the lectures and discussion sessions.)
3. Access to scratch paper (lined paper) on quizzes/tests/exams
4. Quizzes/tests/exams in a separate location (DSC\*)

3100,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-04-28 01:58:47,AutisticIntrovert383,I successfully presented about Autism Acceptance at a Neurodiversity Support Group (NSG) meeting at my college/university!,"On April 17th, 2023, at 17:14 (5:14pm), I presented about Autism Acceptance at a Neurodiversity Support Group (NSG) meeting! I am very proud of myself! It almost felt like lifting the World Cup trophy! :)

I attended a neurodiversity meeting to interact with other neurodivergent students at my college/university. This group/club supports ND students, and raises awareness and acceptance of neurodiversity. This group has a goal of establishing a peer mentoring program.

This meeting had an informal meet and greet, some presentations, and a discussion about a potential Disability Cultural Center (DCC).

I was planning to present about Autism Acceptance from Saturday, April 15th. I made the slideshow, and I shared it with the leader of the group. I chose to present first.

When I presented about Autism Acceptance, I was wearing a double face mask and a necklace air purifier to protect myself from COVID-19. There were 2 other students, the leader, and an IT (Information Technology) person to help with the equipment. We were all sitting socially distanced (2m/6ft apart).

Even though I was the only one wearing a double face mask, everyone understood me.

After my presentation, we discussed about Autism Acceptance, and I said, ""I started interacting with the autistic community on 29th May 2022. (I alternate the date formats between month-day-year and day-month-year.) After my high school graduation on 24th May 2022, at 21:00 (9pm), I started ruminating through the interactions that I had with the other students, and I found no connection. This caused me to think ‘Why am I unable to socialize with other kids in school?’ On May 28th, 2022, I started browsing on Autism Forums. However, my mom saw me browsing and said, 'What is this autism discussion?'. As soon as she said that I pressed Control+Shift+N and opened a new private browsing window. Every time I interact with the autistic community, as soon as my mom says, 'What are you reading/watching?', I change the screen. We autistics need clear and direct communication. We do not need to be forced to learn indirect and vague communication."" 

Everyone agreed with me. This was the first time that I was able to interact with other neurodivergent students onsite (in-person). I started interacting with the autistic community online on May 29th, 2022 at 15:55 (3:55pm). It was a 323-day wait for this moment.

I was always thinking, ""When will I be able to interact with other NDs in-person?"" First, I found Autscape ([http://autscape.org](http://autscape.org)) which is a 4-day event held in the UK every year in July or August. I showed the website to my mom, and she told me, ""It’s in a different country."" I told her, ""It’s a 2 hours and 31 minutes drive from London.” She told me, ""You must be kidding me. It looks like a trap.""

Then, she found this group. She told me, ""Look at this. There is a neurodiversity group. The leader of the meeting is also an autistic person"". Then I told her, ""I will attend the next meeting (Tuesday, February 21st)."" However, on the next day at 15:00 (3pm), I had a midterm in my Maths 2B (Calculus II) class in college/university. So, I didn’t attend.

On Friday, April 14th, I saw a message that someone had sent (I’m not saying their name due to privacy reasons). The message was about a presentation on ADHD. After I saw that message, I got inspired to make a presentation about Autism Acceptance. For 2 days, I made the presentation. On Monday, I arrived to the meeting at 17:08 (5:08pm). Six minutes later, at 17:14 (5:14pm), I started my introduction and presentation about Autism Acceptance. I finished my presentation at 17:24 (5:24pm). This was the first time that I was able to interact with other NDs in person after 323 days!

After the meeting, I had this conversation with the leader of the group from 18:21 to 18:38 (6:21pm to 6:38pm) (conversation in bold text):

**L: How did you find out about us?**

**Me: My mom showed me about this group. First, I found Autscape, which is a 4-day event held in the UK every year in July or August. I showed the website to my mom, and she told me, “It’s in a different country.” I told her, “It’s a 2 hours and 31 minutes drive, and 142 miles from London.” She told me, “You must be kidding me. It looks like a trap.”**

**Me: I have no relatives in the UK and we don’t know anything about that country.**

**L: That’s good. It’s not safe. What if you get trapped?**

**Me: Yes, it’s not safe. It’s fine for locals but not for foreigners.**

**Me: On 24th May 2022, I attended my high school graduation ceremony. Since I was scared about getting COVID-19, I wore a double face mask and a necklace air purifier. I tried my best to maintain 2m/6ft of social distancing. However, on that same day, at 21:00 (9pm), I started ruminating through the interactions with the other students, and I found no connection. This caused me to think, ""Why am I unable to socialize with other kids in school?"" On May 28th, 2022, I started browsing on Autism Forums. However, my mom saw me browsing and said, ""What is this autism discussion?"". As soon as she said that I pressed Control/Command+Shift+N and opened a new private browsing window.**

**Me: I have known that I am autistic since I was in 7th grade (2017). However, I had built an NT mask as my parents told me ""Try to mask your autism"". I did not understand what that meant, and they told me that masking means hiding. This caused internalized ableism in me. I always used to think ""Why am I autistic?"", ""Why do I have autism?"", ""I want to be normal"". I hated the words ""disability"" and ""disabled"". This continued all the way until high school. On March 13th, 2020, my high school shut down due to COVID-19, and I was relieved of the pressure of bullying and passing as NT. I spent the next 2 years in online classes. I was able to work with no distractions and no pressure of bullying and passing as NT.** 

**Me: Every time I interact with the autistic community online, as soon as my mom says, ""What are you reading/watching?"", I change the screen. Thankfully I don’t have to change the screen here.**

**L: That’s fine.**

**Me: My mom and dad are thinking of traveling to India this summer. However, I interact with the autistic community online from 06:00 to 23:00 (6am to 11pm) Los Angeles time (UTC-7 in summer). I am worried that I will have to play the game of ""Change the screen"" if my cousins see me interacting on autistic community subreddits and forums. I don't want my cousins to know that I interact with the autistic community online. Therefore, I will have to do a night shift from 18:30 to 11:30 next day (6:30pm to 11:30am next day) IST (India Standard Time is UTC+5:30). Autism awareness in India is low.**

**Me: I joined Autism Forums on 29th May 2022 at 15:55 (3:55pm) this time (Los Angeles time). This would correspond to 30th May 2022 at 04:25 (4:25am) IST.**

**L: That makes sense. So you’re saying that you have to change the tab every time someone walks by?**

**Me: Yes.**

**Me: Are you also autistic?**

**L: Yes.**

**Me: I have been interacting with the autistic community online since 29th May 2022, at 15:55 (3:55pm). It is a relief to find other autistic people. Everyone understands me. It had been a 323-day wait for this moment!**

**L: That’s great to hear.**

**Me: I have disclosed my autism to my professors and TAs last quarter. I am very proud of myself and I want to be openly autistic.**

**L: I’m very proud of you for doing this.**

**Me: Self-advocacy is very important.**

**L: That’s true.**

**Me: See you at the next meeting (May 15th).**

**L: See you then.**

When the conversation ended at 18:38 (6:38pm), I declared myself as a champion! I had the courage and bravery to present about Autism Acceptance during Autism Acceptance Month! :)

My major is Computer Engineering. However, I am on a quarter system (10 week classes). This is my third quarter. My third quarter starts on Monday, April 3rd.

Before my classes start every quarter, I send an email to introduce myself to my professors and TAs (teaching assistants). I do this to remind them that I have DSC* accommodations (template in bold text). 

**Template for introducing myself to professors and TAs:**

**Hi Professor [name] and [TA name],**

**I am excited to be taking [name of course] with you this quarter. Math and physics were my favorite subjects in high school. I hope that you have received my DSC accommodation letters for this quarter.**

**Here are some things that you might want to know about me before the quarter:**

**Sometimes, I do not make direct eye contact. Please do not assume that I am rude/not listening to you. I show that I am listening during the lectures by taking pictures of the lesson material and audio recording the lectures.**

**I get distracted very easily and I am nearsighted (I have poor eyesight). Therefore, I will be sitting in the front of class. Since I get distracted very easily, I will be looking around the room often.**

**Looking forward to seeing you on the first day of class.**

I successfully disclosed my autism to my professors and TAs on the first day of my second quarter. They were supportive and proud of me. I was and still am proud of myself for being brave and courageous enough to make such a big decision. :)

As a result of successfully disclosing my autism to my professors and TAs in my second quarter, I have decided to disclose my autism in my introductory email before my third quarter starts. 

**I am letting you know that I am an autistic person. Therefore, I am clear, direct, and literal when speaking. Please take this into consideration when interacting with me. I do not have any friends in any of my classes as it is very hard for me to make friends. In my experience, interacting with my professors/TAs is easier than interacting with my other classmates.

Should I disclose my autism to my professors and TAs before my classes start, or should I wait until the first day of class?

3103,yes,AutisticAdults,2023-03-19 16:52:01,AutisticIntrovert383,Date formats around the world,"There are 3 different types of date formats used around the world: month-day-year (MM/DD/YYYY), day-month-year (DD/MM/YYYY), and year-month-day (YYYY-MM-DD). The US uses the month-day-year date format, which is not used by any other country. The rest of the world uses day-month-year, and Asia uses year-month-day. 

Canada is the only country to use all three date formats which can cause confusion as the official languages of Canada are English and French. Canada is influenced by US, UK, and French culture, so using all three formats can confuse anyone. Canada uses MM/DD/YYYY in English as it is influenced by the US (biggest trading partner). As French is the official language of the state of Québec, it uses DD/MM/YYYY. This is why the Canadian government recommends YYYY-MM-DD as it removes all confusion and is understood by anyone regardless of language barriers. 

For example, today’s date (March 19th, 2023) would be written as “03/19/2023” in the US, “19/03/2023” in the UK, Europe, and the rest of the world, and “2023-03-19” in East Asia. This can cause confusion around the world as when the month and day numbers are below 12, there is a 36% chance of confusion. When the month and day are the same, or the day number is above 12, there is no confusion. 

What happens if you have a date such as “04/01/2023”? I would say “April 1st, 2023”, and you would say “4th January 2023”. A date such as “2023-04-01” is interpreted as “2023 April 1” which is understood worldwide.

Type A is used in the US, Mexico, Canada, Japan, and Taiwan. Type B is used in the US, Mexico, Canada, and Taiwan. Type C is used in Europe except the UK and Ireland. Type D is used in India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. Type E is used in France, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Poland. Type F is used in Germany, Austria, Spain, Portugal, Russia, and the rest of Europe except the UK and Ireland. Type G is used in the UK, Ireland, Singapore, Malta, Hong Kong, and Malaysia. Type H is only used in Israel, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and Palestine. Type I is used in Argentina, Australia, China, Fiji, and New Zealand. Type J is used in Switzerland and Lichtenstein. Type K is used in Denmark and Greenland. Type L is used in Italy, Chile, and Urugay. Type M is used in South Africa and sometimes in India. Type N is used in Brazil and sometimes in South Africa. Type O is only used in Thailand. 

220-240V is more dangerous than 100-127V. Most of the world uses 220-240V at 50Hz or 60Hz; countries that use 100V to 127V are greatly outnumbered. Europe uses 220-240V at 50Hz, and North America uses 100-127V at 60Hz. Japan is the only country in the world that uses 100V and two different frequencies: 50Hz in the east and 60Hz in the west. Brazil is the only country in the world that uses 127V and 220V at 60Hz; however, only one type of socket (Type N) is used. Some countries, like Taiwan, use 110V and 60Hz, and China uses 220V and 50Hz. South Korea and the Philippines use 220V at 60Hz.
 
Appliances rated for 100-127V will be destroyed when plugged into a 220-240V socket with an adapter. Appliances rated for 220-240V will simply not work when plugged into a 100-127V socket. Phone and laptop chargers will work on any voltage ranging from 100-240V and 50-60Hz. When 60Hz appliances are plugged into a 50Hz socket, often with a step-down transformer, the 60Hz appliance will run 16% slower and overheat as a result of the lower frequency. However, 50Hz appliances will work when plugged into a 60Hz supply as the appliance will run 20% faster and cooler as a result of the higher frequency. Any appliance with a clock or timer will run slower or faster depending on the mains frequency (50 or 60Hz).

Type A is used in the US, Mexico, Canada, Japan, and Taiwan. Type B is used in the US, Mexico, Canada, and Taiwan. Type C is used in Europe except the UK and Ireland. Type D is used in India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. Type E is used in France, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Poland. Type F is used in Germany, Austria, Spain, Portugal, Russia, and the rest of Europe except the UK and Ireland. Type G is used in the UK, Ireland, Singapore, Malta, Hong Kong, and Malaysia. Type H is only used in Israel, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and Palestine. Type I is used in Argentina, Australia, China, Fiji, and New Zealand. Type J is used in Switzerland and Lichtenstein. Type K is used in Denmark and Greenland. Type L is used in Italy, Chile, and Urugay. Type M is used in South Africa and sometimes in India. Type N is used in Brazil and sometimes in South Africa. Type O is only used in Thailand. 

220-240V is more dangerous than 100-127V. Most of the world uses 220-240V at 50Hz or 60Hz; countries that use 100V to 127V are greatly outnumbered. Europe uses 220-240V at 50Hz, and North America uses 100-127V at 60Hz. Japan is the only country in the world that uses 100V and two different frequencies: 50Hz in the east and 60Hz in the west. Brazil is the only country in the world that uses 127V and 220V at 60Hz; however, only one type of socket (Type N) is used. Some countries, like Taiwan, use 110V and 60Hz, and China uses 220V and 50Hz. South Korea and the Philippines use 220V at 60Hz.
 
Appliances rated for 100-127V will be destroyed when plugged into a 220-240V socket with an adapter. Appliances rated for 220-240V will simply not work when plugged into a 100-127V socket. Phone and laptop chargers will work on any voltage ranging from 100-240V and 50-60Hz. When 60Hz appliances are plugged into a 50Hz socket, often with a step-down transformer, the 60Hz appliance will run 16% slower and overheat as a result of the lower frequency. However, 50Hz appliances will work when plugged into a 60Hz supply as the appliance will run 20% faster and cooler as a result of the higher frequency. Any appliance with a clock or timer will run slower or faster depending on the mains frequency (50 or 60Hz).

However, I had built an NT mask as my parents told me “Try to mask your autism”. I did not understand what that meant and they told me that masking means hiding. This caused internalized ableism in me. I always used to think “Why am I different?” I want to be normal”, without realizing the consequences of passing as NT. This continued all the way until high school. On March 13th, 2020, my high school shut down due to COVID-19, and I was relieved of the pressure of bullying and passing as NT. 

In May 2022, I started reading about autism and the autistic community. I learned all the terminology and I joined Autism Forums. This is an internet forum for interacting with other autistic people. Now I do not go on Autism Forums. Please see (1) at the bottom of this post. 

I started understanding myself and accepting myself for who I actually am instead of “faking” myself towards NT standards. I like to interact with other autistic people here in this subreddit and the #ActuallyAutistic community on Twitter and other social media sites. In my opinion, having conversations with other autistic people is better for me than interacting with NTs. 

Does anyone else relate? How long have you known that you are autistic?

(1): I believe that some internet forums are unsafe. Some forums, especially for teenagers (whether autistic or NT), can be filled with pedophiles who are looking to lure young teens into harmful situations by posing and tricking them. This subreddit is also a forum, but it is for us autistic adults. So, there are less chances of pedophiles.

I'm now freaking out inside","I DO have diagnosed anxiety after going thru some traumatic events past decade (childs death, 1 very abusive relationship but that was awhile ago, seeing the SO being ran over by a truck). Been struggling with a lot recently. Was recently switched to prozac and was also given a short term prescription for xanax to calm the nerves (I seem to wake up everyday with what feels like a very physical/in my tummy dread and terror). I'm in therapy, etc. In therapy it was suggested adhd could explain racing thoughts and such, so I went in for assessment. This was just an intro appt. There are further appointments (haven't even filled out the questionnaire she gave me yet) so no diagnosis has come... however... 

After some initial questions during the hour, she said it's more likely I'm on the autism spectrum (or both? But she seemed to lean towards 'not adhd and defo on the spectrum).

She cited eye contact - which I don't have a problem with I just often look away when in thinking mode.
She cited my hand position.
She cited my withdrawness (xanax? I've been sad lately?)
She cited my self admitted engineering brain (I'm a systems engineer) and my capacity to research something till I'm blue in the face.

Adhd made sense to me. Autism does not. My heart dropped when I heard it, and I don't know what to make of it or how to process it, especially while I await further assessment.

No one else in the family has had such a thing.

How have I gotten thru years of therapy or a year with a psychiatrist with no one ever implying anything remotely close to it?

How do I tell my SO? She's going to treat me differently from this point on.

I've seen severe autism. I've also seen mild/high functioning (work with some) and I don't see myself at all.

I've been reading for a few hours now and about the only thing I can see a correlation with is emotional sensitivity.

I don't fear change. I crave it. I love meeting new people. Zero problems sparking up conversation with strangers (or at least it feels like it? )

I don't think I have ocd style repetitive habits or routines.

Sure I have a small social circle but I'm also a solo expat and almost all expats have a similar complaint. Support is hard to come by

Yet that's certainly different today! English is a living language, and words -- and their meanings -- evolve over time. This may be an example.

In addition to AuDHD, I also have OCD and *maybe* BPD. I'm in different subs for both of those illnesses, know people with those illnesses, follow other people on social media with those illnesses, and so on and so forth -- and I've picked up a common trend:

A general frustration with how ""neurodivergent"" has largely become synonymous with ""autistic / ADHD,"" and how autistic and ADHD people have effectively made ""neurotypical"" to mean ""allistic"" (i.e., not autistic) and / or ""doesn't have ADHD.""

Obviously this isn't our *intention*. I've seen lots of people, when the subjects are brought up, point out that things like depression, GAD, etc, are also neurodivergent.

Unfortunately, though, just because something isn't intending to be harmful doesn't mean that it isn't. Our continuous equation of ""neurotypical = this person who doesn't have autism"" is inevitably accusing a **whole** lot of people of being neurotypical when they aren't whatsoever.

Another issue I've seen related to our overuse is that I've actually seen a *lot* of autistic people be confused over why they don't find it easier to get along with ""neurodivergent"" people when they're referencing experiences with allistic individuals. 

The reason is that the studies they're thinking of note that we have an easier time of getting along with **other autistic people**, not neurodivergent people.

(That also isn't a given. Just as allistic people don't get along with all other allistic people, autistic people don't get along with all other autistic people.)

""Neurodivergency"" covers a wide array of diagnoses. It's depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, C-/PTSD, narcissistic personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, OCD -- it's literally every single mental illness known to humanity, right along with developmental disorders that affect the brain's pathways, and so on and so forth.

Someone who is diagnosed with PTSD (for example) is not going to get your behaviors and mindsets that ultimately stem from your autism. They *might* even be dicks about it.

That doesn't mean they're neurotypical -- it means they're allistic.

TL;DR: I'm a chronic overthinker. I'm not asking to be diagnosed or even necessarily what anyone here thinks I am or am not -- I'm asking how you realized you have BPD, especially if you suspected (or knew) before diagnosis.

I met a friend of mine about three years ago, and when he told me that he had BPD, I started doing research on it. That research led me to the realization that *another* friend of mine most definitely has it (not diagnosed, at least not yet, but if you meet all criteria, ya know).

Having a (disorganized attachment)[https://www.healthline.com/health/parenting/disorganized-attachment], there are naturally elements to BPD that I can understand and apply to my own life.

More and more recently though, and especially when I hear people talk about their experiences with quiet BPD, I find myself relating to very nearly everything.

Which, ya know, makes a person wonder. I went through this same thing when I first wondered if I had autism, and then again when I wondered about OCD.

For the past several months, I've (29yo, Nonbinary (they/she), Pansexual being) been actively learning about autism because I've been suspecting that I may be autistic. My partner was the one who initially brought it up in conversation. It made me think to look into it, and it's  really quite undeniable now: I'm confident that I'm autistic/have autism. 

I'm not interested in self-diagnosing, but everything I've been learning about autism up to this point has just clicked with who I am and how I grew up. I've always been ""different"" from others, no matter how hard I tried to fit in with them. I'm actually awaiting an autism assessment/evaluation, that I'll be beginning in a few weeks. I would like to know more about who I am, and a diagnosis would help me with that journey. I want to be taken seriously and seek out the resources that I may need without shame. 

However, I know that these assessments/evaluations are typically catered to children, are based on medical-models, and don't  guarantee support (or much of it). As an adult who suspects that they are autistic/has autism, receiving a diagnosis is difficult. I'm all too aware of that. 

BUT HERE'S THE REAL KICKER (and the reason for my question): I spent some time with my mom this morning. We had some coffee and went on a nice walk at a local park. While at the park, my mom and I start talking about disabilities, and how my brother might be disabled. That's when I decided to finally tell my mom what's been going on (the above thing I said, autism, blah blah blah). And here's what she told me: that she can believe that I am/have it because of the way I was as a child and teen, and that my pediatrician, who asked my mom if I had ever been beaten due to me being terrified and hiding every time I had an appointment (never beaten btw), suggested that I be assessed for autism and my mom just didn't think she should do it.

3143,yes,DebateAVegan,2023-05-22 07:41:32,Kleecarim,"Questions from a vegetarian trying to turn vegan (Not trying to debate veganism in general, only specific details)","Thank you for all the positive responses. I appreciate it 

Hi, I've been eating vegetarian for half a year, and the more I think about it, the more I realize that vegetarianism is not as ethical as I would like it to be. Currently, I am researching veganism more and more, and while I agree that vegetarianism is probably not much more ethical than eating meat (if not even worse arguably), I have some questions about specific details. Please understand that I am trying to argue in good faith, and that I am really concerned about the ethics behind my decisions, and not trying to question veganism in general.

My questions are:

1. I have family friends that keep chickens as pets. While I know that they do in fact slaughter some of them (even though I know they don't slaughter all of them, don't ask me about the reasons for this, it confuses me, too), they keep them in good conditions where they have lots of space to roam freely. They don't charge us money for the eggs, and I know that us consuming those eggs does not motivate them to keep more chickens to slaughter later. Would it be unethical to consume those eggs? If yes, why? (I can imagine multiple reasons, but I am not entirely sure what conclusion would be justified).

~~Relevant to this question: Close to where I live, there is a farmer who keeps cows in relatively ""good"" conditions, but he does, in fact, slaughter them, and I assume that rape is happening to them, too. Could it be argued that consuming this milk is ethical? (I tend to say no, but I could provide arguments for why I think that could be the case)~~

Upon reflecting on this further, I see how stupid it would be to claim that supporting these conditions could be ethical, so just ignore it.

2) As someone who is struggling with my mental health (and currently trying to recover from addiction), I am living with my parents, and I do not have the energy to cook for myself every day. While my parents respect my decision to not eat meat and even started to eat less meat/cook vegetarian dishes more often to allow me to continue eating with them, I know that they would likely not do the same if I decided to eat vegan, at least not to the same extend. Even though this does not change the ethics of my behavior, what can I do in this situation? Would you argue that I have the responsibility to cook for myself? (note that a lot of the time, when I can, I already do, but some days I barely have the energy to brush my teeth)

3) Lastly, a general question not necessarily related to my situation: Do you think consuming certain animal products can be ethical in certain situations? For example, what could be said against keeping e.g. chickens as pets and eating their eggs (especially unfertilized ones)? If you argue that eating eggs is unethical in every situation, does that relate to your stance to abortion (if yes, how)? Note that I am not trying to suggest that abortion is unethical (I am pro choice for what it matters), I am simply trying to understand if a relation between those two topics exists.

The more academically (philosophically) backed your answer is, the more I would appreciate it, but I am happy about any input.

And lastly, not necessarily a debate question, but do you have any advice that could make it easier for me to live vegan? I should probably add that I already struggle with eating a lot of the time, lost about 15 kg of weight in the last year, and I am definitely somewhat malnourished (or at least have nutrient deficiencies according to a recent blood test). I know that this is likely not a good defense for not being vegan, but it definitely is making the transition even harder.

I  was diagnosed about half a year ago, after being told multiple times  that I probably am on the spectrum but my symptoms probably won't be  enough to qualify for a diagnosis. When I went to get diagnosed, the  test results (multiple computer tests, some questionnaires my parents  had to fill out, multiple for me and some other tests I don't know how  to describe that dealt with reading facial expressions) basically barely  scratched the mark to be enough for a diagnosis (I am talking if the  required ""points"" were e.g. 30, I scored 31). The person that tested me  basically asked me if I wanted to have the diagnosis or not (maybe she  asked if I accept it, and she asks everyone, but I don't believe that  tbh).

This makes it very hard for  me to feel valid, as every time I mention to someone that I am autistic I  feel like I have to add that I am not ""that"" autistic because I fear  that I invalidate other people's struggles since I probably often pass  as NT. I have a hard time in social situations, but on the other hand  there are lots of symptoms I don't experience, or at least not in the  severity many other autistic people do. For example, I don't think I  ever had a meltdown, the closest thing I experienced to that is getting  overwhelmed a lot when there are too many noises around me, but usually I  can still function. I also struggle in social situations, especially  when it's with people I want to get to know better, but smalltalk and  other meaningless interactions (e.g. with cashiers) work just fine for  me, and I don't think people notice I am ""different"" in those settings.  Plus, I feel like a lot of the ""symptoms"" I experience became more  severe in the last 2-3 years, when I started questioning whether or not I  am autistic, so I am not sure if I am subconsciously amplifying them.

Another thing on my mind is the worry that those symptoms are caused by my diagnosed adhd.

I  don't really know what my aim with that post is, maybe I want to hear  that I am valid from other people (probably not just maybe), maybe I  just want to know if people can relate, or maybe I just want to know if  other autistic people are okay with me claiming to be autistic even  though I don't suffer from it as much.

I am not a philosophy student and even though I am very interested in it, my exposure to it was quite limited. I learned a bit from Zizeks Videos/films, read Descartes Meditations 1 and 2 and did some research about the general history of philosophy and logic (mainly fallacies) but overall I definitely am a layman.

I was always interested in Marx's Capital, and finally got around to reading it. However, I am afraid that due to my limited exposure to literature like this and philosophy in general, I might not be critical enough towards his ideas, take things he talks about in his book at face value and develop ""wrong"" beliefs. 

My question is: What are some things I should keep in mind when reading Marx?  What are some critics I should read after finishing the book, and is there any research I should do before reading it to understand it better? And would it be possible for you to give me a broad understanding about if/which ones of his ideas are generally seen as outdated or simply ""wrong"" in philosophical circles?

To clarify, this question is not about *how* I should read philosophical literature (like how to take notes) but specifically what would be important for me to not misunderstand Marx. 

On a sidenote, I'd really appreciate it if you wouldn't tell me to read other authors except if it is necesarry to understand marx (I do not want to give the impression that I think I 'know better', I simply always was and still am very interested in his ideas and want to learn more about them)

TL;DR: What do I have to read/know to read marx without ""brainlessly agreeing"" with his ideas and developing unreasonable beliefs?",49,25,25,0.86,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='z9nhfr')>,,/r/askphilosophy/comments/z9nhfr/i_am_currently_reading_karl_marxs_das_kapital/,False

I have been getting crashes everytime I tried to launch the game through the launcher. I tried deleting the config files, reinstalling multiple times, deleting every mod but nothing besides launching the gamefile with admin permissions works.

Saldy this prevents me from using mods as I cannot decide which ones I want to load with this method. I tried using vortex but for some reason, harmony doesnt work with it so its not an option either.

Does anyone of you know a fix for this?

I will probably be using a cyma 040 series as a base gun (I wouldnt know of any better options since I will change most of the internals/externals anyways) and am currently looking for affordable zenit replica parts, specifically:

* a b30/31 railed handguard([original](https://en.zenitco.ru/catalog/weapon-upgrade/handguards/b-30-rail/))
* a b33 dust cover([original](https://en.zenitco.ru/catalog/weapon-upgrade/rails-above-the-reciever/b-33-rail/))
* a pt1/pt3(s) stock ([original](https://en.zenitco.ru/catalog/weapon-upgrade/stocks/-pt-3s-telescopic-stock/))
* an rk4l grip ([original](https://en.zenitco.ru/catalog/weapon-upgrade/grips/rk-4l-grip/))

My budget is around 500 bucks but I'd like to upgrade the internals a bit, too (at least new barrel, nub and bucking). The base gun and some other basic attachments like an optic will probably be around 200 - 250 bucks, so that would leave me with around 100  - 200 bucks for externals.

Do you know any manifacturers that sell those parts at an affordable price? I know big dragon makes them but they are still expensive (200+ for a b30/31 and a pt1 clone), so I want to make sure their quality is good firtst. Realsteel parts are not an option either since any of those parts costs more than what I am planning to spend on the whole gun

Thank you

Btw, if anyone of you already built a zenit ak from a cm040, please let me know what parts you used and what problems you ran into, this would help me a lot.

Let me present you the stages of my brain

State 0 - initialisation: The fsm (my brain) calls the GetRandomIdea Method from the Ideas.js lib. From here, the fsm can switch to the following states: 1, 2, or 3

State 1 - procrastination: the fsm is trying to do a task but since the developers were too lazy to research asynchronous programming it freezes because it is waiting for the ""Dopamine"" API to send a response, therefore blocking the entire process. Sometimes the api returns the wrong data, leading to the FSM executing stage 2 with the wrong parameters (e.g. the object ""Reddit"" instead of ""Working""). Upon getting the data (which can take hours or, in the worst case, not happen at all), it can switch to state 2 or 3

State 2 - hyperfocusing: for some reason the devs implemented async in this function, but they didnt  implement it properly and instead executed every statement in its own thread. This leads to the fsm overloading slowly and while it seems to be working at fits, it starts to spit out random data from the Database because it got distracted. From here, the only possible state change is to state 4

State 3 - existential dread: At this point, the finite state machine has become self aware and realised its codebase is a pile of garbage, but since it does not have write privileges on the code, it cannot do anything about it and gets hung up on a while(true) loop that just calls the feelGuilty() function. Luckily, it can still go to stage 4 at this point to escape this endless loop

State 4 - overload: due to the devs not caring about ram usage and running the project on a commodore 64, the processor starts overheating and the device running the fsm initiates an emergency shutdown. Usually it takes around 1h and up to a few days to get it running again.

Oh, and there is also State 5 - productivity, but whenever the function to initialise this state is called a ""not implemented"" exception is thrown

Either I am onto something or I completely lost my mind now lol

Anyways, got to go, I'm off to write an A(DHD)PI

3167,yes,mongodb,2021-10-28 09:46:25,Kleecarim,"MongoDB noob here, Database modeling question","Hello,

I am currently writing a database with a collection called Order. It contains a reference to a company the product was ordered from, a reference to the user who ordered it and an array of references to the products that were ordered, along with some other data (price, timestamp etc.)

The idea is that a company will be able to see the open orders in the webinterface I am building for them, but since there will probably a lot of orders I am not sure if I saving the order in a table is the most efficient way.

Should I 

a) save all the orders in their own collection and just query the ones with the company ID reference (what I am doing right now)

b) save all the orders in an array inside the company document or

c) create an array that contains order references inside the company document ? If I do this, should I delete the reference to the company document in my order document or leave it there to create some kind of two way reference?

I apologise if those questions are too trivial, I am new to mongoDB and its hard for me to get out of the ""SQL only way of thinking""",8,5,5,0.86,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='qhje4o')>,,/r/mongodb/comments/qhje4o/mongodb_noob_here_database_modeling_question/,False
3168,yes,Angular2,2021-10-27 09:43:05,Kleecarim,"trying to build an order page, what would be the best way to implement it?","I am trying to build an order page in angular that displays a list of products I request from my server. currently I am displaying all the items in seperate material cards. Now I am trying to add a +/- button and save the items inside a collection (probably array).

My question is: What would be the best way to implement this? Should I use a reactive form, or would this be overkill? Or should I just add a function binded to my button that adds my current item to an array?

My compotent.html file:

    <div>
        <mat-card *ngFor=""let d of dishes"" style=""margin: 3em"">
            <mat-card-title>{{d.name}}</mat-card-title>
            <mat-card-subtitle>{{d.description}}</mat-card-subtitle>
            <mat-card-subtitle>{{d.price}}€</mat-card-subtitle>
        </mat-card>
    </div>

If I added a button that calls a function which takes a dish (product) as a parameter and then adds it to an array, how would I be able to display how many products of this kind are selected (so it looks like this: \[minusbutton\] \[amountSelectedItems\] \[plusButton\]) ? Is there a better way to do this other than adding an amount property to my Dish interface or iterating through my array and count the objects?

Sorry if those questions are too basic, I know how to implement it but I don't know if there is a better solution for this",5,4,4,0.83,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='qgsx9p')>,,/r/Angular2/comments/qgsx9p/trying_to_build_an_order_page_what_would_be_the/,False
3169,yes,webdev,2021-10-21 11:29:14,Kleecarim,NodeJS - Socket.io questions,"Hello,

I am currently building a project in nodejs with an angular application as a frontend. I need to send data from my website to the server (POST reqeust) which then emtis data to one of many raspberry PIs and gives feedback to my angular app per websocket connection.

I have a few questions on how to do this whole process:

  
1) I have an index.js file where I load all my express middleware etc, and some router files for specific routes. The websocket connection should be initialised outside the router so I dont open a new one every time. Should I create an on connection listener in the index.js file and outsource all the emits to a different file, or should the whole socket server live inside a different file?

2) I know that socketio needs an http server to work, but I cannot pass an exress server in its constructor. Should I use an http server for my server instead and use express as a request handler? Or should I create a new http server for my websocket connection?

3) Should I create a different socket server for the server/angular and raspberry/server communication (I will need to store the socketID and token/id of the raspberry in a map to know which raspberry I should send the data to) or should I use the same server with different rooms?

I apologise if those questions are too basic, I have never really worked with websockets so I dont know about the best practices when working with them.

I am currently writing a project with a singleton service that handles my auth requests and saves the auth status and userdata (isLoggedIn, name and a boolean to indicate a special role).  My service works just fine when I call it in the navbar to display the username and hide the login/regitser buttons. Whenever I call it in my guard though it returns undefined. Earlier this week I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Angular2/comments/qalyfe/angular_injected_service_is_undefined/) post but none of the solutions helped me.

The even weirder thing is that once my guard calls the service, the entire service is undefined, meaning that the navbar also does not display the username anymore.

So far I have tried:

1. Initialising the service before the guard
2. adding the HttpClient in the AppInitializer object dependencies in my app.modules providers\[\] array
3. Changin the singleton service to be provided by the app module and removing the providedIn root

I probably tried other fixes, too, but those are the ones I remember trying for sure.

What I can say for sure about this bug:

1. the service is initialised when the app loads, the guard is initialised when it is called.
2. both service and guard exist as a singleton, there arent multiple instances of any of them
3. the services htp calls works
4. other components can access the services data, only the authGuard behaves in a weird way

3172,yes,u_Kleecarim,2021-10-20 13:07:01,Kleecarim,When (and how) to sell your crypro - a guide,"With  the market going crazy again during the last few weeks, many coins  reached new all time highs or  at least recovered from their downtrend.  Now is a great time to take profits, but selling can be even harder than  buying for a lot of people. Thats why I wanted to make a post telling  you all what my strategy is and how you can avoid making some mistakes.

Obviously,  I am not a financial advisor (duh) and everything I say should be taken  with a grain of salt. I am just sharing what I believe is a good  strategy to take profits while minimizing risks and maximising gains.  The numbers I will present are not set in stone and might not fit for  you. On a sidenote, English isn't my first language and I am typing this  on my phone, so I apologize for any typos and grammatical mistakes

Anyways, let me introduce you to my selling strategy

# DCA in, DCA out

Almost  everyone here agrees with one thing: DCA is the way. But DCA isn't only  an amazing buying strategy, it is also appliable when you are selling  your assets. Never sell your crypto at once, spread your sells over a  certain time. You do not want to try ti time the market, you most likely  won't beat the odds. Rather than trying to sell at the top, spread your  sells over a set timeframe. Your favorite altcoin reached new ATHs?  Sell it over the period of two weeks, you are more likely to make higher  gains that way than if you sold everything at once.

# never sell everything

I  had to learn this the hard way. I got some doge as a joke when it was  at a bit less than 1cent. When it went to 5c I sold it because I made  some nice gains. If I had decided to let even just 10% in, I would have  more  than doubled my gains.

Don't  get me wrong, taking profits is never a bad idea, but if you leave a  small portion in you can't miss out on any future upside potential. If  it goes to zero, well, sucks, but you still made some nice gains. If it  shoots up, you make even more profits

# set sell orders

We've  all been there: you made some amazing gains and tell yourself ""I'll  just let it ride one more day. It might go up, right? I could miss out  on even more gains!"". Then, the crash comes and you yell at yourself for  not taking any profits to take advantage of that yummy dip. Thats why  you set sell orders. I usually set one for 2x, 3, and 5x, with some more  at higher price points, and I try to get my initial investment out at  3x. Usually, I always sell 20% of my coins at each price point, with  slightly more at 3x than at 2x. After that, I still have some great  exposure to the coin but I got my initial investment out.

# put some of your profits aside to buy dips and pay taxes

I  can't emphasize this enough, don't go out and instantly spend all of  your profits just because you made some money. A lambo is nice but going  to prison because you can't pay for taxes is not. Oh, and definitely  set money aside to buy the dip. Instead of spending that few hundred  bucks you made with SafeDogelonMoonMarsCoinMuskTokenScam for coke and  hookers, reinvest it and possibly be set for life if you repeat the  process for a few times

# never use the same strategy for multiple coins

If  you are dealing with low cap coins, you should be more careful than  with OG ones like ETH/BTC. I never took any significant profits from btc  or eth because I believe in them long term and see a lot of potential  in them, I usually even reinvest profits from other coins into eth/btc.  But with smaller cap coins I am way more careful, and the riskier my  inveatments are, the more profits I take. Always  change your strategy  to fit your investment, and of course your risk tolerance, too.

I  hope I could help you and/or teach you a few new things. Stay safe and  may your portfolios reward you for holding all those shitcoins you are  too ashamed to talk about",0,1,1,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='qc0fwn')>,,/r/u_Kleecarim/comments/qc0fwn/when_and_how_to_sell_your_crypro_a_guide/,True

I am currently building an application similar to an online shop. I have a user, who is always a customer but can also be a seller (flag isSeller: boolean), and every seller has one (or multiple) companies. Every companies has to have a seller. Every product has one company, a company can have multiple ones. I also have orders, which have a buyer, a company and a product.

I already have a collection users, but I cant decide if I should store sellers as an additional collection, if I should add the flag isSeller to my user and add a reference to user in the company collection (the SQL way) or if I should add an array to users that contains the company IDs. 

My other problem is that I don't know how I should implement the Order table, I know how to do it in any SQL database but I have no idea if there is a better way to do that in mongo

For the company table I will use an array with objectIDs of products, since I heard this is the best way to implement it in mongo

1. user triggers the reset password request
2. the server generates a key and sends them an email with a link containing this key
3. when the user clicks on the link the server checks the key
4. if the key is valid, the user gets redirected to a certain page to change their password
5. the server checks if the change password request came from an authorized source and changes the password

For example, while VeChains Proof of authority is far from perfect, at least in terms of decentralisation, it is still from perfect (last time I checked they had somewhat around 100 nodes), it is still 100 times better than having a centralised company with no blockchain at all. I totally agree, decentralisation is important, and it should be the number 1 priority, but we tend to forget that even some of the most centralised projects are way more decentralised than literally every tech giants servers, but we still use their centralised services while shitting on projects with way more decentralisation and call them centralised.

Disclaimer: I am mainly comparing ADA to ETH in this post, and I do not prefer one coin over the other. While I will try to be as objective as possible, for transparency reasons I want you to know that I hold both of them in my personal Portfolio

Let me now list all the arguments people use against Cardano

""ADA doesn't have a working product""

Actually, this isn't correct. First of all, they already have a working POS system, which can't be said about ETH. ADA already has a lot of strategic partnerships, for example the Ethiopian government, which is planning to use a licenced copy of the blockchain to store its students data. 

""ADA has been in development for years!""

Yes, but so does any other crypto, ethereum is still in development, too. This is what makes it great. A working product is a less risky investment, but it also leads to less potential growth. IOHK is developing cardano slowly because they want to get it right and are backing it with research This approach is, in my opinion, the best possible one, as it should eliminate potential fatal errors before a full rollout. 

""ADA is only big because Charles is manipulating its community!""

Charles is engaging with its community all the time, thats right. But he isn't shilling ada. Everything he says is backed by facts, the only thing he is doing is keeping the community updated on the project and providing transparency in the development process. In stark contrast to a lot of other crypto devs, which usually have limited community engagement, Charles is keeping the ADA community up to date, and I am thankful for that 

""ADA will never kill ETH""

It doesn't have to. Multiple PoS chains can coexist, that's the point of decentralisation. Not being forced to use a certain service by a certain company. Charles himself never said that ADA is an eth killer, quite the opposite, he thinks ADA and ETH can co-exist

I am really excited about the future of cardano because I think it is an amazing project with lots of potential. I will keep loading my bags with ada because I believe in it's team and technology

>I've got an idea, and I'm wondering if it's been discussed/ripped apart here yet:

>I'm wondering if as bitcoins become more widely distributed, whether a transition from a proof of work based system to a proof of stake one might happen.  What I mean by proof of stake is that instead of your ""vote"" on the accepted transaction history being weighted by the share of computing resources you bring to the network, it's weighted by the number of bitcoins you can prove you own, using your private keys.

>For those that don't want to be actively verifying transactions, and so that not all private keys need to be facing the network, votes could be delegated to other addresses via some kind of nonstandard Bitcoin transaction.  In this way, voting power would accumulate with trusted delegates instead of miners.  New bitcoins and transaction fees could be randomly and periodically distributed to delgates, weighted by the number of votes they've accumulated, thereby incentivising diversity of the delegates and direct voters.

>If the implementation could be done, it proved to maintain at least a similar level of privacy and trustworthiness, and it only minimally complicated the UX, I'm thinking that a proof of stake based fork could out-compete a proof of work one due to much lower transaction fees, since its network wouldn't need to support the cost of the miners' computing resources.  (Note that the vote delegation scheme has bandwith/storage overhead that would offset these savings by some amount which would hopefully be relatively small.)

>Some other potential improvements this system could offer:
Possibly quicker, more definite confirmation of transactions, depending on how it can be implemented.
The ""voting power"" may be more trustworty, since it would accumulate in a bottom-up fashion via a network of trust, instead of in the somewhat arbitrary way it accumulates now.  (Note the potential problem of vote-buying here.)
It would remove the physical point of failure of bitcoin mining equipment, which can be confiscated or made illegal to run.
It could be used to provide stakeholders a means of making their voices heard (via the delegated voting system it establishes) when it comes to proposals for software updates and protocol changes.

>Anyway, I just wanted to throw the idea out here to see if there are any obvious reasons why it couldn't be implemented, and to hopefully spark a discussion amongst those better qualified than me.

But especially in first word countries, people tend to forget how important taxes can be to our society. Free healthcare (sorry fellow americans), streets, schools, you get the point.

So, let's imagine crypto takes over the place of fiat. This would obviously be a great thing for all of on this sub and arguably for the whole world, too. Banks getting replaced by smart contracts, way less centralisation and all the other great stuff ctypto provides us with. But people tend to forget that governments will still be a thing, and they will still rely on tax money to provide us with all of the public services we enjoy today. Their solution to this will most likely be to either ban crypto as a whole (I know, LOL) or release their own, centralized blockchains to be able to tax us correctly. 

So now you understand the problem. Lets think about how we can solve this.

One possible solution would be for the government to force blockchains to implement different lables for transactions. What I mean by this is that every transaction would have to be labled in a way so the government can tax certain transactions from certain wallets. The problems with this solution are obvious: it would be relatively easy to manipulate, even if companies would be forced to label wage payments and sales.

Another possible solution would be if the government would be entitles to a certain amount of gas fees, but this would be hard to realise for multiple governments on a global scale, and would also make transactions way more expensive

After all, I think this problem will either lead to a complete reform of governance systems, or the more likely situation of Gouvernements releasing their own blockchain they cab controll, which would destroy the whole concept of crypto.

3) mistakes I make now will not impact me in a way they might if I had more money on the line. I will be able to learn from them and do better once I finished college and get a job

4) the profits are even more amazing for me than for many others. A lot of people here see crypto as a way to retire early, but I just want to be able to afford a car or some other nice stuff. All it takes for me is a bit if luck and patience. I already made some nice gains during this year and if I wait a bit longer, I might be able to cash a part of the money out and buy myself something nice

So if you are like me and feel bad about not having a lot of money on the line, don't! Enjoy it. There are a lot of advantages for you

Only negative aspect is that I don't have any money lying around to buy the dips",16,10,10,0.92,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='n4fcky')>,,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n4fcky/until_recently_i_thought_being_a_student_and/,False

I feel like most people (especially newbies) on this sub are like me, and constantly check their portfolio 24/7. The first thing we do after waking up is checking out exchange, then we spend hours a day researching and thinking about all the amazing project out there. While this doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing, I am sure a lot of people get too sucked up and are really emotional about their investments.

We all want to make gains, but constantly checking won't help, it will only lead to stress. Cryptos are amazing and its easy to get sucked up in this huge new world full of promising technology, but we all have to think about our mental health, too

So what I want to say is relax, take a step back and hodl for the long term. Day trading will most likely be less efficient for you anyways, so why bother checking the charts every few minutes? Just buy crypto and stay informed, but don't forget about all of your other hobbies. Do things that make you happy and see crypto as what is: an investment, not a hobby.

My sister is 14 and gives me money to pay a netflix account for her with my card (she gives me cash, I pay online) because our parents are pretty much control freaks who monitor exactly what and for how long we (especially she) watched on our shared account. When we both still used the shared family netflix account my parents would take it away for almost anything, even watching too much a day in the holidays lol, which pretty much pissed me and my sister off. 

So, she decided she wanted to pay her own account. I didn't contribute to it with my money because my parents now don't control me as much as they used to, but they still do that with my sister, so I started using my card to pay it.

Now, fast forward a few months, to today. My parents have access to my bank account because that's their condition for me getting pocket money. Well, they found out that I am paying for my own account, and after telling me to cancel it because ""they didn't want to pay for it twice"" and me ignoring it they went to my bank account and took almost 70 bucks (the money I spent on Netflix during the last 5 months). I sure as hell was super mad at them but they just laughed it off and told me that since its their money (my pocket money) they can basically do whatever the fuck they want

I had a job during the summer so that's bullshit, and I would say less than half of my money comes from them but they won't listen to me. I didn't tell them my sister was paying for it and using it because they would have just punished us both instead of just me.
I told my parents that I would remove their access to my account but they told me if I did that I wouldn't recieve any more money from them, and I need their money since I don't have time to work during school months

To be fair, I have my own set of trauma that has made vulnerability difficult for me. I am working on that with many different modalities. 
I noticed men do not seek healing. Many women I know are unhappy with their boyfriends. Tolerate many things. 

I also noticed men have placeholder girlfriends. Recently, I saw a neuroscientist say men will not go after the woman they find most attractive because they either do not feel worthy of her or the have a subconscious belief she will be too difficult to keep/ please.

There seem to be so many circumstances that are out of my control. Plus, it seems both genders are becoming increasingly open to playing games and treating things transactionally.

I want to find the sweet, goofy guy in middle school or high-school who used to have a mad crush on us. Does that make sense?

We’re constantly fighting from deficits and make the most careless turnovers throughout games in key moments. 

No discipline in this team. No fire from the coach, just watches Durant get tripped in front of him and stands there arms folded. Then compounds his stupidity by playing the guys until 4 minutes left while book is obviously hurting and Durant plays *the whole first half*

Wish monty wasn’t such a good guy so we’d actually look at someone else when this season is over. Everyone just points to “remember where we were without monty” when looking in the past but the current and the future will continue to look like this if we don’t look for a coach with an actual plan and fire that monty lacks.

“Mental fortitude”

“Wd>Ws”

“My ceiling is your floor”

Like wtf man, stop with these feel good phrases that mean absolutely nothing when you’re running the same play over and over and running your stars into the ground.

Meanwhile nuggets get whatever they want and blow us out if their shots are falling or barely lose when our stars are going nuts and hitting difficult shots… one is sustainable the other is just bad coaching.

It appears in my frustration I overlooked obvious things he’s improved on. Still, there are certain elements of the game that he NEEDS to improve if he wants to take the next step. He improved on strengths, now it’s time to improve on weaknesses (boxing out, contesting shots, catching passes, sealing his man, dribbling, etc)**

Mikal is better off the dribble and midrange

Cam J is improved as a shooter and in ball handling situations

Cam Payne has learned to slow down and be a facilitator

Booker has given max effort on D and cut down his turnovers 

That leaves the last of the young guys…Ayton. He’s the same player he’s been. I thought we were gonna get some better ball handling according to him? Or better at drawing fouls?

He still fumbles a bunch of passes, can’t dribble, can’t back down anyone, and settles for the premeditated moves he’s made his mind up on before catching the ball. 

How hard is it to back down Bobby Portis? How hard is it to not attempt rebounds by soft tapping it to yourself and just grab it? Or to box your man out? 

Call this a hate post after dropping 30 but genuinely curious where his improvement this year has come. His numbers offensively are slightly better with slightly more fga but other than that, has he improved at all?

3376,yes,suns,2021-04-18 22:58:08,TheLostKee,Player-by-player improvements this year and what they can work on,"Thinking of all our guys improvements from, say, the bubble to now, not including the new additions. Just to see the internal effect of natural progression. Also to see where they can improve to get better individually. This ain’t a hate post, or a love gush post, just trying to be as objective as I can as a viewer.


**Ayton:** 

*Improvements*

better team defense as our anchor, better decision making offensively by not making the same pre-determined moves all the time and passing out of obvious advantageous situations, more focused throughout the game, some gains in the hands/catching department, and a bit better at keeping the ball high as to not let guys strip him.

*Weakenesses*

Would want to see more hands/catching development, keeping the ball up consistently, attacking the rim with aggressiveness on plays that call for it (the biggest one for me right now) aka dunk the easy layups that are 70% makes into 90+% tone-setting dunks.



**Book**

*Improvements* 

Much better individual defender (fights through most picks now), marginally better team defender, slightly more efficient overall (fg% and turnovers)

*Weakenesses*

Would want to see continued increase at the ft line, and to sharpen his handles up as I think it’s the weakest part of his game. I honestly think the defensive leap is big, but offensively book has struggled to play within the system and find his rhythm in the natural flow. 



**Mikal**

*Improvements* 

Much more consistent with his shooting form, continuing improvement with off ball movement, slight improvements with his dribbling to certain spots to get his own shot.

*Weakenesses*

Would want to see more consistency. He gets lost it seems in some games where if he doesn’t get off to a decent start it’s hard to expect him to figure it out as the game goes on.. like a “either he’s got it or not” mode offensively, also continue improving his handle to create on his own, and lastly to gain strength to handle bigger players on both ends. Sometimes he’s easy to get off his spot since he’s so thin. 



**Cam J:**

*Improvements* 

Much more comfortable putting the ball on the floor, improved mid range game, confidence with shooting his shot even when he’s missing (which sometimes I wish he’d chill with), underrated as a passer in DHO with Ayton 

*Weakenesses*

Would want to see a bit more restraint on quick threes, especially when cold, more consistency overall with his shot, and just natural progression to getting stronger and better with the skills he’s working on. I actually think if his handle improves he can be a tertiary ball handler in certain sets. 



**Cam P**

*Improvements* 

Confidence is at an all time high, handles the ball well, can get his shot most of the time, when he’s locked in he can be a pest defensively.

*Weakenesses*

Would want to see more pg ability, sometimes he’s trying too hard to get his own shot. He has no right hand whatsoever, would like to see him work on it, or at least stop with the drive right finish left takes that get blocked half the time. 



**Jevon**

*Improvements* 

His shot is back, when he stays in his role he can be really good for us, his usual defense is pretty solid most of the time.

*Weakenesses*

Would want to see more focus on being a true defensive stopper when he’s in (at least against the backup guards), seems like he’s been a bit more focused on the offensive end lately. Would like his handle to improve, but not a big deal if he stays within himself and realizes he’s more a catch and shoot sg than an initiator. 



**Dario**

*Improvements* 

When he’s on, we’re hard to beat. His shot is better, he can run the offense a bit from the top or the block. 

*Weakenesses*

Would want to see better finishing around the rim. He’s so unathletic that sometimes what should be a mismatch isn’t bc he gets no air off the ground. 



**Frank**

Just get healthy from covid and maybe he can contribute once in a while when Dario is fucking up. 



Our guys have improved a ton, and it’s annoying to see “cp made the Suns” headlines weekly. I actually think Booker has improved the least of any of our guys. Might be bc he’s already really good and his improvements are marginal,
But beyond his on-ball defense, I think he really needs to fix his ball handling and decision making. It will hurt us bad in the playoffs when he mishandles his dribble, regains it, wastes 5 seconds with jab steps that go nowhere, then force up a bad shot, claim he got fouled, and complain to refs.

3384,yes,suns,2020-12-20 01:10:17,TheLostKee,Am I crazy or could this be a potential way to run our offense primarily? (CP3 more off-ball),"I feel like part of the reason Paul was so successful in Oklahoma City was because Alexander was able to handle the ball a lot offensively. This is pretty evident by Paul averaging a career-low in assists last year. 

This took the pressure off of Chris Paul to have to run the offense 24/7 like he’s used to in his career. I’m not sure if he has the youth to be able to carry in that way anymore, but it seems like Booker is ready for that role this year. 

It’s like having points Booker of a few years ago, except the secondary ball handler is a Hall of Famer that can still do it in spurts, but not the primary focus of the offense. 

Also seemed like our offense has looked the best when Booker has it in his hands. When Paul has it, sometimes people are just standing around waiting for him to create a look.

Honestly, I think that’s been a knock on Paul’s career, that he creates a sort of ceiling for your team when he’s the primary focus of the offense. In LA he was great and so were they, but you could tell that team was begging for Blake griffin to put them over the top, and it never fully happened. 




**Tldr:** Book should be our primary ball handler, with Paul playing the off-ball secondary and situational play-maker. 


Side note: I’ll get shit for this but it’s not shade bc Paul is a guaranteed HOF’er, but I think it’s the same as when we had Nash and Amare and Nash was our best player. We just had a slightly lower ceiling bc we needed Amare to be our best player and he never fully got there (except his was bc of injury imo).",8,9,9,0.8,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='kgkhuy')>,,/r/suns/comments/kgkhuy/am_i_crazy_or_could_this_be_a_potential_way_to/,False

**Starters:**


CP 28 mpg

Book 35 mpg

Ayton 33 mpg 


**Bench**


Payne 12 mpg

Carter 12 mpg 

Moore 11 mpg

Smith 

Alexander 


I didn’t assign minutes to the guys who probably won’t be in the regular rotation, but those minutes add up to the 240 minutes in a game (48 x 5).

Now I think a great thing would be to stagger CP and Book’s minutes so we have at least one on the court for most of the game. 

Maybe CP’s break comes early in the game, 5 minutes in, and bring in carter to play the off guard spot while book plays point. Then at around the 2 minute mark, bring CP back for book. This can also be done with aytons minutes as well, to line him up with as much CP time as possible. 

I think the main point I’m trying to make is that I’m super excited to see CP lead certain units without Book on the court. Surround him with shooters/defenders/ayton, and let him pick the D apart.

CP

Carter

Mikal

High scoring basketball does that. But there needs to be better balance. It’s becoming like a video game, with video game numbers being put up. It’s literally not even cool to score 30 anymore, and 40 is like “oh nice, how many fts he get?” Anyone can do it. 

The refs have difficult jobs, we all know that. But this is a problem beyond them. Silver needs to drive a point home that I’m not sure he wants to. I’m sure seeing 132-128 games looks awesome on paper, but I can’t help but feel like it’s all inflated stats. 

I also get the natural progression of the game. Everyone is shooting 3s, at a higher clip, ft shooting is up, ball movement is better, players individually are more skilled. But that’s exactly the problem: let those natural talents speak for themselves. Give defenses a chance to compete. Stop bailing out offensive players with ridiculous foul calls over and over and over. A few things can easily happen and be implemented by the start of any season as soon as next:

1. Reinstate, revise, and actually ENFORCE the flopping penalties. Make players pay, literally and figuratively for flopping. It’s ugly to watch, the refs can’t catch it real time, and potential for injuries is higher. Review potential flops at halftime and assess a technical foul, fine the guy 50k, and after 5 flops he’s suspended a game. It’s getting ridiculous to watch players flail and whine and then on replay you see it’s all fake. (Jaylen brown tonight when horford grabbed him).

2. Create a rule for the unnatural offensive move-there’s a difference between having a defender on your hip, and maneuvering him and controlling him based on that advantage, and coming around a screen only to jump sideways or sometimes even fucking backwards into a defender who is recovering. That’s not fucking basketball. Dame does this all the time and for a while they were calling it on the ground which is at least better than what it is now...3 shots for setting a pick at the top 35 feet from the basket. It’s really stupid that it forces either the big man defender to come all the way to the top to meet him which allows for an easy blow by. There’s very little chance for the D to do anything, especially with the Chris Paul’s and dame lilliards baiting refs with these flopping shots. It’s not fun to watch, it’s not fair, and in the spirit of the game, it doesn’t make sense to shoot sideways jumpers just to draw fouls. A rule should be made that only shooting motions going directly towards the basket or straight up can result in a foul, unless it is the type of foul that the defenders feet slide underneath the shooter (like on a fade-away). Penalize the offensive player with an offensive foul on these ridiculous attempts. Dame damn near got his team to the playoffs by doing this (yes I’m a salty suns fan who watched dame get 7 fts in a quarter off of 3 pt attempts...the point stands)

These are subtle changes that would make it SO much more watchable and make it more fun to watch again. Defenses have no chance and I’d rather watch 105-110 basketball that gives D’s a chance than 135-130 games where the whole quarter is based on gaming the refs and defenders playing scared defense in fear of giving up a cheap 3 point foul",85,260,260,0.86,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='ibw2mk')>,,/r/nba/comments/ibw2mk/adam_silver_and_the_nba_need_to_do_something/,False

But this dude played so selfishly. So much so that westpaul literally pulled him from crunch time minutes. That would be like the spurs pulling prime Tony Parker for the last few minutes of a finals game. 

He continuously forced shots. At the worst times, too. He put up 17 and 6.5 assists but also had a super high usage and played 43 minutes a game. 

He shot 42 percent and was the second worst offensive rating (behind chambers) and the second worst defensive rating. So his numbers didn’t really help the team at all. He was also constantly getting torched by whoever he guarded, which was easy buckets whenever Jordan switched onto him in the post. 

Barkley says it a lot in a way where he doesn’t straight up call him out, but he has made comments about KJ not getting him the ball enough. That team needed a role playing point guard that could defend, not a selfish slashing inefficient point guard. 

Like a poor mans Russell Westbrook when he would take shots away from Durant.

He’s still a young man, and while stronger than he looks, I think still has another level he needs to get to to become truly unstoppable. 

The turnovers late in games, the random, flailing attempts at drawing fouls late in games, I think stems from strength fatigue down the stretch of games. 

The thing that I’m hoping for is that he will reach that level. By age 25-26 he’ll have more grown-man strength and be able to protect his handle better, attack the basket better, and absorb contact as he rises up for and-1s on jumpers rather than desperate attempts at fouls. It was the evolution Kobe went through when he put on some weight. Genetically, Kobe had more bounce, but it was mostly the added strength that gave him a lethal speed+skill+strength combination to be a nightmare. 


Knowing book, he is gonna make it happen with the work ethic he has and the already impressive strength he has for his stature. It’s just gonna take time.

I moved here 16 months ago at the height of the pandemic. I am m29 and married to a man.

I helped out an elderly neighbour with some work this summer and refused payment (it took 10 minutes, and I had the tools already). 

She then proceeded to invite me to church. I told her I wasn't interested. She then did what I now realize is intake to prove I need Jesus. I am not against just not curious. During her information, she asked many invasive questions without allowing me to do the same. It was one-sided and power trippy. She asked about my work, which I don't because I am trying to get on disability. She wondered why. I have 5+ diagnoses which don't allow me to work. She asked me how many pills I take. She asked me if I was married and to what gender. She asked me about my family life. It just went on. 

Because she told me she works at the hospital, I answered all the questions because I was taught that people working there are in a position to help. I did not use my best judgment, and she took advantage of that.

She calls my male spouse a wife and says I must work and attend church. She says we are friends and not a married couple, even when I correct her.

She is weaponizing her god to tell me not to take my meds and that everything will be okay if I don't and do attend church. 

I know I shouldn't talk to her, but she lives four doors down in the row house complex and is on the board and is always out walking like we are. 

I need to have an adult conversation with her to tell her I won't be coming to church, and she needs not question my relationship with my spouse. 

How do I do this? What do I say? I don't want this to escalate by avoidance.

Eta she is waiting for me to text her a time when I can go in June.

Eta part two: we are part of the same small HOA, and I would like her as an ally.

Hi all! I'm trying to create a Mondrian inspired pattern.

[Sample of Mondrian inspired style. My current WIP is size 4 yarn with 6.5mm hook using waistcoat & sc stitches. 12\\"" wide & will hopefully be 72\\"" long. The black lines are 2 sc wide.](https://preview.redd.it/bz3rttugi42b1.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=aba0783e428826eb837ece1449c41de17c1ccd6b)

I was originally going to make different squares and join, but it looks like doing it all row by row would look better (and I am not good at keeping consistent gauge yet). I found this one as proof of success: [""as I worked my way across the rows and color changes""](https://theartsandgeeksmovementblog.wordpress.com/2015/01/13/mondrian-inspired-scarf/) , but they don't have a pattern, and I can't find a way to contact them.

I don't know how they kept moving up and changing colors (specifically the small black lines) and also kept it nice and neat on the opposite side. All the youtube videos I watch end up with an unattractive back side with the dark color showing through the light color. (Including mosaics and pixel afghans.)

And making a tail after every 2 sc seems ridiculous (unless that is my only answer). I would prefer it to be double sided, but don't know how to achieve it.

Any tips or suggestions would be appreciated. Links to YouTube vids on how to do double sided short color changes would be super duper appreciated. Thanks in advance to this lovely community!

P.S. Some samples I found that still didn't help me:

I am a 27 year old with phimosis. For most of my life I had never bothered dealing with the condition until relatively recently.

Awhile back I managed to retract the foreskin passed the gland. Though this caused me paraphimosis. I managed to reverse this and pulled the skin back to cover it. 

Is it too late for me to treat my case with any option besides circumcision?

I am seeking feedback for my herpes disclosure template that I have just made. I appreciate all corrections that I can do to it from your suggestions/advices. Thanks. 

“Years ago, a man I had met a few times with had the cold sore virus on his mouth, all his life. At some point he asymptomatically infected me with that virus genitally. 

Now I get an outbreak on the back of my thigh from it, about once a year. So I take a medication episodically and it is called valacyclovir, to treat the outbreak. 

Asymptomatic transmission is a risk for people who do not already carry the infection genitally or orally. Due to viral shedding. The virus does this at the cellular level, hence asymptomatic. 

It is a very low percentage risk, in the single digits during the time-frame of a year. Condoms can help reduce the chances of transmission from certain physical contact that enables it to transmit. 

Ethically, it's advisable that I disclose my status to all potential partners before possible sexual contact.
