76,personalfinance,2023-01-15 03:01:35,MyBrainsPOV,About to make the most significant financial decision in my life and would love some feedback,"I have worked for a company for coming up on 11 years. I have about $200k in vested stock and exercised options with another $200-500k (unvested potential in 2+ years) of coming stock and options. I am ready to get out. I have spent months agonizing over this but after posting here several times with engagement, meeting with a fiduciary, and finally meeting with my CPA to discuss my 2022 and 2023 tax situations I have come to the conclusion that the following is now my plan:

Sell about $200k worth of stock

Put $20k aside for taxes either in an HYSA or CD or I-Bonds (wife and I)

Put $15k aside for an emergency fund (HYSA)

Put $22.5k aside for retirement investing

Put $140k into our house

Recast our mortgage and end up with around a $400 mortgage payment

Then the plan is to put all extra money into a taxable investment index fund account and sell stock in the next opportunity to put towards house (hopefully paying it off entirely within the next 2 years). 

Once our mortgage is in this position ($400 a month) we'll be putting all available cash into investments.

1. Sell about $50k worth of company stock
2. Max out my 401k ($22,500) for 2023
3. Max our my IRA ($6,500) for 2023
4. Max out my wife's IRA ($7,500) for 2023 (turned 50 in 2022 and stay at home mom/unemployed)
5.

83,personalfinance,2022-11-25 18:33:15,MyBrainsPOV,Giving $50k to my brother - What's the best way to do that?,"My brother is legally my foster brother. When our parents died neither had any assets worth much of anything. The only thing of value was the home which I bought outright over 20 years ago. However, I wanted to give him something and after a title lawsuit with other relatives, agent fees, etc, my wife and I decided on $50k. 

He doesn't need or want the money right now and wants me to help him get the most bang for his buck. We've looked into buying him a place to live (most likely a condo or trailer park home) but cost of living where he is is too high for $50k to make any kind of dent where he could afford the monthly payments, and he's not quite ready to move yet. 

Question #1 is do we keep this money until he's ready for it or do we gift it to him ASAP?

Question #2 is if we keep it until he's ready; how does growth work when we put it into a HYSA or CD or mutual funds etc? (he'd keep the interest not us). 

Seems like its less complicated if we gift it to him via 4 checks from my wife and myself in 2022 and 2023 and he just takes our advice on how to invest it but there's also concern of him spending it. It's a concern he is fully aware of and he wants us to help him. There is 100% transparency on everything. 

My current thought is to split the money between a HYSA and a 5 year CD. It looks like he could make between 8-11k if he left the money alone for 5 years that way.

Any help is appreciated. Thanks!",135,201,201,0.88,0,,/r/personalfinance/comments/z4kjc5/giving_50k_to_my_brother_whats_the_best_way_to_do/,False,True
88,personalfinance,2022-09-09 00:43:16,MyBrainsPOV,What is the best strategy for getting out of a very successful single stock all-eggs-in-one-basket situation,"I have no 401k, no significant savings, and just 1 company that I own stock in. It's a private company that I work for. Right now it's worth nearly $320k and by next year it should be worth over half a million dollars. In two years it could very realistically be worth over 1 million. It's very hard to walk away from this. However, I'm terrified having everything in one place that I cant even touch until they tell me I can. I am new to investing (besides accruing this stock) and am equally afraid of putting it into the stock market and have really bad FOMO. 

My biggest fear is selling stock, paying taxes on the capital gains, then taking that reduced amount and investing it elsewhere and watch it grow at less-than-even-anticipated lower rates; all while the single stock continues to skyrocket. 

I know that the right thing to do is diversify. But I cant help but feel like I'm walking away from such a huge opportunity. 

Part of me says that the current value, while high, isn't something that will significantly impact my life; especially after taxes. So maybe I just pretend it doesnt exist and cross my fingers and take that risk. The other part of me says cut and run, take control of the money and dont look back.

91,personalfinance,2022-08-05 03:46:54,MyBrainsPOV,How are my completely uneducated Roth 401k picks?,"I am 41 years old. I have no retirement. I have no debt besides my house. I have a 10 year plan to pay off my house that doesnt pull from any current savings. I have about $320k in company stock that should be double that in 2-5 years and I will be pulling about $15,000 per year minimum from that in the coming years for that 10 year plan of paying off the house. I may also take additional money out of that to transfer into more traditional and diversified investment options. 

I have never had a 401k plan. I am kind of overwhelmed by the process of choosing investments. I am trying to avoid managed accounts and paying a financial investor if possible. I chose these based on how old they were, their long term growth, and their minimal impact from the current financial dip. 

When I choose this I will divest my 15% into my company stock down to 5% so between stock and 401k I will be at 20% investing for my entire family (single income). 

Like I said we're debt free and doing fine. I think we'll be ok with 20% but I want to make sure my picks here are solid/ok. Thoughts? Thank you!

96,personalfinance,2022-06-03 01:16:48,MyBrainsPOV,Investing in 2022 with a looming recession question,"Hi all. What would you recommend I do for investing right now, in June 2022 with a crashing market and looming recession? I have no debt except the house. I have some cash from a parent passing situation. I have no 401k. I am 40 years old. My only other assets is stock in my company that I am pretty much going to pretend doesn't exist because selling it now could pay off my house but selling it in 5 years could fund my entire retirement. 

&#x200B;

I was playing with a mortgage pay-early calculator and it looks like if I put 50k towards my house then I'd save around 50 in interest. The higher I go from there, the interest savings starts tapering off (so 100k doesn't save 100k in interest it only saves $80k). 

&#x200B;

I get that the market is ""on sale right now"" but I have zero knowledge or toes dipped in yet, so I am not necessarily scared to invest I'm just very wet behind the ears and am nervous I'll jump in too early. I was thinking maybe 50k to my mortgage and 50k into the market at ""some point"" but want to get this community's advice. 

&#x200B;

I sought out advice from a fiduciary financial advisor that I found via the Dave Ramsey Smartvestor Pro network but he wanted 2.4% which sounded batshit insane so I didn't get involved with him. I know there's strong feelings about Dave Ramsey. I am not an idol worshipper so you don't need to save me but I do think he helps a lot of people. But again, I am open to all sorts of ideas.

102,personalfinance,2022-03-12 01:38:07,MyBrainsPOV,How should I structure a monetary gift to my foster brother after our shared parents have passed away?,"Here is our story: When I was 17 years old, in 1999, my step-mother was her grandmother's POA. It was time for her grandmother to go into 24/7 care and in course of her transitioning from living in her own place to moving into elder care; I purchased her house from her (through my step-mother as POA)\*. When I was 18, I moved out of the house and went to college; and my parents fostered a child around that same time. 

I am now 40 years old and he's about half that. We didn't have much overlap, but his experience of growing up was with my parents as his parents. Now that both parents have passed, and I am about to sell the house, I am trying to figure out how best to help my foster brother out. 

The details aren't yet established on the sale of the house but I should be able to give him somewhere between $45k-60k. The original idea was to ""take care of him"". That was what my parents wanted and I am truly excited to help realize that goal.

Where he lives, it is impossible to get into literally any living situation on that small investment. You cant even get into a mobile home park with that. So, the question is; what is the best way for me to help him? Do I....

1) Just give him the money and wish him good luck.

2) Give him the money and have a structured conversation with him about how best to use it, but leave it up to him.

3) Set up a trust or a mutual fund or something else, hand it over to him, and wish him luck.

4) Take an uncomfortable amount of control over this aspect of his life and be like a ""controller of the money"" somehow? Maybe put the money into some scenario where he cant touch it for a certain amount of time. I dunno...

5) Not give him any money, for now, work on growing it under my full control and give it to him at a later date. The idea here being that supposedly me being older means I'm somehow better with money and that I'll just manage it for the next 10-20 years then give him it when ""he's more mature"" and it's much more money and much more impactful and we're all pretending that I can control this entire process and he's in an amazing place in life when I give him the money...

6) Some other idea?

&#x200B;

\* The house is 100% mine. It is not an inheritance. There is no legal requirement to share the proceeds from the sale of the house. Also; I am 100% committed to this idea. He'll get the money; I am just trying to figure out what is the best way to help him out in the long run. I came into money when I was young and I wasted a lot of it. I don't want to burden him with me being some kind of caretaker of his future, but I also don't want to take this opportunity that he has and just throw it away if there's a better option here.

Looking for some car shopping advice here.

Background: I am currently in the market for a car. I would love to have a car that fits my needs and desires(attractive appearance, comfort, sound experience (I’m an audiophile). I am currently full time employed , taking home around 74K post tax. I have 20K invested in stocks currently for taking advantage of the all time lows, I have 5K in a HYSA, employer is currently maximally matching contribution to my 401K. Expecting a promotion in the next few months to up to 77K post tax. I am getting married in 6 months. Expecting to buy a new house in 3 years. 

Test Driving a bunch of cars one that truly fits all my desires is a Lexus IS350, 2021 model that’s slightly used with 14K mileage prices at 43K. A 72 month loan is what I was looking at, with payments coming to around $675-$700/ month based on 7-8% interest rate. After insurance quotes,gas and maintenance expectations this may come to around 17-18% of my income. I’ll still save a decent amount for my future events.

I guess I am looking for advice at whether this is financially wise. I could swing for a lower priced car and sacrifice my desire and wants for 3 years of my young life, and possibly save $8-$10K. But is my rationale for what I truly want and would like financially reasonable to pursue this car?

I reached out to HR (when I still worked there) to confirm my 5 days of vacation would be paid out, and they sent me a non-answer along with a formula for calculating how unpaid time off gets paid out (earned PTO is pro-rated by the amount of time worked since review (in my case, 6-months) so I would only be paid out 2.5 days instead of the 5 days I had available to use. HR even used my situation in the example formula to explain this. 

I received my final paycheck today and it didn’t have any PTO payouts added on. I emailed HR asking about when they would be sending it, and their response was another formula they use for calculating PTO payouts, but this time they used the sum total of of PTO I was eligible to use throughout the year (120 hours) and it determined I was not eligible for a PTO payout since I was only eligible for 60 hours and I used 72 hours.

My paid time off never accrued - it was available for me to use as soon as my review was processed. I asked my supervisor if he knew of this policy and he said that he didn’t know that was a thing either. If I wanted to be a jerk I could have used my PTO for the second week of my two week notice, but since HR explained it in a way that made me think I was eligible for at least half of it to be paid out since I gave them a two week notice.

Is there anything I can do? I don’t have access to my email anymore confirming I addressed this with HR prior to leaving the company. I got a job with a larger company in the industry and fully intended to use my previous employer as a possible vendor, so I don’t want to burn any bridges but I’m kind of upset by this and it’s leaving me with a pretty awful taste in my mouth.",2,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/personalfinance/comments/13t06fu/am_i_entitled_to_an_used_pto_payout_in_this/,False,False
150,personalfinance,2023-05-27 06:37:35,StepEfficient864,Pay off my house with 401k funds?,"I owe $77k on my home. I have about $450k in 401k and IRA. 

Why? 

The interest Id pay on the loan would be more than the income tax I’d pay on a $77k withdrawal. 

Homeowners Ins has doubled in 2 years and I’m in the middle of the state (Florida). I’m thinking about taking a Fire Policy to save $$ but have to pay off loan. Auto policy renewals are coming in at 40-50 percent increases. Mine comes up in August. Dreading it. 

Why not? 

I’m on Medicare so I’m covered. Wifey uses Obamacare. We’d be over the income threshold to get a subsidy for Obamacare. We’re also considering her taking a job where she can get insurance just for herself. 

By taking out a substantial sum like that I lose the ability to realize stock gains and dividends. I’ve calculated that the future value of $77k at 4% for 20 years to be $168,000. I’d have to forego that. 

We could wait til she gets on Medicare to payoff the house.",7,3,3,0.67,0,,/r/personalfinance/comments/13t05px/pay_off_my_house_with_401k_funds/,False,False
