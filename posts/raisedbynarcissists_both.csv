237,raisedbynarcissists,2022-09-01 15:49:34,SakuraNightGlow,Vent About My Mom and My Thoughts On What To Do,"So, I'm 19 and have lived with my nmom ever since. I think I'm just going to let out everything I feel about her and what I remember.
So this woman was apparently supposed to be a child psychologist, she studied 2 years of it yet she acts nothing like a decently compassionate and caring parent. She's both emotionally and physically abused me my entire life, instances I don't remember that she for some reason told me and others I can never forget.
When I was a baby, I was pretty chatty according to my family. And I guess I was too chatty for my mom. Because one day she said she got so annoyed with my talking that she punched me hard enough to break my nose. I don't know how that wasn't an instant indicator you weren't ready to raise another human being if you can't even prevent yourself from breaking your baby's nose but alright :) From what I remember she also said she lied about how my nose got broken because idk who would just let that slide.
And then I got older. For the most part she was okay until I started to become more shy and reserved. She always thought something was wrong with me and still does for my sudden change in personality. But by that point she was already becoming abusive and only reason why I assume she did is because of my shift in personality. I was also ""lucky"" enough to be her golden child, I always got amazing grades and behaved well in school and I still do my best to keep that up now just because I'm so used to it. But through that came all the screaming and degrading if I got any grade lower than an A. I've always hated when this woman told me ""Always aim to do your best. If you can get a 90, go for a 95 next time! And next time get 100!"" No. That's nearly impossible please shut up.
But back to her thinking something was wrong with me because I started becoming shy. She took it upon herself to enlist me in school therapy. And that was the worst mistake she could have done and it's what made me realize she was abusing me. I was casually talking to my therapist about some stuff that happens at home and remarked certain things she's done. Like yelling at me, degrading me, throwing objects at me including cleaning liquids. My therapist reasonably got nervous and calls CPS. I got nervous since knowing eventually they would come and told my mom. And my god this woman put on a damn show because she started crying, asking me why I did this to her and if I hate her. Man was I so unaware of what she's done to me it makes me furious now, and she used that to her advantage before. The social worker sadly found nothing wrong. After that, my mom went from being so sad I did this to damning me to hell. She thought I called the social worker, and claimed something like that stays on your record (I really hope it does now) and she told my entire family how I called CPS on her and thank goodness they weren't around that often by then because then it would have gone worse. But sadly I know how that would have gone now.
But I was devastated and this is really where her abuse began to shine towards me.
She immediately took me out of therapy, started to continuously talk me down and make me feel miserable on purpose, and physically abused me constantly. I remember her lifting a chair, about to throw it onto me before I screamed and begged her to leave me alone, but before that she was screaming and yelling at me and my dad was in the same room and did NOTHING until that moment. Which he always does, nothing. And all he did was just tell her to calm down. Same with an instance of her literally choking me, which she did 3 times in total in my life, and my dad was around for 2 of those times and again. Nothing. I had to push her off every single time and lock myself in my room. So yeah, lovely middle school experience. Made my anxiety form and skyrocket and I would have panic attacks every time I thought she'd hurt me.
She then placed me in therapy with a therapist who always took her side. I forgot how I stopped attending that therapy but good fucking riddance I hate that therapist. And then I was placed in therapy to a place closer to our new apartment. Both my therapists there were lovely. Yet the first one had to go. Because she too called CPS after I told her about the second time my mom tried to choke me which was some days before my session, and how my dad did nothing and just told this she beast to relax, as if that's going to do anything. And that time I was hysterical, begging my therapist to not call and I didn't want to go home after she made the call. I was too scared because the last time this happened I got horribly abused. And the same happened. Except this time, my family was strung along. Constantly demanding to talk to me. Constant accusing and belittling from nearly everyone, saying I deserve to feel horrible for what I apparently did because I guess I made the call and wasn't horrified for my life at the thought that I was going to be in a living hell for the next months? All of this for confiding in someone that she fucking choked me, and I'm told I'm the bad guy. Best example is one of my half siblings from my dad's side (because he's left multiple families) and said half sibling comparing her situation to mine, talking up my mom and how great of a parent she is. Even went through my phone to find something?? Idk what because all I do is talk to the little friends I have in there. I tried going to sleep to just constantly hear her ask if I'm still awake and I thought she was going to try understanding me but every time, she would use that to continue to talk shit about me and how horrible and stupid I am. Thanks so much for making my anxiety flare at hearing the words you used to describe me, now I never spoke to you since. So yeah, therapists changed and I regret leaving my most recent one. I loved her a lot and she was very sweet and comforting to me. My mom hated her because she made me feel safe but eventually she has no say in taking me out of therapy because I was an adult and I got to chose when to leave. And leaving therapy was my decision because I was finally getting better. But now it's getting bad again. Since then my mom broke one of my fingers, choked me AGAIN and in front of my sister this time who was paralyzed in fear. I actually had to claw at my mom because pushing her off wasn't enough and she took A PICTURE saying *I* abused her and that she could take me to court for that?? I deleted the picture of course but the audacity she has to physically assault me, I defend myself, and she says I hurt her. And then the most recent things that happened.
She was off on vacation to DR. And it was those times where she was nicest to me. When I was nowhere near her. And then when I came over for my vacation, which I could barely call one because I was busy with college transferring issues and so much emailing and video calls half of the time. Right before we went to a resort my dad was fighting with my sister and then he all of a sudden wanted to include me in it. I got angry and then my mom comes in the room asking me why I'm yelling across the hall to him and I simply said ""You constantly yell at me when we live in an apartment complex where vents are connected to other apartments. People always hear you screaming. But we're in a house, who's going to hear me screaming?"" And she shut up thankfully. Oh yeah and she also mentioned how me and my sister have been ruining our vacation when that was literally the first time we ever ""acted out""? Okay then. And then the day we left back to our city.
An uncle came over and was going to leave as I was just waking up. I was really tired and trying to wake myself up and my mom took that as being rude I guess because after he left she said ""Don't worry, I know how much you hate it here. You're never coming back."" And I got just fed up by that point. I came into her room and was constantly asking her why does she hate me so much? Why does she always assume the worst of me? Why does she think a normal person can simply change their demeanors in a flash like her two faced self?? She just kept telling me I'm insane and crazy and odious, her favorite word to call me. Then eventually I said ""This is why we can never be on the same page. You assume the worst of me and all I do is try and try to fix our relationship as mother and daughter. That therapist you took me to, thinking those kids who bullied me were the problem? Yeah remember she told you, YOU need to get your act together and stop making me feel like shit! What is your problem with me?!"" ""How's about you just stop trying to 'fix' things, because I will never understand you.""
After that, it was the first time I wondered why I was born and thought that if I didn't have friends who cared about me, there would be no reason for me to go on. And I cried. A lot.
And after I calmed down I just decided you know what. Fine.
I'm not talking to her anymore unless I need to bring something up. I'm not going to say hi to her or wish her good night. I'm going to ignore her everytime she's in my room. I can't stand caring about her opinion because if I keep doing that to myself, I'm actually going to kill myself.
But things are going to get better.
Because the university I transferred to is 3/4 hours away from this toxic household. I know I'll be so much happier next semester.
As for my sister, at first I felt guilty leaving her behind. But she's clearly the favorite in both my parents eyes, but especially my mom's. Because she never laid a hand on her. There have been times my dad has hurt me too. But never my sister. I'm not jealous of her, we're very close, as close as siblings could be, as I had to be her emotional and well, parental support because none of our actual parents wanted to do their jobs outside of paying bills and putting food on the table. But at least I don't have to worry about her getting abused while I'm away because it's me my parents want.
I can't wait to move away. And I'm also glad I won't be going back to my parents home country. When it's brought up I'll just say ""No no, remember mom. I 'hated being there'. I 'hate my family and everything around me'. I'm 'odious'. You made it clear and you know what, you're right. I have to focus on my studies in my own country. Reguardless, I don't want to go to a place where my own family would hate me reguardless. If they knew my morals and who I love, they would hate me as much as you hate me and never want to speak to me again. So I'm good, I'd rather stay in a country with people that actually enjoy my company and people who actually want me around. Go have your vacation! :D""
So yeah, this is very long but I had to let this out somewhere since I may not have time for a therapist with my college workload sadly. Or I could look into a counselor from my campus that can do virtual sessions, idk.
Anyways thanks if you read this far. Let me know what you think and if I should do anything else besides ignoring my ""parents"".
From this point forward they're not considered my parents, they're just a woman and man who I have to bare with sharing a living place until I move out.",1,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/x3b1s6/vent_about_my_mom_and_my_thoughts_on_what_to_do/,False,True
239,raisedbynarcissists,2022-07-07 01:40:25,SakuraNightGlow,I wish there was a rule to not call CPS if a child is begging you not to.,"This may sound very weird to some people but hopefully most can agree with me; So I have narcissistic and abusive parents. Specifically my mother is the abuser and my dad watched the abuse happen and did nothing to help me and in fact sides with her a couple of times and even did put his hands on me a couple of times.
But basically, CPS has been called to my house twice. Twice, nothing was done. And twice, I was horrendously abused for it and nowadays, there are still moments here and there when it happens. My mom always loves to bring those incidents up about how I ""betrayed her"" as though she didn't do what she's done to me and told my entire family and made them all hate me.
For that, I wish my therapists NEVER called CPS on my household. After those two incidents, they were the worst moments of my life and lowest.
The second time they were called, I was begging to not go home and even tried to call other family members to have me stay over at their place.
In all honesty, if a child is literally begging you not to call CPS, trust me, it's seriously better not to. Not only does CPS barely do anything in most cases, because my mother and most parents in these cases are manipulative, of course they'd get away with what they've done, but in the many cases where no child is taken out of the home, they will be in hell for a good, long while and it will make their situation far, far worse.
Literally the only time that won't happen is if there was a very blown out of proportion misunderstanding and the parents are actually kind and understanding.
This was just a random rant but I hope some people can agree with me on this, because both these instances really riled up my anxiety and made me realize the hard way that my family does not care about me in the slightest.",1,2,2,1.0,0,,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/vt6kjc/i_wish_there_was_a_rule_to_not_call_cps_if_a/,False,True

907,raisedbynarcissists,2022-01-13 19:28:40,cyborgmonkey-,Boring nightmares and flashbacks?,"I’ve been diagnosed with CPTSD by a couple of different therapists and doctors. Both of my parents were extreme narcissists. My mom was covert, so her abuse was more subtle, and my dad was just an asshole and proud of it. It’s been years of therapy and medications. I finally went fully NC not just with them but also with my equally damaged siblings. I had been their black sheep target of abuse for years. 


For about a year or two now I have been having these strange recurring nightmares. It started with insomnia, then these extremely vivid dreams that would be erased from my memory almost immediately.  But after more than a year of them I’ve gotten enough snippets to know that they are dream recreations of various stages of my youth and young adulthood. The dreams themselves are all innocuous like getting groceries or something mundane, but there is always this sense of despair. I know that there are some that are scary or intense somehow because they wake me up when I try to fall asleep but I can’t recall anything of them whatsoever. I realized that I spend half the day dreading having to sleep again.


On top of that I have little split second flashback memories with the same despair emotion all day long. These memories can be of dreams, or real memories, but they always just suck emotionally no matter how bland the memories are.


I’ve been undergoing EMDR therapy so I assume that is stirring stuff up. I really wish I could find a way to get an understanding of these dreams and move on. I want to enjoy my life now instead of being stuck in the past that I hated.


I’m curious if anyone has had any non traditional therapies that would go beyond what I am doing and are financially feasible? I need this to stop.",2,3,3,1.0,0,,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/s37gtu/boring_nightmares_and_flashbacks/,False,True
908,raisedbynarcissists,2022-01-05 08:00:14,cyborgmonkey-,Cursed birthday.,"These were my first no contact holidays. Just my wife and the kids. It was so peaceful. Such a good Christmas it made me sad. In a few days I turn forty. I hate winter. My birthday has always been cursed. My narcissistic mother might take me to dinner. But we couldn't tell my narcissistic father. If we had anything it was just us. Just them and me. Maybe I got an obligatory happy birthday. It wasn't an issue of money. It was a huge house filled with shit. I just wasn't worth it.  I'm already in therapy with depression, flashbacks, and nightmares. And medicated. 

My wife asked what I wanted/wanted to do for my birthday. But every time I try to think of something I might like to celebrate with or get I have a panic attack and feel nauseous. I want to have a good birthday. I feel like whatever I pick will be wrong, and I will be left disappointed, but picking nothing would also mean the same.

911,raisedbynarcissists,2021-11-24 16:47:20,cyborgmonkey-,I went no contact. I feel so much better.,"It was about the third time she brought up my 8!!!! year old son’s weight, always because she was trying to “help” since “other” people could be mean. I already had to overcome body dysmorphia myself. That alone had me ready to cut contact. Then in the same conversation she said “I’ve never been critical” and I laughed out loud. She acted offended. I started calling out things she had done including the bs comments about my son’s weight, just like she had done with me. I had previously started compiling a list of various mean comments and things they had done to me. With her it was covert so it took me until now, nearly 40, to see the extent of the damage. I went to the list and just started listing stuff off to her. I kid you not it was like the scene in the movie where the shapeshifter is dying and shifting through all the forms it took. She went to tactic after tactic after tactic just getting more and more desperate when I didn’t take the bait. 

At last I said “Don’t expect a call.” Hung up. Blocked her number. Then I sent a text to my narcissist dad and told him he had never once acted like an actual loving father and that I was blocking him too.

That was it. I felt free, like I could breathe, but I also felt guilt, particularly toward her, because that had always been her favorite hook to use. I would wonder if she was upset, but I would also think that she is probably absolutely giddy inside from the drama she can milk out of it with her friends. Then I’d think of the damage she would do to my son given the chance and I would get angry and more determined. Even if I felt some guilt I had no choice when it came to defending him.

My wife was very supportive right from the get go. She never liked them and hated how they acted to me and although she saw the abuse she knew I was too stubborn if pushed and she patiently waited for me to see it. God bless her for that! I have a friend from when I was young who saw the abuse first hand and was supportive. My in-laws have been kind and loving and make sure I know I am part of their family. I also have a great therapist, mental health nurse practitioner (I just call her a psychiatrist because she is actually better).

I’m fortunate to have all that. I wish everyone did. They and the list helped me in moments of doubt, and I’ve continued to add to it.

It has been several weeks or a month since I went no contact. The first few days I felt like I could breathe for the first time ever. I did struggle with guilt as I mentioned. I also struggled with sadness and grief. I had finally let go of expecting them to ever change. I had to grieve for that loss of hope.

Now however, I am starting to feel much better. My wife sees it too and tells me I look healthier, stand straighter, express my needs constructively, and just generally have more confidence and more willingness to be myself. My compulsive spending even went down.

I literally look up more. Walking out of the local store I’d be looking at the car or the ground. Now I walk out and I see the mountains and misty clouds and sky.

It was a drastic step but it was the right one. Society constantly tells us that we can’t do that. That we have to put up with it. We don’t. I hope those of you who read this and need to take that step will find the strength and support to pull through it. For those who have done it and still struggle I hope you find relief.

I wrote this post in hopes that it could bring hope to those of you facing this decision. I’m not saying it is always the right call, but if you need to make it you should not beat yourself up.

All through childhood. They would yell and scream, my mom would come tell me all about how mean my dad would have been to me. Then she would lean on me for emotional support.

On the other hand if I expressed anger or sadness it was always immediately dismissed as unimportant.

My wife is soooo glad they are gone, but sad for what I'm going through,

Despite what I logically know emotionally I'm not there. I question and doubt myself. But then  always come back to the countless nasty things they've done and said.

They're divorced now. He is off playing as though he did nothing wrong, and she has still been trying to lean on me for all her emotional needs. She gave me body dysmorphia and was aready trying to be ""helpful"" because she was ""concerned"" about my 8 year old sons weight.

While I've been on disability and in and out of IOP she still wants to tell me every sad detail of every person she knows and every illness they have and how sad it makes her.

Regarding my dads abuse when they divorced, she said ""I was abused for 30 years.""

I replied ""Yeah me too.""

And then she said ""Well at least your young and still have lots if your life left.""

Total dismissivness of the pain they caused me. 

She also gaslights and considers herself a saint so she can't understand why I could possibly be mad at her. It's so frustrating questioning my sanity when i know for a fact I'm not crazy and other people saw and said the same things about her.

So in trying to tame the guilt I think over these things and get angry. Then I just feel both.

“You're just like your father!”

“You’re just like your mother!”

These were never good comparisons.

If one half was bad, and the other half was bad, did that mean I was just bad? 

I remember being pulled from bed at night, after the usual yelling, and taken with my mother to her friends house. “Are you going to get a divorce?” I don’t know how old I was, but I knew what it meant.

“No sweetie, it was just a bad fight.” I felt such disappointment.

“I wish you would.” 

Then she was away, detailing all the drama to her friend. I could hear them talking, light coming in from the hall.  Her friend collected porcelain clowns. There were shelves lining the walls. Dozens of creepy clowns, a strange bed, more fighting but no hope for an end. It was the bright moon that comforted me.

Ten older siblings. Three from his prior marriage, and seven from hers. His were regularly beaten, hers were neglected or used for her emotional support. Most were already adults and scattered to the wind. There are none that I trust.

I remember being alone in the woods. Him and a truck, his usual scowl. We picked up my brother from a camp. They fought about me. There were only two seatbelts, so that meant I was loved better. I don’t blame my brother. He was a kid. 

When he ran, he was chased down and beaten, then dragged back to the truck where he asked “What about my bloody nose?”

“Use your sock.” 

These are my very first memories. My introduction to the world. 

Of my siblings, the seven on her side were the oldest, then the three on his, and then me, between the two of them. My previously mentioned brother was the closest in age. He spent some time with us, and some with his mother. I was somehow the youngest, and yet also an only child, with siblings who felt more like aunts and uncles.

He couldn’t beat me like he could his prior kids, but he did beat them in front of me. I’m sure they felt resentment. With her kids it was the fact that we had money and they had been poor. Either way I was the lucky “golden” child, left alone to watch it all fall apart, to be clung to by one and despised by the other, to be a nephew or brother whenever it was convenient, to be treated like a child and held accountable like a man, to nurture her wounds while enduring his since the time I could talk.

He was drunk and angry. They would yell and slam doors. There would always be disagreements about me. Then she would come and cry and tell me all the mean things he would have said and bask in the glory of protecting me from him.  All while I was comforting her.

I'm in a situation where I have no license or car and a bike with no storage my narc doesn't have access to, which means he can and will pop the tires as often as he can, which means I'll either have to keep getting them fixed or continue relying on him for rides unless I can finance a car (which he historically has also sabotaged), which obviously takes funds away from moving out and extends my time here...and so on.

That alone makes it daunting enough to find a ""cover job"", because he'll make it as difficult as possible to even maintain it, but he'll also be able to predict how much money I'll be getting and be especially invasive of/manipulative with my finances and purchases, even if I keep them personal, as I have a right to do.

I barely even trust him not to mess with my things while I'm out of the house, so naturally I'm hoping to move out as quickly as possible. But knowing I have very little way of transporting things, other than a UHaul truck (important note to remember as I'm writing this), and that he plays games with money and likes to stalk me, how do I even begin looking for a place that he won't know about? How do I keep the address secret anyway?

I've had roommate offers from a few contacts before, and I trust them. I'm not especially willing to put them in his path, but maybe I could arrange a safehouse situation, where I have a facade place he knows about and a second, real place he doesn't. Might also be very pricey and take a while to get to, but maybe worth it if it means he's not forcing my reliance on him and his involvement in my life anymore?

If I can even figure out how to safely get to and from my job and how much I can tell him about anyway (preferably *nothing*, but it's a cover job, and I might have to come up with a cover for the cover...)...

How have you who have gotten out handled it? How do you manage to get into a privately-known new place and go no-contact and not let them know at the same time? Worried he might do something like trick the keys out of me so he can copy them, because I do tend to be fairly naive and manipulatable and he has a known habit of going through pockets and stealing/misplacing/copying keys, and I'm fairly sure he'd stop at nothing to get access to wherever I'm living unless I can reasonably prevent it.

Knowing I was right. Knowing I'll be hated for the effect their actions had on me, and for the way I had to be in situations that weren't my fault. For the choices I had to make to survive the choices they made, and knowing how he'll make up all these wonderful things from my childhood (his version of it, anyway) while putting down the actual living version of me just because I wouldn't fall in line (and sacrifice the person I made myself into without him in order to work with and appease him, even though I don't and shouldn't have to do that).

He's already getting to a point where he's idealizing and memorializing a childhood version of me that never existed and a version of my childhood that never existed. Showing appreciation for things that never happened or that he barely even noticed at the time, if at all. But now that it's convenient to make these stories up and pretend he had a different version of me to treasure than the one standing up for myself and setting boundaries he doesn't appreciate, he's started doing it more and more, and it's hilarious how different our stories of that version of me are.

And there's no way I can really say different. ""That's not what happened,"" because I know it's not, but it just sounds and feels like he's talking about a dead child instead of working with the one that's still in front of him - the one he always cast off and humiliated and ignored until it was too late and we both realized the damage was already done, and he realized he had lost my trust and respect with everything I've figured out he's done to me.

So now he's clinging to a fake history and telling stories about the version of me that's still alive behind my back with all of his collaborators and the people who helped, and he gets to act like the perfect, loving father I always tried to believe he was, and I know that's just the way it goes. And I've accepted that. But it's sad. I know how many kids these sorts of things happen to.

1188,raisedbynarcissists,2023-05-20 10:57:42,The_Teacat,"Not sure where to put this. Family member stole my property, makes excuses, plays games.","I'm in a shit situation and not sure what to do. A family member claims to have taken a box of important books of mine to the thrift store, but for various reasons, I don't believe they did. Now, I know that they *did* take the books; the box is gone, so in any of the four possible scenarios I can think of, it is definitely deleted and out of my hands.

They've been cleaning the area where I temporarily was forced to store them and I, in my attempt to assume I didn't have to specifically list an entire itemized inventory for them to know not to touch my things, assumed it wouldn't be included. In the past, this person has had a habit of taking other people's things to the garbage dump, including video tapes and useful electronics that were not their property, and only recently started ""taking things to the thrift store"", but I can only confirm that's their destination if I'm involved, and I recently have not been able to be.

They claim they ""didn't know"" the books were mine. As the majority of what they've been clearing out was their partner's property, and for various unfortunate reasons, a lot of mine is mixed in, *and* because I haven't been able to help in the way I traditionally have and needed to be (specifically for things like this), they had an easy excuse: ""There are lots of books around here that were just going unread, so I thought...!""

...1) there are not that many books. All of the books that there are were either hers or mine, and it was obvious which ones are mine. 2) This person *knows* I value books and do actively read them, but they personally are against such intellectualism and have been trying to offload things from their life as a means of self-preservation and power tripping, so of *course* you either need to be achingly overly specific (and have them do a genie routine and find loopholes in every single thing you say), exhaustingly involved (and open yourself up to their constant self-obsessions), or accept that your property is never, ever safe and they'll always have an excuse for it.

So, box of books is gone. The claim is they're at the thrift store, which I don't specifically believe due to past behavior and social track record of the involved individual. Upon questioning, they claim they're maybe willing to go there with me and see about ""getting them back""; I am unable currently to fix problems like this on my own, making it more infuriating that it might have happened at all. (They like to play games with my neurodivergences and attachments specifically to get meltdown-style rises out of me, and set my progress in life back constantly. This is not the first time something like this has happened, and it almost always follows a period of time in which they're *especially* narcissistically manipulative to drive me to the point of total isolation and grey rocking, so they can claim that I bothered them and follow it up with other events similar to this that are seemingly specifically designed to infuriate me for being uncontrollable and setting boundaries with them. Fun!)

However, again, I don't believe they took them anywhere but the garbage dump, but I am concerned that the whole thing is a game to humiliate me, waste my time, and get rid of my books that I need while laughing to themselves in their power trip. (It was known that they were my books; however, they weren't *specifically* marked and this person is very good at getting away with doing very terrible things with social manipulation, ""I don't remember""s, and ""I assumed"" this and thats. So, inherently frustrating as a person to deal with.)

So, I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to waste a Saturday and give them attention they don't deserve, knowing they very likely are not at the thrift store. I'd like to let the books go, knowing I might never see them again excepting if I try and remember what they were and hope to repurchase them. But some of them were valuable research copies I had filled with notes and study work, and all of them were necessary for my work; without them, I can't really get any of my writing or research done, so I'm almost completely out of ways to continue making money doing what I'm good at. (This is known to this person too, because I keep going on about how important these things are and how much I need this work, revealing *exactly* the things they can use to toy with me. 🙃)

It's infuriating that they would do something like this; not surprising. But the latest in a long line of similar behavior patterns against me. I can maybe spend this weekend with them trying to fix it. But there doesn't seem to be an easy win here. I was planning on spending this weekend working since this is my first one actually free in quite sometime, and I'm fairly sure this person *knew* that so of course they'd set me back like this.

But. Advice is definitely desired. What can I do? Is there anything I should be doing here? I've been high tension for days because of the sudden loss and change of plans and environment situations. Obviously it's not very pleasant.

Sorry if this isn't the right subreddit to post this on. I was going to post it to some of the autistic ones, but as the person involved is one of my n-family members, it definitely feels more appropriate for this one.

1189,raisedbynarcissists,2023-05-18 15:55:44,The_Teacat,Bit of a vent...grey rocking is the hardest thing I know I have to do. There always seems to be so few real ways to adjust when no contact is no option.,"(ETA: Flaired as rant/vent because, although I feel like support might help, I'm not sure what would be most helpful. As you'll see, I do know most of what I *should* be able to do realistically-speaking, so I'm not sure about the advice thing, but I'm not opposed to advice at all. I also know that just talking about what has happened and knowing people have heard it helps validate the experiences, but that's no one's job except maybe a therapist...and the therapist racket in my area is, uhm, very much less than stellar and that can and has been used against me in the past, so...? Ahhhhhh? TFW your experiences lead you to overexplain and overthink everything.)

When they know every detail about you, when they're expert manipulators, when their plan for you goes back years and you're just beginning to realize how stupid you were, when you can barely move without them knowing. When you have to shut down and sacrifice when you've already lost everything, and when they use even that against you.

Grey rocking is the hardest thing you can do. Watching it all fall apart...hoping the next thing you do might help you get out. Knowing what it's going to cost you to help you escape. Realizing keeping yourself safe and hidden just isn't enough, all while exhaustingly keeping yourself shut down and as apathetic as possible to give them as little as possible. While everyone you cared about fades away because they can't help you and you can't even talk about what's happening, let alone save yourself. (They made sure of that years before I realized what they were even doing. I was innocent and stupid then, and it took me too long to catch on, longer still to figure out where their plans were going, and longer after that to figure possible ways out. In a game I never wanted to play in the first place.)

I read the guide on narcissistic traits (as if I don't know from experience already...) and good lord, it's terrifying how many specific memories seem directly referenced by the article. Although for me, it's a male parent...something that makes it even more especially humiliating to talk about, since - as in the article - he's very competitive and likes to screw with my grooming and self-worth habits, and what grown male adult wants to admit their own male parent is doing things like that to them? (My mother, while she was alive, was their other toy like this and she never even really realized it. I tried to help, but they separated us and she ended up not believing me at all. Probably should've ensured better security for myself and for her before I did that. But that was in the earliest stages of waking up to what they're doing, and when they began to realize I was realizing now too.)

I used to see a bright future, and I knew I was almost there. I can still see it somedays. I've always had parts of me *know* these things were happening even as I watched every opportunity I gave myself be stolen away and ripped apart, but I've always struggled with being slow and naive and it's taken me far too long to put the pieces together. Usually I don't realize what the goal was of a particular step in the plan was until hours or days afterward; and it's deeply unsettling to know there *is* one and more exhausting to have to spend hours figuring out what it is just so you can suggest ways to yourself to counteract and escape it. Or at the very least, hopefully survive emotionally long enough to see another day.

There was even a time they teamed up and were so much and so intimidating that I was completely convinced and *terrified* that they were going to kill me. I still think they might. And maybe that’s part of it. But I had no way to show an intention so I couldn't call for authority's help like my friends kept suggesting I do, and obviously I couldn't reach out to my friends for backup, as that's unfair, harmful, and not something anyone should really have to do.

But regardless, I lost what was left of my friend group that weekend. Leaving me with only everyone online I was smart enough not to talk to about it, and very little support overall. (Largely because I'm just not situationally-stable and secure enough to be able to continue maintaining friendships in a safe way, so I can't commit to anything, I can't provide anything, I can't make a single plan without knowing he'll ruin it as soon as he learns - or already have found a way to schedule my future just a few days ahead. One of the first and most regularly recurring ways I ended up losing *most* of the things I was once so on top of. - , so everything falls by the wayside.)

So much of the things on this list have happened to me...he even ruined me financially in a deeply insidious way, and in some other ways I've been trying to investigate just so I can figure out exactly what and how he did it, and that was one of the earliest ways I really caught on to what he was doing with me. He only recently decided to undo some of that (without telling me anything, of course, although by now it's too late, and I have very few ways of carrying on *without* relying on his involvement and continued knowledge of those things). He's still manipulating my financials and it's all I can do to figure out ways around it. I am 30 years old and terrified to even try and get another job for fear of what he might do with the money coming in, or how my personal documents might disappear behind my back again, or so on and so on...

Anyway. I don't wanna say I don't know what to do...I know what I *need* to do (maintain work, keep financials decent, figure out a potential safe roommate situation, learn to let things to and unfortunately have to sacrifice to be safe). And it's all the hardest things I can imagine. I know I'm holding myself back in some ways; certainly the apathy, long-term emotional shutdowns for safety's sake, and lingering attachments to things I thought would be safe and treasured but can only be used against me (and have, very recently and constantly) are huge detriments. But I can barely even leave my room without keeping a thousand different things in mind to keep myself ready to defend against his games and the overall plan.

I'm hoping I'll be able to be out soon. But it keeps getting worse. So we'll see. Hoping to hear back about jobs, and worried about what happens after that. (As more of my art supplies vanish, and recently, a box of books I needed and was actively using for research and my once-hopeful professional career...they always go after your passions. And always the ones that could help you/uplift you the most. I want to scream.)

None of it is where I wanted to be right now. I guess that's inevitable...thanks all for listening even a little bit. Talking and writing about it somewhere helps to some degree. I only wish I could use this time and energy to get back to my career and my passions.

2004,raisedbynarcissists,2020-04-07 16:20:12,introvertedfreak21,I think having seizures has made my dad a narcissist.,"So, here is the context to the story. I'm a 22 female.

I live with my dad and step mom since I was 11. Well, my dad never had any mental problems as I grew up but I do believe he took advantage of my need for approval because he would just teach me to do as I am told instead of think for myself. As I've gotten older, I have started to see more and more of how badly that affected my image of myself. I would get unbelievably depressed if I thought I hurt someone. I truly believed that if I am not helping someone, I'm worthless. That if I don't always help my friends when they are in need, I am a bad friend. It was so grounded in my head that I need to help others that I never stopped to help myself.

Now that I am 22 years old, I've started to gain more confidence. My father was diagnosed with generalized eplisey about a year ago but doctors believe it could be form a blockage in his heart making it hard to get air to his brain properly. He was gonna get catheter in his heart before COVID-19 really took a hit and his surgery was canceled. But before that, I left my warehouse job so that I could help him go back to working as a independent contractor. I wasn't gonna make.much at all since I couldn't lift anything due to scoliosis but I thought that it wouldn't be so hard since I was helping my dad and I thought he would respect what I say since we were using my truck. However, every time his boss yelled at him for something that wasn't his mistake(store damaged product but claim it isn't damaged), he would want to drink. First few times I just endured it because I wanted to help my dad. Soon enough it was becoming so often that I had enough of it, it was so bad he left my unlocked, running vechile to buy alcohol while I was in a gas station to use the bathroom and buy a drink. I eventually made a sign that state there would be no alcohol allowed in my vehicle because I just couldn't stand his drinking anymore, it was to a point I would drop his drunk butt at a bar to be picked up by my step mom while I go to my boyfriend's house bawling like a baby because it was just too much emotional stress. I was having to help him when he had seizures(he would normally have only two on stressful days but there have been times up to four and this was going form once a month to sometimes once a week) so his drinking on top of it was really getting to my own mental state and I was depressed being around him.

So, recently his boss has pretty much laid him off without actually firing him(just not giving him jobs to do but still having him employed) because my father seemed to have a stroke one night but refused to let my step mom and I take him to the hospital. Over two days, he was having really high blood pressure, to the point he felt sick all the time so I took him to the hospital. Problem was that the office lady my step mom called for him that morning to say he wasn't well was out for most of the day and I didn't know she only contacted that one person. By the time I was taking my dad to the hospital, his boss and other office women were calling and texting me and him to figure out why he hasn't been working all day. His boss took this very personally even though it wasn't a personal thing.

Now that we are all locked in our homes, I have been trying to stand for myself. I don't just do whatever I am told, I make clear rules for my vechile(which is in my name, had been for two years). Well, a few days ago he was drunk and high, wanting to go to his friends house right aftet I got back from a shopping trip for groceries. I was pretty pissed because he was taking forever to get himself together to go only to cancel it because my step mom was upset he didn't bother to wake her up and ask her about her feelings on him leaving. So the next morning, when he was talking about wanting to do shopping the next morning, I said ""I do not mind helping, I just don't want anyone under the influence while in my vechile."" Before I could even explain more of it, he turned it into me saying he is day drinking. I did not say that, I just said a rule I want to enforce for my vechile. It turned into more of a fight because he decided to say I have no right to make choices in this house because ""he"" pays bills(my step mom is the only one working right now). I even told him that he was the one to tell me I need to stand up to him to gain respect but he just kept acting out at me. I get what I said could offend him but he also said he doesn't respect me because I don't respect myself which only pissed me off more because I would respect myself more if I was raised to think for myself and not just do as I am told.

Now, its been two days since this happened and he's still mad over it. Its to a point that now he's having to ask anyone else he can to take him out to get a few things for the house. All his friends want money to do it so he's now asking his parents. My step mom won't take him because she needs to work form home and he seems to have too much pride to just admit that my help is needed in this house and ask me to take him. I have never said I will not help, I've just made it clear there are rules in my vechile.

I do also want to point out that I'm not the only child here. I have a younger stepsister who pretty much gets allowed to do whatever she wants. They argue pretty often, to the point she is screaming at him yet he never tries to say anything to hurt her feelings but he will go straight to whatever shuts me up when I fight with him. He's only grown more selfish over time and I'm trying myself to figure out what would be best for my mental state because I can't handle being this depressed. I'm at a point where if it wasn't for my boyfriend, I don't think I'd be able to live anymore. I don't wanna get out my bed these days, I cry a lot, and I'm staying up as late as I can just so when I go to bed, I'll just pass out and not have to think. Its gotten so bad its affected my dreams, I'm seeing my dad being drunk and violent even though he's never actually hit me, it seems pretty clear he wants to because he can't control me anymore.

I'm just wondering if these are things other people experience with their parents after something tragic happens.

I suspect it is a defence meachanism where I never fully open myself and when a person has a problem with \*me\* they dont actually have a problem with \*me\* cause they never saw me, they saw themselves all along. I am a pretty distant person, I rarely open up, rarely initiate contact.  


There are people who also know the real me but they are like 2, 3 total, the rest see what I show them. I am also not afraid of rejection I take that pretty well, I guess I just want an easy exit of all situations.

Told my mom it was the last day for me, no response. She dosent even care. I remember her saying, ""if i was suicidal i wouldnt talk about it, i would just do it"". I want to end my life so bad.

35,raisedbynarcissists,2023-05-27 10:28:52,Reaper_of_Souls,"Six years ago, it was also a Saturday morning, and my Nmom died suddenly. I've been stuck taking care of my dad ever since, but that's about to change in a few months...","Because the majority of my student loan debt is off my credit report! I have a few ideas how this happened, but I guess I've ""aged out"" of the massive loan I took off 13 years ago (when we were rich for a hot minute and Nmom blew it adding onto/renovating The House Everything Happened In). I've been on disability except for brief periods of time ever since, knowing I'd never be able to afford a life where I wasn't dependent on other people.

My mom was likely an N (definitely histrionic) a worse alcoholic, and responsible for the majority of everything that went wrong in That House (a lot of the time she'd get us out of it, acting like she didn't create the whole damn thing in the first place). But she had a lot of legitimate gripes about my dad. The thing she didn't realize is that he just went along with the shit she said and she hadn't ""changed"" him (one of the strangest things she ever said was ""never EVER try to stop changing a person""... WTF?) She loved him, and she actually thought she'd gotten him to change, but the one thing she knew was that she could not make him love her back. He stayed with her, and enabled her, because he was too useless to do anything else.

The truth is, I did love my mom. My dad, not so much. But the issue with my mom was that the love was *unhealthy*. Still, I needed love from a parent, so I went after her. I wasn't exactly the GC (that was my older half sister, she didn't have a dad so my mom thought she had to love her twice as much?) but when I found myself being held with all the responsibility but none of the respect, I couldn't take it anymore. After a particularly bad incident when I was 24 I had to go VLC/NC for almost a year to save my own sanity.

In addition to his drinking, my dad is probably in the beginning of dementia at this point. Even if he's not, I know it's only gonna get worse from here with him. He's made it clear he doesn't want a relationship with me and I'm fine with that. I'm starting a family of my own now, my girlfriend has a 14 year old who I've known since she was born. Her father wasn't on the birth certificate and has since died, and if we have a kid together I don't know if he'll get to be the grandpa. But I certainly won't mistake the same mistake he did and treat the older kid who never had a father like she wasn't mine.

Right now I just have to pay off the few loans that ARE on my credit report, as well as my minimal credit card debt. So I'll be watching my score go up over the next few months. Maybe get another credit card so I can have another line of credit. Anyone have any tips on how to do this? Anything would be appreciated.

Thanks for reading, guys. I know my experience isn't gonna be everyone's, but I hope it resonates with some of you. I just needed to get this off my chest, because there's no one I can talk about this with and it's obviously weighing heavily on my mind.",1,3,3,1.0,0,,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/13t3vz2/six_years_ago_it_was_also_a_saturday_morning_and/,False,False
36,raisedbynarcissists,2023-05-27 10:04:56,MuscleMuseMuseum,I need some advice in how to break contact with NDad.,"After alot of troubling years, where he would just lovebomb my daughter and i didn't have the strength to truly confront him with stuff.. i decided that enough is enough.

I recently gave birth, he wasnt there.
He mentioned me a week prior he was going on a trip and oh well, he would miss his grandsons first week.
He didnt need to be on that trip, he could even easily have rescheduled. But priorities i guess.
His new gf comes first, even tho he always says i am his number 1.
He never asked, never cared for the whole pregnancy.
Now we had a rough start with the baby,
Which we needed to go back to the hospital and i stayed there a total of 6 days with all the fears and anxiety that came with it.

He is supposed to visit next sunday for daughters birthday,
But i am done. I dont want him here and holding him and gifting gifts to act like he cares.

Sadly, he think he truly cares about us.
Last time he cut contact with me two times over something silly. This was 8 years ago though.
But i cant forgive him, and i wont.

How do i bring this, say i dont want him in my or their lives anymore and also lower the risk of him acting like a madman.
He threatend me before, so i think he is going mad tbh.
I truly dont want him to visit my house.",1,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/13t3hvb/i_need_some_advice_in_how_to_break_contact_with/,False,False
37,raisedbynarcissists,2023-05-27 09:45:24,throwawaywasdd,my family is a lie,"Everything in my life is a lie, and I’m going to pour my heart out in what I’m about to confess. My memory is hazy, so some parts might be inconsistent and there might be missing pieces of information so please bear with me.  
  
I grew up in a chaotic household. Not a day went by when my father and my brothers would fight. It gets extreme to the point where the police had to get involved. I was a child then, and I knew my brothers resented my father, but I did not know the real reason why.  
  
Not until I turned twelve. I discovered my father messaging someone online if there were any available men he can fuck. It was a haze after that, I couldn’t focus in school and I would randomly burst into tears during class. Since my class teacher knew my aunt is a fellow teacher in school, she brought me to her. Needless to say, I told her everything and how it affected me. I harmed myself as a way to cope, and I had frequent suicidal thoughts.  
  
She told my father about it because my depression became worse each day. One day, my parents brought me to this secluded restaurant. My father talked to me privately, and I really expected him to come clean and tell me the truth- but of course he chose to lie. You know what excuse he gave me? “It was my friend using my account. It wasn’t me.”  
  
I knew he was lying, but I pretended to believe him because I was afraid of him and the consequences that would ensue if I choose to fight for the truth. I didn’t want to cause any more chaos. My depression continued and I still continued to harm myself because of this.  
  
Weeks later, he found out I was still harming myself.  
  
Instead of showing guilt and remorse for what he did- and what it did to me, he punished me for my feelings. He beat me up and threatened to ‘lock’ me up in a psychiatric ward since I had ‘lost my mind’. He knew he was the reason why I turned like this, and yet he could do that to me. I was made out to be the villain for being stuck and depressed of the painful truth.  
  
This happened six years ago, and just recently I came into his office and looked into his laptop with the intent of gathering evidence of him cheating. What I’ll do with the evidence, I’ll just figure it out in the future. Of course, he was still fucking other guys.  
  
One of the conversations went like this:  
  
guy: “Let me come over, I’ll just pretend to be a masseur hehe”  
  
dad: “Next time, it’s too risky right now. I’m dead if I get caught.”  
  
In relation to this conversation, my brother caught my father doing a blowjob signal to two guys who came into our home.  
  
In another conversation my father said. “Don’t come early, my kids are still awake.”  
  
I just don’t get it. How can someone be so fucking shameless? How does he get to be successful and act innocent while my brothers are suffering from the truth? All these lies, all these manipulations, pretending that we are an ordinary family- I’m fucking tired of it all. There are still a lot of shit I couldn’t cover- my energy is drained writing all of this, and remembering it is painful.",2,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/13t36as/my_family_is_a_lie/,False,False
