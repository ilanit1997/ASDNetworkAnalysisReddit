86,HomeImprovement,2022-11-02 00:38:10,MyBrainsPOV,"New metal roof. Do I keep the ""left overs"" for future repairs?","I just got a new metal roof installed. About $34k. Today the project rep reached out to me and wanted to know if I wanted to keep the leftover metal panels. It's 26g charcoal colored standing seam panels. There are 8 left over, over 22 feet long each. I have a quarter acre lot, no barn; basically I have no idea where I'd put these. But it feels wasteful and I wonder if I'll regret it later if I take him up on his offer to cut them up for the dumpster. My question is essentially how expensive might this decision be down the road if I say ""get rid of it"". That's where I'm at realistically because where do I store that kind of material for years and years on a quarter acre lot? I dont want to look like a junk yard. 

&#x200B;

But on the other hand what if we get a crazy hail storm in 2 years and they no longer make my exact shade or style of panel? I'm hoping some of you have some real world experience that can help us make this decision. I've played with the idea of laying them down along one side of fence and building a sitting bench over and around them but truth be told that's a further waste of money and no one wants to sit against a fence in Florida (lizards, bugs, squirrels, etc). Maybe I can somehow get them into my attic and that wouldnt be so bad. But is it worth it? And if I did that and need a repair in 5 years and my attic stored panels are like brand new and my roof panels have 5 years of weather and sun will that be any better than mismatched panels bought down the road?",123,49,49,0.91,0,,/r/HomeImprovement/comments/yjqjf8/new_metal_roof_do_i_keep_the_left_overs_for/,False,True

He told us he'd charge $1,600 for one and $1,700 for the other (includes the mini-splits, hardware, and labor). I'm nervous that this may be overkill for what we want for our bedroom so I wanted to ask here hoping I might save us from a mistake. Our bedroom is on the opposite end of the house as the 3 ton air handler and we often feel a little too warm in our room at night. I assume its because we close our door and are so far away from the AC. We do have a small fan over our bed and my wife wants to change that out but I'm worried we spend $500+ to upgrade the fan and are still warm blowing warm air around and end up going with a mini-split after that. In the other hand, I'm nervous we install this mini-split and it's always too cold in there lol. Please let me know if one is a better idea than the other; if there's an option I am unaware of, and thank you very much for your time. (the other mini-split is pretty much a definite go.

Or save and hire it out?,"We (24F & 25M) bought our first home in April 2022. It was built in 1949 and was added on to by the only previous owner a few times. The husband was a woodworker so I suspect he did a lot of it - but it is done very well. 

He did choose to do a drop ceiling with white, old-school, asbestos looking, school type tiles in the den. Which I hate. A lot. Lol! I’ve done some research and it looks like at least the wiring/plumbing? is recommended to be hired out. We have little experience with wiring / plumbing but have done a handful of DIY project fixing up our home since the purchase and are wondering how much of changing this ceiling is feasible for us to do ourselves. 

It looks like drywall is what a “normal” ceiling is and what we’d need to replace it with. Are there other options y’all can recommend?

Would you take on changing this yourself? 

Would you hire it out? 
Parts or the entirety?

We are in Oklahoma and the room is about 180 sq. feet roughly. 

How much do you think DIY would cost? Hiring out? Google says about $16 a sq. ft. on average for hiring out.

What now?,"I am not sure if anyone has had to deal with shoddy contractors, but I am unsure of what to do next. I hired a liscenced recommended company to install a new AC in December. Today, they just ""finished"" the job (had to order parts/doghouse). 

The term finished is a joke as it looks worse than the 20 year old ac they replaced. Like the previous unit, it is all in one with everything completely outside.

Issues
1. The dog house is barely connected to the house. Screws falling out of siding and can place a hand between the metal covering the tubing and the house for almost the entire connection 
2. The platform they placed to hold the unit was moved today. Most of it is not even touching the ground and if I stand on it, it moves.
3. 1 chord is extremely taunt and already falling out of ac/house. 

Bonus, they left trash all over my yard and I found my dogs chewing on metal pieces. 

I have no idea what to do next. Everytime I call, they tell me what I want to hear, but nothing changes. I have no money and I don't see that ac lasting as is for long in FL between storms and always running.

My front gate was mounted on a slightly incline and recenlty it's having issues opening in the uphills direction. I did some research and disassembled the gate, it seems like the motor was having trouble moving up the hill and it sometimes trigger the safety alarm. The main board seems okay with all the lights and everything. I had two companies came over to check it, they quoted $4500 to fix the motor and mainboard which seems a little overpriced.

I found the motor (Liftmaster K76-36398 1/2HP Motor (24VDC) Replacement Kit CSW24V & CSL24V Gate) which cost $600. I don't know which seller I should buy it from since i know if there's anything wrong with the product the restocking fee and mailing fee would be very expensive.

I want to know if there's an official place to get it because it doesn't appears to be on their website.  And if it's possible to use another similar motor instead?

We have several sliding doors and windows our house. 

They are some custom aluminum frames built back in '94.

Some of them are sticky / screeching when we open them so i throught i should give it a try and replace the rollers and perhaps the brushes all around. (they charge about $50 per door, so why not)

I managed to loosen the whole thing and remove it from the rails (rails? - anyway). So now i am looking under it and i cannot figure out how to reach the roller assembly.

I am afraid that if i start unscrewing the screws all around, the whole thing will come off and ill have to refit the glasses.

I have taken several pictures so maybe someone can give me some pointers?

I also cannot figure out the brand - to maybe find some schematic, so i have a close up pic of the logo (looks like a B or 8, idk)

Here are the pictures of the logo, the roller assembly and the side of the aluminum frame.

During the inspection i smelled dirty sock in one of the rooms if you kept the door close.

But if you leave it open the smell goes away. This was when the HVAC is off already.

When I google dirty sock smell in house people refer to mold in HVAC system.

1) The HVAC system in that room is completely changed (brand new interior and exterior units). Also asked the HVAC technician if vents need cleaning or have any mold. He said not needed.

2) I called mold specialist. He said he doesn't smell any mold in the room.

Now the smell only comes back under these circumstances:

1) If i turn off the AC for like 3-6 hours including it's fan.
2) If AC's running only on fan mode and I take a shower in the nearby room with doors open (this room that smells has the interior AC unit, so all the air is sucked into this room)

I feel this smell comes back only when the room gets humid. What could that be? And also my nose just gets used to it pretty quickly like 30-60 seconds later I don't even smell it at all.
