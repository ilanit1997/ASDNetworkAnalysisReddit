But a quick Google search says that Mendel only published his works on inheritance in 1966, 7 years after Darwin's book was published, and DNA was only discovered in 1869. I find it very unlikely that he'd be able to use the term ""genetic"" in the same sense as us.

It is my understanding that volcanic eruptions can cause a VERY slight cooling effect on the earth because of the chemicals they shoot into the atmosphere and the amounts of them. But I’m wondering about something a little more abstract. 

If the surface temperature of the earth is increasing, even slightly, due to the many factors that contribute to it, would the core of the earth also be increasing in heat? If so, Is there any way to know what 1 degree Celsius increase of surface temp would equate to in terms of the core of the earths temperature rising? Or is this concept fundamentally wrong?

If it’s not wrong, could an increase in the earths core temperature increase the frequency of volcanic eruptions, ultimately leading to more global “cooling” due to the effect of volcanic eruptions?",10,12,12,0.67,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13qjd4d')>,,/r/askscience/comments/13qjd4d/volcanic_eruptions_global_warming_and_global/,,,False,False

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field.
