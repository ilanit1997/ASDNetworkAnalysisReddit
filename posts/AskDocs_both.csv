I’m 24, AFAB, 5’5” and 230lbs. No physical prior conditions, but I’m diagnosed with Depression, Anxiety, and ADHD. I’m taking the Lamictal as a mood stabilizer for my Depression.

For medications, I’m currently on 10mg methylphenidate IR, 27mg methylphenidate ER, and my doctor is working with me to swap me from 20mg Fluoxetine to 20mg of Lamictal. I also take a combined birth control pill (Blisovi/Tarina FE 1/20). 

From my psych, I was told that the interaction between the bc and Lamictal would be minimal. From my doctor at Planned Parenthood, I was told that Lamictal can interfere with bc and make it less effective, and that I should use backup protection. From my pharmacist, I was told that my bc would be unaffected, but that I should take my Lamictal a few hours after my bc, because the estrogen would cause me to metabolize the Lamictal more quickly and I wouldn’t get the full effects. 

I’ve tried to look around online, but everything I read has a different conclusion about the interaction. I’m mostly concerned about my bc impacting my Lamictal, and was wondering if anyone had any more insight on medication timing.",2,2,2,1.0,0,,/r/AskDocs/comments/127zd43/lamictal_and_combined_birth_control/,False,True

I discovered a bump on my cervix in 2019 and told my gynecologist, they said they can't see anything. I was diagnosed with HPV and genital warts in 2018, warts were removed via laser surgery.  When I told my gynecologist about my symptoms in 2020 they gave me the pill and didn't order any tests except the yearly pap smear and an ultrasound. In 2021 I went and asked again because my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, her father later died of stomach cancer. The symptoms, especially the pelvic pain, have gotten worse and the bump on my cervix got bigger. But still my gynecologist tells me I'm just constipated and I should get back on birth control (i stopped taking the pill in November 2022) The pain is always there, sometimes only light, sometimes very bad, pain meds don't help. My GP tested me for bladder infection, test came back negative. The intermenstrual bleeding lasts for 2-3 days, no period pain, only the ""normal"" one, no PMS, no symptoms of ovulation before the bleeding. I'm frustrated no doctor wants to listen to me.

1971,AskDocs,2023-04-03 04:16:46,introvertedfreak21,Is this a panic attack?,"Hello, I'm a 25F that weighs 230lbs and is 5ft tall. Currently I have arthritis in my hands, scoliosis in the shape of a backwards S so my right hand goes numb if I stress it and I have one hip slightly higher than the other so it makes one leg seem longer than the other. I do have bad allergies that cause frequent headaches behind my eyes. I take generic benadryl, generic zoloft, and a antacid that starts with an L; I know it's long lasting. I was also diagnosed anxiety but I thought it was more manageable.

So, sometime early 2021, I believe I had my first panic attack. I had been working 12hr shifts five days a week, learning on living on my own with my roommate and boyfriend, and lost my car maybe a month prior. I worked at a warehouse in GA that had no AC; I was given this large order that I hated doing. While I worked on the order, I had this creeping feeling of struggling to breath. I just kept ignoring it but it was getting worse. I ran into my boyfriend at work and it just spilled out of me, I started crying and was struggling to breath. I wasn't in a state to keep operating the machine we used to move around the warehouse. After that time, I started taking Zoloft.

I've been doing better but lately I feel like it's coming back. I had a panic attack at my job today, I currently work in retail and yesterday was super busy and even though I only have a 5 hour shift today, the nonstop growing line caused this feeling of struggling to breath. I called one of the managers over and asked her to take over for me while I take a minute to breath. I went to the family bathroom we have as it was the only private one. I broke down, I was crying and hyperventilating. I didn't feel like anything was mentally, I just couldn't get a grip on my body. I'm just wondering if this sounds like a panic attack. I still have this tight feeling in my throat. I do have Hydroxine to help prevent panic attacks but I don't feel it's strong enough. I can't start therapy yet because I go off my parents health insurance this year and I can't afford to get my own at the moment.

Sex Male

Race White

Duration of complaint About two months

Location Whole body

Any existing relevant medical issues Quarter size whole in his heart

Current medications None

So I'm asking this for him because he refuses to go to doctors for fear of being charged a lot of money, yay usa healthcare....

He has a quartar sized hole in his heart which causes low blood pressure to a healthy degree. Its not enough to make him easily weak when standing or have any issues like that. However when he got covid back in December 2021, he's been having this issue where he will stretch really hard while standing and right as he does, he just suddenly falls on the floor. He's still awake and responsive but he needs a minute or two before he can stand back up. It was something that only happened maybe once a month but its starting to become more frequent after he had covid. I also got covid form him but all I've experienced since then is a lot of mucus production and congestion, neither which he has to my knowledge. He doesn't drink, smoke, or do any drugs. He doesn't take any prescription meds regularly either. His diet isn't the best, I'm working on getting us both to eat more vegatablss and less red meat. Any advice or suggestions would be helpful, I'm not really sure how to describe what happens to him in a way I can research it since its like fainting but he's still responsive and aware, just his body loses all energy in a brief moment.

1992,AskDocs,2021-08-30 02:51:18,introvertedfreak21,Athlete's foot or something else?,"I've noticed some pretty bad heel cracking on my feet closer to my toes. I did take some pics but I can't post them on here. I thought they were form me not scrapping dry skin off my feet that would fall off. One time I tried to pull at some of this skin and found that very painful, like ten times worse than a bad hangnail. My step mom suggested it was bad athlete's foot so I bought some cream form Walgreen's for Athlete's foot. It says it is clotrimazole cream and I am not sure if I should use it daily but I've used it almost weekly. The cracking hasn't gotten better. I forget about it a lot, to be honest. I also take Zoloft for Anxiety, Birth control, and Naproxen 500mg for my back though I'm working to get off of that and may see a spine specialist soon. I was worried that maybe this was actually some other health concern as Athlete's foot is just one of many reasons why my heels are cracking. There is also a lot of peeling skin around my pinky toe(the smallest one), that hasn't been as bad as the cracks though.

Detailed Edit:

I am a 24F.
Height: 5ft 0in
Weight: 250lbs
Race: White
Complaint: Heel Cracking
Duration: Not sure, at least a year
Existing Medical Issues: Scoliosis, Anxiety, Degenerating disc between my tailbone and spine.
Current Medication: Zoloft 25mg, Naproxen 500mg, Norethindrone .35mg
I don't smoke, I only drink once or twice a month, no other drugs

I hope this helps. The cream I use is white so I thought it would help to show the cracks in the heels.

1993,AskDocs,2021-08-16 23:19:55,introvertedfreak21,Physical Anxiety Issue?,"So, I am a 24 female, I am 5ft tall and weigh at 250lbs. I know I am overweight, I've been working on calorie counting to help slowly lose weight. I currently take Naproxen 500mg, birth control, and acid reducer. I also have scoliosis which was what the Naproxen is meant to help with.

A little background, I work at a warehouse. Due to the pandamic, we are short staffed and I live in a right to work state. They make us do 12hr shifts almost every day and make us come in for a sixth day every third week. At the time, I had worked one 10 and a half shift, and two 12 shifts. It wasn't the first time I did that and in the heat of summer, I'd been working at that job for over a year now. My only idea of what stressed me out was the job in combination of my boyfriend buying a motorcycle and having been in an accident that previous Friday. He's fine, just bad roadrash but it still scared me.

Last Wednesday, I had what I was told was a panic attack. I had felt this tight feeling in my throat, like a ball had formed there. It got worse and worse, making it harder and harder to breathe. It got a point where I felt like I was drowning. I had ran into my boyfriend and that's when it all just overtook me, I started wheezing and was struggling not to cry. I refused 911 because I could talk and I could calm down but not enough to be breathing normally. It was a struggle to talk. My step mom came and got me from work. She gave me two options, I could go with her to the liquor store and she would buy me a few drinks or I could take half a xanax(she had a prescription for these). I took the xanax because I don't really like drinking alcohol much. After I took the medicine, she bought me some food, and in the maybe 20mins form when she got me, got food, and took me to my house, the xanax kicked in and I never felt so relaxed before. I never knew how much tense I really held in my body, no other meds I took helped me relax my muscles so well and it made me question so much of what doctors told me.

I had been told because of my back, one leg would always be tenser and never relax as well as the other leg did. I took meds to relax my muscles so I wouldn't be in pain. Everything else made the pain mild enough that I could ignore it. Xanax wiped that pain out completely, my muscles fully relaxed for the first time in forever. The next day I was off of work and I could feel how much it hurt to have that medicine out of my system. I mainly stayed home that day as it hurt a lot to walk around. I wanted to think maybe my legs were tired because I had worked an 8 and a half hour shift before my panic attack. The next two days after, I was just pretty sore but managed fine. The Sunday morning was different, I had to work that morning. I could feel that tight feeling in my throat again so I thought it wouldn't hurt to take just half a xanax before work. It was the best I was able to work ever. Nothing hurt, I did feel mildly sleepy but it was no worse than my usual tired(I had to wake up at 6:45 that morning), the sleepy feeling went away with time but I could move with no pain. My fingers didn't hurt form folding tons of shirts, my feet didn't ache form standing all day, and I was just able to move fine. I worked 12hrs that day and I didn't start hurting till the last hour of my shift.

With all that in mind, I decided that I needed to search out therapy. I set up with an online therapy service that my insurance mostly covers. Today I woke up with my shoulders aching all day and just feeling weak. I was ready to just get this appointment over with so I could get some answers. The video call was set up, I waited 20mins for the therapist. Watched this little thing say she was unavailable then online then back to offline. I was later told that I missed the appointment somehow and that I had to reschedule. I was mad because I sat in such an anxious state waiting for this. I felt like I'd throw up and was shaking. I set up another appointment and sent an email about what happened to the support team. I decided to just give it a try of half a xanax again and a hot shower. The pain in my shoulders went away, I was able to breath normally, and no longer felt nauseous. I do have another appointment set up next Friday but I just want some advice on if this sounds like something else. I always avoided medicine like Xanax or strong pain killers because my mom was an addict who died of an overdose and my father isn't much better, he would only mix xanax with some alcohol which I know is the number one thing recommended not to do.",2,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/AskDocs/comments/p5roem/physical_anxiety_issue/,False,True

I'm a 21 year old female that stands at 5 feet tall and currently weighing at 188lbs. About two months ago I went to my doctor about pain in my right hip only to find out I was weighing at 202lbs and had scoliosis to where my lower back is curved to the left and my tailbone is slightly misplaced, its still connected but it doesn't look to be perfectly connected. After some antiinflammatory medicine, the pain went away and my doctor put me on a diet pill to curve my appetite which has helped me to lose 14lbs so far. My last visit I asked for a copy of my x-rays, something I should've asked for sooner, I know. I had forgotten they took x-rays of my hips as well as my lower back and noticed that my hips seemed too narrow for a female set of hips and when showing it to a friend and my father, both agreed to them seeming narrow and my pelvis is very thin, thin enough that having a child would most likely shatter it. I have another appointment coming up on the 31st of May to see my weight loss going so I was gonna talk to my doctor about the oddities of my hips and if I should see a specialist about my spine since my back and shoulders are popping a lot and my muscles get so tense that I can't pop anything and become really painful which isn't good since I work at a warehouse that sells clothes so I need to use my back. I have gotten clearance to lift up to 50 pounds which is the weight listed in the guidelines of my job but nothing more than that. But my main concern is if there may be something worse than just my spine being curved wrong and if I should ask for further x-rays of my spine and hips.",1,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/AskDocs/comments/btqqmt/can_scoliosis_lead_to_misformed_hip_bones/,False,True

For the past year however I've been feeling my heart flip flop in my chest at random times, on average once a week. I sometimes get shortness of breath at the same time. 

I've already asked both my GP and a hospital doctor but they both said that it doesn't sound like I'm having palpitations because according to them that's only skipping a beat... Admittedly I do have PTSD and anxiety so I may not have been explaining right in person. And I don't recall feeling any symptoms of either PTSD or anxiety when the flip flopping happens. 

Should I press for further investigation by a specialist? I do have to admit that I am worried that the anxiety etc and my body weight will continually put stress on my heart. Both of which I am treating. Though the body weight is a bit complicated by an eating disorder, so please assume I understand any advice regarding weight and do not need to hear it since the psychological aspect is more important right now.

I started to have PVCs a year ago. Had a clear echo, EKG and stress test in December. Since then, I'm learning how to live with the health anxiety PVCs have caused me. Recently though, I began to feel PVCs during exercise. It's important to say that I haven't exercised in at least 8 months because of health anxiety. Also due to COVID-19, I spent these past months at home and did not move around a lot. 

I have a good diet and normal blood work. I noticed my PVCs don't have anything to do with the intensity of exercise. I can run 15 minutes on a 160bpm and I don't feel anything, but if I walk 30 minutes on a lower heart rate I might get one or two PVCs. I can ride the bike very fast for 30 minutes to 1 hour until I start to get some PVCs. Usually it's when I'm doing the exercise for a long time that they occur. It also doesn't have anything to do with my heart beating faster because I feel nothing when I work out hard. 

I am really worried about it. Other than that I have no symptoms at all that could indicate CAD or heart failure or something like that. I am quite reluctant to get another stress test because last time I had a panic attack on the treadmill and the doctor wasn't so nice. As I said, I haven't exercised due to health anxiety and my heart beating faster still gets me anxious and sets me into a panic attack sometimes. I don't feel ready to have one again so I'm looking for advice or reassurance. What could this be?

A week ago I (47M) passed out during bloodwork where a nerve was touched. Had never happened to me before. Lost feeling in my hands during and after the short episode. Numbness and tingling then spread over my whole body after a couple days. I now have all the symptoms described as a MS attack/flare-up (numbness, tingling, dizziness, sweating without a fever). My BP and HR have shot up as well. Came on very quickly.

My understanding is time is critical for treatment for first attack if this really is MS. I’ve gone to ER (bloodwork and CT were clear) and been referred to a neurologist but that appointment could take weeks. I’m talking with my general practitioner on Monday where I plan on asking for an MRI asap.

Could you see this kind of reaction just from hitting a nerve during bloodwork? If so, could it take months to resolve?

Please Help I've Lost 6 Kilograms","Hi, i'm a 18M and have been having severe nausea for 20 days and vomiting frequently every day. I also have lack of appetite, weight loss and a weird mild pain on my lower-right abdomen. I've been to many doctors and went through many tests and scans but nothing could find the reason of it. 

I've been to these doctors: Internist, GP, Gastroenterologist, Psychiatrist, General Surgeon, Urologist. 

I've had these things done: Bloodwork 5 times, Urine analysis, Stool culture, Xrays, Ultrasound, CT, Endoscopy. Everything came out clean, there was not a single problem. 

I've been using fluoxetine for 6 months and olanzapine for a month for my anxiety disorder. I had quit olanzapine for about a week in the beginning of May and my problem began a week after this. I informed my psychiatrist about this and we got on olanzapine again but nothing improved after 2 weeks. 

Important things: I can't sit down because i get very nauseous and begin burping frequently but it gets better when i lay down on my bed. I can stand up but i still feel nauseous and have to lay down again quickly. My symptoms get better for a few hours when i talk a long walk outside.  

I've lost 6+ kilograms in 20 days and yesterday i could eat dinner for the first time since the beginning of my illness but it was with the help of walking a long distance for a few hours outside. 

I have a very mild pain in my lower right abdomen, 45 degrees diagonal - below my belly button.

I don't know what to do anymore, i'm just suffering from this. I have a big exam in less than a month but my psychology is quite fine against it, i don't feel anxious at all and i'm relaxed. I feel like i won't be able to recover from this unknown thing :(

Please help, what this can be? I've just rushed to the bathroom while trying to write this after sitting on my chair to use my computer :( This sucks!",1,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/AskDocs/comments/13t4fp1/unexplained_nausea_and_vomiting_tests_and_scans/,False,False

This is so weird, but up until two years ago, I used to be the best water drinker. Multiple bottles a day. I don’t know what switched up, but now I can go two-three days without needing to drink anything. My diet isn’t the best so I don’t think I’d be getting all of my water from it. I know that’s not healthy, but it’s so hard to keep on it when my body doesn’t give me thirst cues. I get hunger cues just fine lol. My A1C is fine and I get other blood work done. The only things I have wrong are low vitamin D and hypothyroid (hashimoto) that I’m working on. Why is this? I am a female, 22. I take levothyroxine.

Recently I have been having an issue with getting tired. Its not that I am tired and cant fall asleep, its that I just don't get tired. If I try and fall asleep, even with no death scrolling or electronic stimulus, just reading, I just lay in bed for hours. 

In the past 48 hours, I went to bed at 8 Am, after being up all night, woke up at 4 PM. Then stayed up all night to 10 AM!, slept for 4 hours, woke up via alarm at 2 PM for work, worked from 3PM to 12 AM, and I've been up since, on 4 hours of sleep, after a long physical day at work where I am on my feet all day. Again, its not that I'm tired and I cant fall asleep, I just don't feel tired at all, its starting to effect my schedule because I am asleep or awake at ridiculous times. Its now getting on to 7am my time, ive been up since 2PM the previous day on just 4 hours, and again, If i tried to lay in bed right now i would just lie awake, not fatigued or tired at all.

When I do fall asleep, I sleep like a rock, I get good quality sleep, and always wake up feeling rested, and when I do sleep I sleep for a normal amount of time, just at abnormal times, after being up for abnormally long.

Is this just a weird form of insomnia? should I do a sleep study? This isnt a serious medical issue but I just would like some advice or to know what my next steps should be If i cant regain control of my sleep scheduel",1,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/AskDocs/comments/13t4b52/im_not_getting_tired/,False,False

30/F 
Height: 5ft 6 
Weight: 80kg 
Medication: Lisdexamfetamine 

I am a dentist and it’s well known dentists have high levels of depression/substance abuse/burn out due to stress. 

I am no exception (except the substance abuse part lol). I have been experiencing incredibly low mood. Crying randomly. And mood swings which come across as irritable, but then I start crying :(, and beyond fatigued. I feel like I am running on empty.

I know in part it’s due to me not being happy in my job, and that will be changing by September so that’s good  but I also recently found out my Vitamin D levels are crazy low. 

I was wondering if you think that low vit d can contribute to my low mood? 

A quick google says yes but honestly a lot of these sites are run by holistic tree hugging homeopathic loving donuts so I take it with a pinch of salt as I think any of these sites will say any deficiency will cause low mood. 

My critical brain says yea it’s contributing to my mood, however part of me thinks, I am just burnt out and need a holiday. 

If I sort my vit d levels out how long does it take to see an improvement? 

Any input appreciated 

Ty in advance.",1,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/AskDocs/comments/13t47ik/30f_vit_d_deficiency_and_low_mood_correlation/,False,False

However I wanted advice on how slow/fast to take things. I’ve been unwell for months with reduced mobility however I’ve really been starting to feel better since being on the Brucella antibiotics.

One ended in a miscarriage, the second was a healthy full term pregnancy, and the third was a premature delivery via c section at 24 weeks. Lately I’m noticing that I’m dealing with depression symptoms the week after my period ends. I feel very low energy and I have low motivation. I generally feel apathetic and it seems to last for a week and then I start to feel like myself again. It’s been happening for about 6 months that I feel this way the week after my period ends.
