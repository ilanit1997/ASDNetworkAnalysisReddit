I'm female and, although I know it's much more nuanced than this, almost all people with a Y chromosome are going to be physically stronger than me by default. If I spent time training, I would improve, but due to the hand I was dealt at birth I would still pale in comparison to people who are, by default, stronger and taller than me.

I also have a disability. It doesn't bother me most of the time, but sometimes it really hits me that this is permanent. No cure. This is my body for the rest of my life.

Life isn't a video game where you get advantages that weigh out the disadvantages. I know I'm much more fortunate than others in some ways, but most of them are social, not biological.

In my liberal arts classes I've been told to use the term ""Latinx"" to refer to that community, but all of my Latino friends say to use ""Latino"" and view ""Latinx"" as whitewashing/lite colonialism. Also with cultural appropriation, people often have different ideas on what does or does not constitute misuse of their culture. There are examples for all groups--people making stances on behalf of a group on what is, or is not, deemed acceptable.
