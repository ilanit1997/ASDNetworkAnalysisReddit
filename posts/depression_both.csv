I am 4-6 weeks into brintellix for depression (I'm on venlafaxin for anxiety). Started at 10mg, about 2 weeks ago felt increased depression and anxiety and I increased my dose to 20mg (my doctor said that would be ok). I know it is supposed to take weeks if not months to feel a difference, but every day has been filled with dread, constant self hate, low energy, bad mood, and just wanting to end my life. If anything depression is worse than before and have even less energy to fight.

On top of that, I have gained 20lbs since started brintellix, and I worry if I don't stop this medication then I will be depressed and overweight. I can feel myself having a strong negative mental reaction to being overweight, which I think in itself is something to understand (why do I feel this way?).

37,depression,2022-11-15 09:16:53,luna_bea_tuna,Visualized tools for depression,"Hi - I suffer from anxiety and depression and take medication for both, and am in therapy to articulate the way I feel, have someone challenge or validate feelings, and learn tools to use on a daily basis to help myself when I am feeling deep sadness, hopelessness or purposelessness. 

What I haven't been able to do is really take anything I learn in therapy to help myself outside of the 24hr window after therapy. My brain is so fuzzy that I struggle to remember the tools I have learned and it feels like I haven't grown at all and am in the same spot as years ago. So I get caught in the whirlwind and spin out.

I started watching (haven't finished) the Jonah Hill netflix special about his therapist, who uses some drawing/visualization techniques (in the therapy session at least) and I felt inspired. I am thinking of having physical things to remind me of different tools to use - either like actual objects/jewelry or drawing/non-permanent tattoo/stickers. 

So for reddit I ask this:

1. What are your ''tools'' / techniques for working through feelings in the moment?
2. Do you have any physical/visualized objects/techniques to remind yourself? Or if not, how do you remember them? Or jolt yourself out of a moment to remember that you even have tools?

I expect not every technique works for everyone, and that everyone struggles with different depression and anxiety challenges, but I appreciate any shared thoughts.

I never look forward to being with her. Our relationship and fights are what pushes me into depression, though I’m sure I would be miserable anyway. We have tried couples therapy and I think we need more help but she doesn’t want to go to more. I really want a divorce.

But wait! We have a 3 year old, and both live abroad temporarily and both come from different countries. So if we split up, there’s no clear way we can both be with our child unless we continue living abroad, which I know she will not want. And maybe we can’t afford to live apart either. Neat!

There’s no future I can imagine where I will be happy. Either stay in a shit marriage for the kid, or divorce and maybe fuck up their life because probably I wont be around since I wont be able to live in the same country.

My fiancé and I are both disabled, mainly in huge part to our mental health. But these past couple months we’ve had some positive changes happening around our life and more to come. Mainly along the lines of finally being able to make a more accommodating apartment space that could potentially help us a whole lot with daily functioning. 

I know during the Winter people tend to feel depression symptoms going up. But I don’t know if it’s just that for me. Because every time I have things going on, I think about people that aren’t around in my life anymore and it just pushes me further into depression. 

My father walked out on me as a teen and I often think where he is in life and when I have things going on, what he would think of me. My grandmother passed away 4 years ago, before I had any semblance of stability and so I often wish I could share this life I’ve been building with her. I think about friends that just aren’t around. And more recently having to distance myself from the rest of my family, and so I think a lot about how I can’t share any of my life with them. For my own sanity, trust me, it’s best not to. 

I’m also neurodivergent and I struggle immensely with building relationships and making friends. So when I have a lot of changes happening, it quickly feels isolating and lonely because I genuinely don’t have anyone I can share it with. I’m part of a small community on Instagram, and a lot of my internet friends are always happy to hear what’s going on, but it’s more of passing updates. It’s never full conversations about my life or theirs. Not anymore. All the friends I used to have that used to know everything about my life, don’t want to be in my life anymore. 

Idk. It sucks sometimes looking back at all the work you’re doing (therapy and otherwise) and realizing you can still wake up and feel like nothing matters.",0,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/depression/comments/1022fut/is_it_winter_blues_or_just_my_life/,False,True

At one point over initial pandemic my depression got pretty bad. I was basically showering once a week, IF that. It was so hard to feel any motivation to for reasons on top of my depression. 

What I wasn’t expecting though is that in that time I was going to create more problems for myself later. I’ve always struggled on and off with dry scalp and dandruff. I’ve changed my shampoo and shampooing routine more times than I can count. It didn’t occur to me that not showering often enough for an extended period was going to cause extremely stubborn build up on my scalp. 

At this point it’s led to my hair falling out. And the worst part is it’s BARELY motivating me to wash it more frequently. I’ve switched to more natural products and have bought this specific scalp scrubber, and also have been doing oil treatments. I think I’d be seeing quicker progress if I could stick to being consistent with it. I even cut off all my hair to make things easier. 

It just sucks. It brings up feelings of me being a failure in some way because there’s this awful in my face physical evidence that I can’t take care of myself well enough.

Hey everyone, I'm 27, in college, and I have major depressive disorder, PTSD, and anxiety disorder. 5 years ago, I was able to hold a job, I was in college, and I had stability. I decided to quit work, and my wife and I went to school together. 
I'm still in school, after failing a few classes and being unable to keep up with the course work, I tried to calm the school thing down and go part time and work part time. Well, 5 jobs this year and I haven't managed to keep a hold of one for over a month. I have panic attacks that are so bad that I faint or throw up. And it's just over leaving the house. I've tried to relax, tried to find outlets with friends and I can't even manage that these days. My wife is super supportive, and kind. She understands, but I feel like I'm letting her down by failing so much at what I set out to do. I'm an artist, and haven't even sat down to paint or draw in months. 
This decline has happened over the course of a year, I'm feeling worse and worse about myself, I'm terrified I'm going to lose financial aid, and that we'll be homeless. I feel so hopeless and worthless.
I don't have insurance, and there's no counselor or therapist that's free out here that's equipped to handle someone like me, I've tried the only free resource out here. 
I genuinely don't know what started this decline in my mental state. Idk if it's just childhood trauma coming to a head, if that's the case why it started now, or how to even get out of it. I need advice and resources to resolve this...

i was referred to a local mental health team but it has been months and it is so difficult to talk to anyone. they call me and either i miss the call or i'm really not prepared for the call so i don't answer. i call back and they are either engaged or i speak to a receptionist and nobody is available and they will call me back but it takes hours and i do not feel like talking at that point. i asked if i could communicate with them via email but apparently the receptionist can't give out any emails because the person who has the email address would have to agree. i was thinking of writing a letter but i'm worried they will just tell me to call. i am okay with appointments where i have to see someone because i see that as a situation where i have to be in a room and at least something will happen (and i have practiced this way of thinking with seeing the doctor and it has worked. i am still polite and don't say how bad things really are but i have written things down and have spoken more than i ever have - but my doctor changed and my new doctor has basically referred me to this mental health team and said they are just their for medication reviews so the one place i started to feel relatively comfortable talking feels closed off).

i've asked family for support but again, talking isn't so great  so i emailed and they haven't mentioned anything to me. it has been a week. i'm not sure what to do. my work doesn't make me feel so good and i have had interview dates for a few new jobs but i can't bring myself to go and cancel and i'm closing doors that maybe could make things a bit better and i don't want to but i think not having the interviews is better than turning up and having a rough time at the moment as it will sink my mood even more.

the sinking down to a very low place is in progress and i'm aware my reaction to this is becoming progressively worse. i'm not sure what the point of this post is but i guess it is just nice to be able to say it somewhere.",0,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/depression/comments/118gcsa/feeling_kind_of_bad_lately/,False,True
2454,depression,2022-07-31 00:49:36,HofmansHuffy,I don’t feel real anymore.,"The last several months I’ve become increasingly certain that I am autistic. I identify with nearly every common trait attributed to ASD. I think I can afford to get properly diagnosed, but I’m afraid of the result not being what I expect. If I don’t get a diagnosis, I’m going to feel like an imposter. Maybe I am just making everything up in my head. I have a long history of over analyzing everything and getting ahead of myself. If I’m not autistic that means that the mystery of why I am the way that I am is simply because I’m a chemically unbalanced loon. 

Conversely, if I do get an ASD diagnosis, how is everyone around me going to treat me? Would I even tell them? They could see me as even more of an ultra-sensitive basket case. What if it makes them uncomfortable to be my friend? Or maybe they choose to believe I’m lying. I’ve tried explaining the similarities I’ve found with myself and ASD and some friends have flat out said “even if you are, you can’t blame everything on autism”. I’m not trying to.

People look at me and they see a “pretty”girl and assume that I have a lot of friends and things going for me. But the truth is…is that I have no friends and no romantic relationships. And I struggle to connect with other people because of my mental health issues.

This is going to be a brutally honest post, just warning you If you are easily triggered. It’s very possible I will likely delete this post eventually because it’s perhaps too honest and revealing.

As I child, I had many learning disabilities. My parents hired a tutor who was an older man to help me at school. When I was 9 or 10 years old, I was raped by him. He eventually killed himself years later. I didn’t even know how to process what happened and it didn’t start to effect me until I got older. 

I have struggled with severe depression consistently since I was 15. When in the summer of 2011, my Grandmother who I loved very much, passed away. My girlfriend at the time broke up with me and my older cousin whom I loved since childhood like an older brother stopped talking to me after he went to college.

Since then, going into my twenties…I have had friends, boyfriends, girlfriends, jobs, etc. But nothing ever sticks. Everyone goes away in the end. Every job I have, I quit. I’m not good at anything and so it’s hard for me to find joy in working. I’m a college dropout despite being academically intelligent. But even so, I feel like a complete failure.

In terms of friendships, I always seem to befriend the wrong people. Most of my friends never actually cared about me. They were all drug addicts and drug taxers. I’ve had “friends” steal from me, lie to me and generally I always get abandoned or ghosted eventually. This has caused me to develop severe trust and abandonment issues. Also those “friends” actually got me hooked on drugs and alcohol for several years.

When it comes to romantic relationships, I’m bisexual and have had success in having some long term relationships. However I’ve cheated on almost everyone I’ve ever been with. I don’t know why, likely the fear of being vulnerable. The fear of being abandoned. But every time I’ve done it. I tell the person immediately after and break things off. Because I have a massive guilty conscience and hate lying to people.

I have also physically abused some of the people I’ve dated (grabbing them by the shirt or chest, pushing them. I’ve never punched them or anything like that). It’s like I have two personalities…I can be kind, empathetic, gentle, supportive, well adjusted. But I have a horrible temper and a compulsion to destroy things. When people make me angry everything becomes a blur. Only for me to just “snap” out of it. I’m either a kind hearted gentle person or an extremely violently angry person. It’s like there’s no in between.

When I’m angry, I lash out to an extreme length. I’ve thrown things at walls and yell so loudly that many of my partners are genuinely terrified of me in the moment. Almost two years ago, I got into a horrible fight with my now ex fiancé. It’s somewhat difficult to explain but I pushed him, he fell back and as he did; one of my fingernails scratched the top of his forehead. For weeks afterwards he had a large scratch on his head. The guilt of that killed me on the inside and it still does.

Two years later, out of emotionally crippling guilt I got back into contact with my exes that I have physically and verbally abused. To just have some form of closure and again sincerely apologize for the bad things I’ve done. To my amazement and disbelief, they all forgave me. They all genuinely don’t think I’m a bad person and they think that my explosive temper is some sort of trauma response. However I feel that I don’t deserve their forgiveness. 

I began to realize that self harming stopped my explosive temper. If I lash out at myself first, I can’t lash out at other people. So I cut my left arm almost every night with a razor blade because it snaps me out of my negative state without hurting other people.

Since I am on the topic of romantic relationships, my sex life has been nonexistent. It’s actually incredibly difficult for me to have sex. It takes me a very long time to even be comfortable with somebody before I have sex with him. And it’s incredibly common for me to start having a panic attack just before having sex. I hyperventilate and start shaking violently. 

And what’s even worse is that I’ve never have dated or been with anybody that has ever comforted me during one of these episodes. I just have to get over it myself and wait it out. More often than not my romantic partner(s) are annoyed by it instead of empathizing with me. Which has really affected my self-esteem and sexual confidence 

Last year I was also involved in a horrible car accident and was nearly killed. I almost died from blood loss that was due to an injury on my left arm. And yes when I cut myself, I do cut my left arm with the razor blade specifically because it reminds me of the car accident. I’m not sure why I do that but I do.

The accident was quite traumatic for me and I don’t think I’ve ever been the same since it happened. I don’t feel like the same person anymore and my mental health issues got significantly worse since it happened to me.

The fact that my exes have forgiven me gives me the tiniest amount of hope that maybe I am a good person and there is some sort of redeemable quality in me. I feel like a horrible failure of a person that’s failed in every aspect of their life. And I don’t blame anyone reading this for hating me as well.

And yes while I have gone through some trauma that’s no excuse for my poor behavior in the past. I don’t think I will ever be able to forgive myself and honestly I think I deserve my suffering. I often think about suicide because I think that’s what I deserve. I don’t see any other way out. I’ve gone to therapy for 10 years, I’ve been on every anti-depressant and antipsychotic medication on the market. I just don’t know what else to do.


Honestly, why would anybody want to be my friend? Why would anybody want to have me as a girlfriend or wife? When you’ve done the things that I have done and have experienced the things that I have experienced. How can I ever be honest with somebody without being terrified of them hurting or leaving me?",0,2,2,1.0,0,,/r/depression/comments/13t497j/f27_i_feel_like_a_complete_failure/,True,False

4,depression,2023-05-27 09:59:08,Last_Temperature_55,I quick my antidepressants cold turkey and now regretting it.,I quit taking my antidepressants just a couple days ago going full cold turkey. I was on 75mg of Effexor which didn’t do much and also found out I my parents didn’t want to pay for healthcare. I’m a 20 year old women so I was able to be on it for another 5 years. Upon finding this out this means no more therapy because it was going to be $67 out of pocket and another $70 for the meds. Money is tight so I decided to go cold turkey with the help of some “trees” So far it’s been pretty hellish going through withdraw but I’m wondering what I did was wrong and if maybe paying the extra $300 (i use to go to therapy twice a month) was worth going through the withdrawal. I really didn’t want to have to depend on the meds so much but things were getting mentally tough at the beginning of this year. I haven’t been able to talk to anyone about this who really can give much feedback because my parents think taking medication is bs anyway and my bf offered to pay for it but we really don’t have the money for it (plus getting healthcare in my state is nearly impossible unless you have kids) I know he just wants what’s best for me but I really want to get off this stuff and be able to sort things out with out the meds. If I do feel like I’m going to hurt myself or feel bad I will go back to the therapy and meds. Just right now I don’t think I’m able to with my current situation. In all honesty I feel pretty fine and things have been pretty normal with me. I’m just not sure if what I did was the smart decision but I’m already going on my 3rd day without taking my meds.,0,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/depression/comments/13t3e2x/i_quick_my_antidepressants_cold_turkey_and_now/,False,False

Recently, I lost my father and I am not even able to feel the pain of losing him or crying for him. I feel guilty every single day. Also I have lost the hope to feel normal again. I asked the doc and he said you’ll be fine after a few weeks of stopping the meds but he’s just not letting get off them. 

I have also forgotten how to talk to people. I usually stay mum now and barely say a few words. That’s why I don’t feel like like meeting any of my friends.

7,depression,2023-05-27 09:46:39,ThrwawyNoLove,my best friend is getting married and I feel so insecure,"We‘re both in our late twenties and marriage is huge in my culture. Her bf converted for her and they‘ve been together for a few years now.



I feel like she has her life more together than me. I always was a person that needs more time for everything and I struggled a lot in life - like a lot of mental health issues, a family on my mom’s side that was very dysfunctional to the point it even affected us sometimes due to my mom being traumatized by them, struggling in school/university/relationships… 


I‘m also in the process of getting diagnosed for ADHD (inattentive type) because up until 2020 I was an even huger mess. I was able to finish university and get a job, but ever since then I felt so empty. I also had a lot of sexual abuse trauma in my life. Because of the last encounter, I didn‘t have a partner in 7 years, because my self esteem is so low. Despite 5 years of therapy (3 different types), a psychiatric daily clinic stay, medication etc. I never got over it fully. I was diagnosed with Avoidant personality disorder at age 22.


Now that my friend is marrying soon, I‘m reminded once again how much I don‘t live up to anyone. I‘ll get asked why I haven‘t married yet.


I can‘t tell anyone it‘s because I think I‘m too ugly and unworthy for that. I can’t tell anyone the aspect of someone touching me or seeing me in vulnerable moments makes me nauseous. I only told my therapist about it but my therapy ended in 2022… It‘s embarrassing and pathetic. I truly believe it though. I‘ve completly shut myself off. I‘ve felt disconnected from my feelings for the past year now.


Work keeps me busy but I‘m so bad at doing stuff by myself. Organizing things, managing money etc. is so hard for me. It takes too much energy… If it was up to me, I‘d just want to live on a small farm or small forest house, have some animals and live a life without anyone. 


I tell people I‘m not interested in a relationship and honestly 90% of the time I‘m not. I feel too overwhelmed with my daily life to care about another person and most people around me are very superficial regarding looks. But the fact that I‘m the only single friend in my entire circle makes me so self concious… It makes me feel inadequate


Anything I achieved seems irrelevant. It doesn‘t matter that I struggled through university yet still graduated, I think it‘s worthless and anyone can do it.

14,depression,2023-05-27 08:32:50,watchahhh,My downward spiral due to addiction and my desire to “upkeep an appearance.”,"I have been living a very different life than what a lot of people think I do. Some people know some things and others don’t see much at all, but I can truly say nobody really has a clear view of how my life currently is. I have had severe depression for years now and for the vast majority of it I have been on medication. I can’t explain why but my for a lot of my life I have been lying about so much about so many things simply to have others either not worry about me or not think down of me. This can range from stuff when I was a teenager in school to present day in my adult life. The major way I have been coping with my depression recently is use of alcohol and marijuana. It usually comes in spikes (?) where I drink/smoke heavily for a couple days. I think really the only reason why I stop is because after a few days my body hurts far too much. For a few months now I have stop taking my medication completely and seeing my psychiatrist/therapist. Full on ghosted them. The reality of why I did this is I have put myself into debt through these habits and at the time I chose to use my income for more self destructive habits than actual treatment. I knew then it was a horrible decision and I still understand that now. The more I reflect on the hole I have dug for myself in the last couple of years the more I realize how monstrously hard this will be to get myself out of. I want to work on paying my debts and receive some sort of therapy again. Paying for everything that I need to will take several months as I do not work a great job by any means. I absolutely can’t ask anyone for help with this because I can’t do that to them. I would feel horrible. To me it’s so much easier to get shitfaced drunk just for those moments where I don’t feel horrible about what I have been doing to my life. I don’t really know how to end this other than this is the first time I have vented my internal thoughts and situation in at least 3 years.",0,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/depression/comments/13t208v/my_downward_spiral_due_to_addiction_and_my_desire/,False,False
