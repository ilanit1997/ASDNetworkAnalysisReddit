I know it is supposed to take weeks if not months to feel a difference, but every day has been filled with dread, constant self hate, low energy, bad mood, and just wanting to end my life. If anything depression is worse than before and have even less energy to fight.

On top of that, I have gained 20lbs since started brintellix, and I worry if I don't stop this medication then I will be depressed and overweight. I can feel myself having a strong negative mental reaction to being overweight, which I think in itself is something to understand (why do I feel this way?).

21,22,yes,depression,2022-11-15 09:16:53,luna_bea_tuna,Visualized tools for depression,"Hi - I suffer from anxiety and depression and take medication for both, and am in therapy to articulate the way I feel, have someone challenge or validate feelings, and learn tools to use on a daily basis to help myself when I am feeling deep sadness, hopelessness or purposelessness. 

What I haven't been able to do is really take anything I learn in therapy to help myself outside of the 24hr window after therapy. My brain is so fuzzy that I struggle to remember the tools I have learned and it feels like I haven't grown at all and am in the same spot as years ago. So I get caught in the whirlwind and spin out.

I started watching (haven't finished) the Jonah Hill netflix special about his therapist, who uses some drawing/visualization techniques (in the therapy session at least) and I felt inspired. I am thinking of having physical things to remind me of different tools to use - either like actual objects/jewelry or drawing/non-permanent tattoo/stickers. 

So for reddit I ask this:

1. What are your ''tools'' / techniques for working through feelings in the moment?
2. Do you have any physical/visualized objects/techniques to remind yourself? Or if not, how do you remember them? Or jolt yourself out of a moment to remember that you even have tools?

I expect not every technique works for everyone, and that everyone struggles with different depression and anxiety challenges, but I appreciate any shared thoughts.

I never look forward to being with her. Our relationship and fights are what pushes me into depression, though I’m sure I would be miserable anyway. We have tried couples therapy and I think we need more help but she doesn’t want to go to more. I really want a divorce.

But wait! We have a 3 year old, and both live abroad temporarily and both come from different countries. So if we split up, there’s no clear way we can both be with our child unless we continue living abroad, which I know she will not want. And maybe we can’t afford to live apart either. Neat!

There’s no future I can imagine where I will be happy. Either stay in a shit marriage for the kid, or divorce and maybe fuck up their life because probably I wont be around since I wont be able to live in the same country. 

Everyday for the past 20+ years I’ve thought about killing myself / wishing I were dead. I tell myself “you are a piece of shit. You are a monster” every day.

My fiancé and I are both disabled, mainly in huge part to our mental health. But these past couple months we’ve had some positive changes happening around our life and more to come. Mainly along the lines of finally being able to make a more accommodating apartment space that could potentially help us a whole lot with daily functioning. 

I know during the Winter people tend to feel depression symptoms going up. But I don’t know if it’s just that for me. Because every time I have things going on, I think about people that aren’t around in my life anymore and it just pushes me further into depression. 

My father walked out on me as a teen and I often think where he is in life and when I have things going on, what he would think of me. My grandmother passed away 4 years ago, before I had any semblance of stability and so I often wish I could share this life I’ve been building with her. I think about friends that just aren’t around. And more recently having to distance myself from the rest of my family, and so I think a lot about how I can’t share any of my life with them. For my own sanity, trust me, it’s best not to. 

I’m also neurodivergent and I struggle immensely with building relationships and making friends. So when I have a lot of changes happening, it quickly feels isolating and lonely because I genuinely don’t have anyone I can share it with. I’m part of a small community on Instagram, and a lot of my internet friends are always happy to hear what’s going on, but it’s more of passing updates. It’s never full conversations about my life or theirs. Not anymore. All the friends I used to have that used to know everything about my life, don’t want to be in my life anymore.

At one point over initial pandemic my depression got pretty bad. I was basically showering once a week, IF that. It was so hard to feel any motivation to for reasons on top of my depression. 

What I wasn’t expecting though is that in that time I was going to create more problems for myself later. I’ve always struggled on and off with dry scalp and dandruff. I’ve changed my shampoo and shampooing routine more times than I can count. It didn’t occur to me that not showering often enough for an extended period was going to cause extremely stubborn build up on my scalp. 

At this point it’s led to my hair falling out. And the worst part is it’s BARELY motivating me to wash it more frequently. I’ve switched to more natural products and have bought this specific scalp scrubber, and also have been doing oil treatments. I think I’d be seeing quicker progress if I could stick to being consistent with it. I even cut off all my hair to make things easier. 

It just sucks. It brings up feelings of me being a failure in some way because there’s this awful in my face physical evidence that I can’t take care of myself well enough.

Hey everyone, I'm 27, in college, and I have major depressive disorder, PTSD, and anxiety disorder. 5 years ago, I was able to hold a job, I was in college, and I had stability. I decided to quit work, and my wife and I went to school together. 
I'm still in school, after failing a few classes and being unable to keep up with the course work, I tried to calm the school thing down and go part time and work part time. Well, 5 jobs this year and I haven't managed to keep a hold of one for over a month. I have panic attacks that are so bad that I faint or throw up. And it's just over leaving the house. I've tried to relax, tried to find outlets with friends and I can't even manage that these days. My wife is super supportive, and kind. She understands, but I feel like I'm letting her down by failing so much at what I set out to do. I'm an artist, and haven't even sat down to paint or draw in months. 
This decline has happened over the course of a year, I'm feeling worse and worse about myself, I'm terrified I'm going to lose financial aid, and that we'll be homeless. I feel so hopeless and worthless.
I don't have insurance, and there's no counselor or therapist that's free out here that's equipped to handle someone like me, I've tried the only free resource out here. 
I genuinely don't know what started this decline in my mental state. Idk if it's just childhood trauma coming to a head, if that's the case why it started now, or how to even get out of it. I need advice and resources to resolve this...

i was referred to a local mental health team but it has been months and it is so difficult to talk to anyone. they call me and either i miss the call or i'm really not prepared for the call so i don't answer. i call back and they are either engaged or i speak to a receptionist and nobody is available and they will call me back but it takes hours and i do not feel like talking at that point. i asked if i could communicate with them via email but apparently the receptionist can't give out any emails because the person who has the email address would have to agree. i was thinking of writing a letter but i'm worried they will just tell me to call. i am okay with appointments where i have to see someone because i see that as a situation where i have to be in a room and at least something will happen (and i have practiced this way of thinking with seeing the doctor and it has worked. i am still polite and don't say how bad things really are but i have written things down and have spoken more than i ever have - but my doctor changed and my new doctor has basically referred me to this mental health team and said they are just their for medication reviews so the one place i started to feel relatively comfortable talking feels closed off).

i've asked family for support but again, talking isn't so great  so i emailed and they haven't mentioned anything to me. it has been a week. i'm not sure what to do. my work doesn't make me feel so good and i have had interview dates for a few new jobs but i can't bring myself to go and cancel and i'm closing doors that maybe could make things a bit better and i don't want to but i think not having the interviews is better than turning up and having a rough time at the moment as it will sink my mood even more.

Every view means her smile is on one more screen. And I'm keeping her memory alive. Thanks,"We met @ school w about 350 ppl in an auditorium. I had seen her speak and It was love at first sight. She was brilliant and beautiful and nerdy, and sarcastic, and spunky. 
I got the courage together to walk up to the podium without permission in front of 350 ppl . And I went to the mic and said. ""My names John and I'm madly in love with Victoria Vaughn! Will u go out w me""? The whole place went nuts. I got in trouble and she got embaressed. We were together after that.  Lol we both had issues w addiction. We ended up dating for 3 yrz. 

We got sober together, baptized together, and then we got engaged. We had a little tiny 1 bedroom apartment on the ocean in north Florida. And they were the greatest memories of my life. Times were simple. And no one existed on the planet except her and I. We prayed together everyday. And there was a buzz about us, because we kind of knew if we stayed sober, what an incredible team we would make.

 She was straight a, very driven and positive person. One of the hardest workers I had ever met.. AND THE ONLY WOMAN MY MOTHER AND DAUGHTER EVER APPROVVED OF...But we relapsed and fell apart. And she ended up moving to Virginia to get away from the drugs and finally b ful time mother to her son. I respected her for that. The plan was, we both get it together, and someday, we find eachother again.

 Unbeknownst to us. She had picked up drinking. And after only 4 yrs. She got cirocis of the liver. When she got ill I was luckily sober and begged to b by her side. I texted her and called her everyday. She refused to let me see her in that state. We were expecting  a liver transfer and a long road to recovery. But she passed away on Monday night due to an anuerism and then no brain function. 

I made this video to deal w the trauma n grief of being sober and never in 36 yrs feeling this way about a loss. But man am I grateful for the ability. I've lost my father, my little sister, my 2 very best friends, my boss, and my ex gf, and now my ex fiance, all to this disease. Which is why I started the reddit grp
 r/sobrietynothercoolsht in the first place. 

Here is a video I made to try and express how much I loved her. I sang it to her all the time and I changed out the chorus from ""euphoria"" to her name ""victoria"" it always made her smile. Let this b a message. This disease of addiction is running us down, no matter our condition and its slaughtering us. We have a better chance of surviving war, than we do a disease of the mind that perpetuates fear and uncertainty and emotio instability. If u r surviving today. You are a physical tangible, piece of evidence that god exists. And I am here for each and every single one that reads this msg. Dm me anytime. Because there is someone out there that feels this same way about you. Love u guys.

23,24,,depression,2023-05-27 06:25:11,OrganizedErraticism,My Disposition,"Not necessarily looking for a diagnosis as much as I am to vent-however, thoughts on what I may be experiencing are welcome.
Notes/behaviors:
1. For some time I’ve been someone who becomes completely captivated by a particular thing and obsesses over it until suddenly I become disinterested. Looking back on it it’s unfortunate because there have been a lot of things if I had never stopped pursuing could have a future in. I learn the things I envelop myself in fairly quickly and it’s almost like my brain hits a threshold of satisfaction prompting me to want nothing to do with said thing anymore. Throughout the years I’ve spent copious amounts of money/time into things I’ve never fully pursued.
2. I’ve noticed unwise purchasing decisions, mostly recently. I think this could be because I never had much to spend before recently. One of my things I picked up was trading card collecting, I’ve spent a few thousand dollars on trading cards and when I get them in I never feel satisfied, I feel like I’m supposed to feel something else-yet, I keep buying them. I lost $600 sports betting today on bets I really wasn’t educated on, and lost $3k last week, thankfully gambling is something I had just picked up and am leaving behind. I amass money and it feels like I need to get rid of it, and so I spend and then I feel awful and anxious about my financial security, why?
3. Repeating actions to try and feel satisfied. Recently I’ve been noticing that I’ve been repeating actions such as pushing my hair back, biting my nails, picking up and putting something down until it “feels right”, but it never feels right and it becomes a monotonous cycle that affects my job/life and the more I think about it the more uncomfortable it makes me.
4. Obsessing over things that could be “wrong” with me. I once spent 7 hours researching literature on schizoaffective disorder because I noticed one or two things that I seem to have related to and thought it must be what’s wrong with me. This extends to practically anything ex. Spot on skin (skin cancer), and in that moment it really feels like I have it and I believe it, I always eventually become rational and realize I don’t but when I get caught up in this catastrophic type mentality it becomes debilitating. Believing that something catastrophic is wrong with me or a loved one creates a subconscious perception that the rest of my life is meaningless.
5. Alcoholism- I just completed my graduate degree and looking back on my last few years in college I can’t put together more than a three day consecutive span where I was completely sober. This scares me and I tell myself drinking every other day or every two days is okay-but it’s not. 
6. Purpose/The future- I have two degrees, the latter of which I finished first in my class. I’ve had some great job opportunities but for some reason am settling for mediocrity. I’ve even had a few Professor go out of there way to have people in my industry interview me- all of which I missed or never contacted back and the shame I would feel after blowing these opportunities is immense, but yet I keep doing it. Now I need a good job, the clock is ticking, and I don’t have one. I often think about what the point is or why I’m here and the lack of a fulfilling answer cripples me.",0,2,2,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13szy9w')>,,/r/depression/comments/13szy9w/my_disposition/,,,False,False

The weird thing i know how to fix my life

for example:
Like i hate my body but i know I can have  an amazing body if i just worked out for 3 months.....
it's not just hating my body i can't find my purpose in life

but i have no energy no purpose to do anything in my life , i don't want to be dramatic but every single time i go to sleep i wish not to wake up, and everytime i wake up i get little bit sad that i Woke up !

there's no self harm i just gave up life and can't get it back , nothing matters im cold AF and losing emotions everyday


im venting and hoping if someone explain what happened to my brain suddenly i switched from an enthusiastic person to someone who (have + going to ) give up in every single challenge , and failed everything in life from Education - Relationship - Work

26,27,,depression,2023-05-27 06:08:57,BipolarDisorderly,What if I never find peace in my lifetime?,"I've always been able to find pleasure in life, I just don't know if I've ever enjoyed it. It's gotten a lot worse where, it's pretty apparent I'm not enjoying life at all no matter what I do. I made a vow to myself though when I first started dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts where I made the decision that I would never give up no matter how bad things got. And I never have, because I believe our lives are short enough that I could endure an entire lifetime of suffering even if I'm only doing it just to find out if things will get better. Which brings me to my point... What if things actually do never get better?

&#x200B;

That's the reality I'm trying to prepare myself for, because what if that's just the way I am? That I'm just someone who can't enjoy life?
