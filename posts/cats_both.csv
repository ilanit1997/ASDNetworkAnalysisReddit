369,370,yes,cats,2022-06-20 18:48:54,thefrustratedpoet,Feral Fawcett update - TW/ sad news,"Feral made it through her spaying surgery today, but we‚Äôve had some bad news. Feral tested positive for FIV. We‚Äôre not able to keep her because she‚Äôs a risk to our two cats. 

We are absolutely heartbroken, as you can imagine. Feral is the sweetest and most affectionate cat. 

I had worried about it when we brought her into the house in February, but the vet wasn‚Äôt worried, probably because she didn‚Äôt behave like a street cat at all. She was cuddly and cute and gentle. 

Since she had her kittens she‚Äôs been losing weight, but we just put it down to nursing, and she‚Äôs had a bad stomach every couple of weeks, which we put down to her being in heat, or at worst, IBD. But it‚Äôs FIV. We have to rehome her as soon as we can, either to a rescue centre, or to a household that where she is the only cat, or where she is with other FIV cats. 

She will have to be a house cat, or live in a house with a completely enclosed garden so that she can‚Äôt infect other cats.

I feel so lost and devastated. We love her so much, and were making plans for after recovery and rehoming of the kittens. She was going to be our cat. But now that‚Äôs not possible.

I fell in love with her the day we brought her in and she looked up at me with big thankful eyes.

I know we‚Äôve given her a happy home these past 6 months, she‚Äôs had the best food, veterinary care and love as we nurses her back to health and through her pregnancy and we also took good care of her before then in the garden. We‚Äôve known her for a year.

There‚Äôs a good chance that the kittens aren‚Äôt FIV positive, but we won‚Äôt know until they are 5-6 months old and can be tested. That‚Äôs still 3 or 4 months away, but the risk is low. But one of the adopters can‚Äôt take the risk because of their existing cat, and the other adopter is making some tough choices tonight.

This has been the hardest day. And it will only get harder.",1,6,6,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='vgsq32')>,,/r/cats/comments/vgsq32/feral_fawcett_update_tw_sad_news/,,,False,True

[Feral and her 3 babies](https://preview.redd.it/i1grikcobq591.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3e58413d01683aa57ea393e7c95902effb9d6f2a)

Feral has been poorly again the past few days and the vet has suggested that she may have Inflammatory Bowel Disease. We're also preparing for the rehoming of her babies, and I'm so worried about what the stress will do to her. We've started separating her from the kittens for mealtimes to give her a break (they are a LOT).

I'd like some advice on the future... we have 2 cats who were settled into a routine foodwise, and eat specific food. Their routine has been spoiled since we brought Feral into the house in February, and we're still not able to spay her (4 weeks depending on her tummy), so she's in the house all the time.

I've never had a cat with additional needs before, and it's hard. A lot of cleaning up and chasing Feral away from food, as well as kitten wrangling ([kittens](https://www.reddit.com/r/kittens/comments/vcnx7e/8_weeks_old_and_just_going_to_be_so_hard_to_rehome/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) are all fine and gorgeous).

We are prepared, to be in it for the long haul - we think she was abandoned by her previous owner (she's still a juvenile and was living in our back garden last summer) because of her digestive issues. We think this because she knew how to use a litter box when we took her in and she is a loving and sweet cat who's behaviour suggests she once had a home.

I just need to know whether a cat with IBD can live with other cats successfully, or whether she needs to be the only cat in the house. I hope it's the former, because honestly, Feral Fawcett is the sweetest cat, still a kitten really, and I want to give her the happy forever home she deserves. But I also want what is best for her, and if that means rehoming, I'll have to deal with that...",1,2,2,0.76,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='vco2ah')>,,/r/cats/comments/vco2ah/update_on_feral_fawcett/,,,False,True

[Queen Feral Fawcett](https://preview.redd.it/eiit5agbol391.png?width=3282&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4cb264e0f440549e6ffa1282dbf63fd8cda40b6e)

Our gorgeous rescue kitty, Feral Fawcett, has been with us for nearly 6 months. She gave birth 7 weeks ago to 3 beautiful kittens and is just a wonderful mother. We're feeding her 4 times per day, the recommended amount of adult cat food each day, enriched with some kitten food, PLUS she's eating the babies' leftovers. She's only nursing for comfort now, and the kittens are 90% weaned onto kitten food, but Feral is ALWAYS hungry, as soon as she''s finished eating, she bugs us for food all the time. She's always trying to sneak into the kitchen and jump on the counters trying to find food.

We can't leave kibble down for grazing as she is very allergic to every kind we've tried (I'm talking poo-mageddon whenever she has biscuits or treats), even wheat-free, gluten-free, pro-biotic enriched. We've got her on Royal Canin Gastrointestinal adult cat food, mixed with Lily's Adult pate (as the kittens have Lily's too). We actually think she had a home before we found her, but that she might have been abandoned because she had constant diarrhoea and made lots of messes in the house. 

She's been treated for Giardia and her tummy is much better, but she's still always hungry. We're worried about overfeeding and making her sick. Should we just feed her whenever she asks?

TIA 

PS - Yes, we have taken her to the vet multiple times for her tummy issues, but we'd like to try and address this particular issue at home before we take her again.",6,3,3,0.72,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='v4o531')>,,/r/cats/comments/v4o531/always_hungry/,,,False,True

45,46,,cats,2023-05-27 08:06:14,MildlyAnxiousRaccoon,How cautiously optimistic should we be? Possible lymphoma or bacterial infection? Enlarged spleen.,"Hello,

We have had an eventful week. Our sweet 8 year old girl suddenly started experiencing vomiting and diarrhea and was extremely lethargic. 4-5 hours after she first vomited and wasn‚Äôt getting any better, we took her the emergency animal hospital. 

They did blood work and imaging and she had elevated white blood cell count as well as an enlarged spleen (2.5cm). The vet suspected either lymphoma (worst case scenario) or a nasty bacterial infection (best case scenario). She had lost about 1.3 lbs since her check up in January (although we did move states in that time and also moved to a place with much more space). They gave her an antibiotic injection and tablets as well as fluids and they took a fine needle aspirate sample of her spleen to be tested. Originally they told us 24-48 hours for results to come back. Today they told us there was an issue and the slides couldn‚Äôt be read digitally so they needed to manually mail the samples to the lab and results won‚Äôt be available for 7-10 business days. (Kind of scary since untreated lymphoma can take a cat in a matter of weeks and we will be spending two of those weeks waiting for cytosis results.)

After we got home from the vet, our baby got worse. She could barely lift her head, stopped purring, and couldn‚Äôt eat or drink anything. But around 12 hours after her antibiotic injection she started moving around a little more and at 24 hours she was almost back to her normal self. At 48 hours, she is still a bit weak but she‚Äôs trotting around, responding to her name, purring, grooming, using the litter box, chirping, and eating/drinking well (all things she couldn‚Äôt do before). 

We‚Äôre driving ourselves crazy waiting for the cytology results which won‚Äôt be in for another week and a half. 

We‚Äôre being hopeful that it really was just an infection and she‚Äôs recovering. I can‚Äôt imagine the antibiotics would be making her feel better if it was cancer? But I‚Äôm still worried that maybe it‚Äôs just a momentary improvement and she‚Äôll go downhill again. 

The severity of the bacterial infection if that‚Äôs what it truly was is very alarming. She went from totally fine to not being able to lift her head within ~8 hours. We have no idea how she could have contracted it. She‚Äôs indoor only. Any advice on how to prevent reinfection? 

We have completely replaced her litter and litter box and bought a new water fountain. I‚Äôm washing all her bedding in hot, soapy water and we washed all her food bowls. Any other precautions you would recommend? 

Any experience or advice would be helpful, we‚Äôre going crazy waiting for her results!",1,1,1,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13t1l6p')>,,/r/cats/comments/13t1l6p/how_cautiously_optimistic_should_we_be_possible/,,,False,False
