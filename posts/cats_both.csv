256,cats,2022-06-20 18:48:54,thefrustratedpoet,Feral Fawcett update - TW/ sad news,"Feral made it through her spaying surgery today, but we’ve had some bad news. Feral tested positive for FIV. We’re not able to keep her because she’s a risk to our two cats. 

We are absolutely heartbroken, as you can imagine. Feral is the sweetest and most affectionate cat. 

I had worried about it when we brought her into the house in February, but the vet wasn’t worried, probably because she didn’t behave like a street cat at all. She was cuddly and cute and gentle. 

Since she had her kittens she’s been losing weight, but we just put it down to nursing, and she’s had a bad stomach every couple of weeks, which we put down to her being in heat, or at worst, IBD. But it’s FIV. We have to rehome her as soon as we can, either to a rescue centre, or to a household that where she is the only cat, or where she is with other FIV cats. 

She will have to be a house cat, or live in a house with a completely enclosed garden so that she can’t infect other cats.

I feel so lost and devastated. We love her so much, and were making plans for after recovery and rehoming of the kittens. She was going to be our cat. But now that’s not possible.

I fell in love with her the day we brought her in and she looked up at me with big thankful eyes.

I know we’ve given her a happy home these past 6 months, she’s had the best food, veterinary care and love as we nurses her back to health and through her pregnancy and we also took good care of her before then in the garden. We’ve known her for a year.

There’s a good chance that the kittens aren’t FIV positive, but we won’t know until they are 5-6 months old and can be tested. That’s still 3 or 4 months away, but the risk is low. But one of the adopters can’t take the risk because of their existing cat, and the other adopter is making some tough choices tonight.

This has been the hardest day. And it will only get harder.",1,2,2,0.67,0,,/r/cats/comments/vgsq32/feral_fawcett_update_tw_sad_news/,False,True
257,cats,2022-06-15 06:30:03,thefrustratedpoet,Update on Feral Fawcett,"Tl;dr - Feral Fawcett may have IBD and I don't know if she can live with other cats - advice please!

[Feral and her 3 babies](https://preview.redd.it/i1grikcobq591.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3e58413d01683aa57ea393e7c95902effb9d6f2a)

Feral has been poorly again the past few days and the vet has suggested that she may have Inflammatory Bowel Disease. We're also preparing for the rehoming of her babies, and I'm so worried about what the stress will do to her. We've started separating her from the kittens for mealtimes to give her a break (they are a LOT).

I'd like some advice on the future... we have 2 cats who were settled into a routine foodwise, and eat specific food. Their routine has been spoiled since we brought Feral into the house in February, and we're still not able to spay her (4 weeks depending on her tummy), so she's in the house all the time.

I've never had a cat with additional needs before, and it's hard. A lot of cleaning up and chasing Feral away from food, as well as kitten wrangling ([kittens](https://www.reddit.com/r/kittens/comments/vcnx7e/8_weeks_old_and_just_going_to_be_so_hard_to_rehome/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) are all fine and gorgeous).

We are prepared, to be in it for the long haul - we think she was abandoned by her previous owner (she's still a juvenile and was living in our back garden last summer) because of her digestive issues. We think this because she knew how to use a litter box when we took her in and she is a loving and sweet cat who's behaviour suggests she once had a home.

I just need to know whether a cat with IBD can live with other cats successfully, or whether she needs to be the only cat in the house. I hope it's the former, because honestly, Feral Fawcett is the sweetest cat, still a kitten really, and I want to give her the happy forever home she deserves. But I also want what is best for her, and if that means rehoming, I'll have to deal with that...",1,2,2,0.76,0,,/r/cats/comments/vco2ah/update_on_feral_fawcett/,False,True
258,cats,2022-06-04 12:45:28,thefrustratedpoet,ALWAYS HUNGRY!!!,"***Tl;dr - Rescue mama cat, 18mths old, always hungry but can't eat kibble due to allergy.***

[Queen Feral Fawcett](https://preview.redd.it/eiit5agbol391.png?width=3282&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4cb264e0f440549e6ffa1282dbf63fd8cda40b6e)

Our gorgeous rescue kitty, Feral Fawcett, has been with us for nearly 6 months. She gave birth 7 weeks ago to 3 beautiful kittens and is just a wonderful mother. We're feeding her 4 times per day, the recommended amount of adult cat food each day, enriched with some kitten food, PLUS she's eating the babies' leftovers. She's only nursing for comfort now, and the kittens are 90% weaned onto kitten food, but Feral is ALWAYS hungry, as soon as she''s finished eating, she bugs us for food all the time. She's always trying to sneak into the kitchen and jump on the counters trying to find food.

We can't leave kibble down for grazing as she is very allergic to every kind we've tried (I'm talking poo-mageddon whenever she has biscuits or treats), even wheat-free, gluten-free, pro-biotic enriched. We've got her on Royal Canin Gastrointestinal adult cat food, mixed with Lily's Adult pate (as the kittens have Lily's too). We actually think she had a home before we found her, but that she might have been abandoned because she had constant diarrhoea and made lots of messes in the house. 

She's been treated for Giardia and her tummy is much better, but she's still always hungry. We're worried about overfeeding and making her sick. Should we just feed her whenever she asks?

TIA 

PS - Yes, we have taken her to the vet multiple times for her tummy issues, but we'd like to try and address this particular issue at home before we take her again.",6,3,3,0.72,0,,/r/cats/comments/v4o531/always_hungry/,False,True

261,cats,2022-05-21 11:09:32,thefrustratedpoet,Poo-pocalypse,"We rescued our cat (Feral Fawcett) in February. She’s had bad diarrhoea almost every day. She gave birth to 3 kittens 6 weeks ago and it seems even worse.

We spoke to the vet and they suggested an allergy so we got special food.

We have her on GI Royal Canin food with pre-biotic powder. We don’t let her have any kibble (that seems to make it worse). 

Should we try her on raw food? She was a living outside before we took her in. I’m starting to think she was abandoned because of her tummy issues. We would never do that, we just want to help her.

It’s worse at the moment as we can’t even let her outside because she’s not been spayed, so she’s pooping in the tray and makes such a mess every day.",10,2,2,0.76,0,,/r/cats/comments/uukwqv/poopocalypse/,False,True

1975,cats,2023-01-10 07:10:22,introvertedfreak21,"Just gushing about my cat, Pepper","So, about three days ago, my fiance and I got our first pet. My parents have a cat colony around their home, they feed the cats and sometimes new ones show up. They only have one fertile female that has been hard to trap to spay and that cat had some kittens. We thought it was just three, two gray and one black and white. One gray boy was given to a family friend and my parents kept the other two. Well, about a week ago a gray female cat started showing up. She looks exactly like the mom cat and the gray brother my parents have so we think she is the same age as the other kittens. She isn't spayed yet but my parents told us she was a very friendly cat and were able to get her inside so we could take her home.

So, there is the story of how we got Pepper. She has been slowly coming out of her shell, its a big change from an outdoor cat colony. I'm just so happy and proud to see how far she has come. She went from hiding under our bed and only popping her head out to eat food and get a few pets to now, coming out and chilling on her own, being curious in what's beyond the bedroom door(it stays closed for now) and really enjoying our company.

Every little step forward makes me so happy. She is the first pet we have owned outside our parents' homes. I'm thinking of ways to make her happy and healthy. I don't use a gravity feeder because I've seen how it let's a cat over eat and I plan to use things like raw meat as a treat and changing up her food options. Like she has been doing great today so I gave her half a can of wet food as a treat for being so confident today. I would love any advice as well, I just want to give this sweet girl the best life I can for her. I'm gonna give her a month to get use to the house before I take her to the vet to be spayed and vaccinated. Thankfully at least 40 cats of the cat colony had been fixed, vaccinated, and had their ears tipped.
