my problem: now i have terrible anxiety that it’s going to happen to my dog. about 2-3 times a week, an hour after he eats, i get incredibly fucking anxious and start feeling my dog’s stomach, making sure it’s not hard and large. even though it’s not, i convince myself it feels harder/larger than usual and send myself into a panic attack thinking that he’s going to die - my dog is my life, and losing him like i lost my family dog so suddenly keeps me up at night. sometimes i also get anxious with just normal things. 

i just want to know when i’ll stop being anxious that his stomach will flip too. will it ever go away? or did my family dog just completely traumatize me?",6,0,0,0.5,0,,/r/dogs/comments/12v8mcq/when_does_the_anxiety_stop/,False,True

2878,dogs,2022-05-18 04:37:49,Tiger-eye224466,Am I wrong?,"My golden retriever has gone to the daycare attached to his vet for about a year (he’s almost 2). He only goes 2x a week but he LOVES it and it allows him to get all the attention he craves from people and other dogs. 

In the past few weeks (to be honest, since this new lady helper started working) he’s been written up twice and he gets kicked out the next time. Why? Because he tries to play with the anti-social dogs cowering in the corner. 

I asked more questions because at first I figured he wasn’t reading social cues and was an overbearing puppy (aka truly his fault). But no, he listens just fine and typically moves on to another dog who wants to play. 

The two times he got written up only a few dogs were there (not his usual buddies) and he had no playmates so he kept trying to get them to play. They admitted absolutely no aggression or dominance was seen, he was just an annoyance to the other anti-social dogs and they’ll bite eventually (and it’ll be his fault). 

I’m super confused. The other people who work at the daycare love him and say he’s an angel and actually get even get the shyest dogs more confident and willing to engage. Either way, shouldn’t the anti-social dogs be either kicked out of daycare or at least grouped together with other less playful dogs? I can’t imagine putting my dog in daycare if he hated it. 

If he does get kicked out, I plan to ask them to review who wrote him each time as she has always rubbed me the wrong way. This is the best rated local daycare so he’ll just be stuck at home otherwise. I don’t trust these other ones.",12,3,3,0.81,0,,/r/dogs/comments/us4vjh/am_i_wrong/,False,True

3021,dogs,2017-07-23 03:14:36,iamukiki,Rescue (2 year old hound mix) is terrified of storms and is getting worse [Help],"I rescued my now 2 year old hound mix last year. When the rescue found her, she was extremely malnourished, had a bad case of mange, and 5 puppies in the FL wilderness. It was summer during FLs 4ish months of daily thunder storms. To non natives, the storms tend to be brief, but bring lots of thunder, lightening, and heavy rain.

When I first rescued her she would tremble during storms. She was very submissive and skittish. We spent some time helping her conquer her fears and by the end of the season, the trembling stopped and she would go to her crate or cuddle during storms.

Jump to now after a 7 month drought and the trembling is back, but it is worse and she now hyperventilates. She stares at the ceiling like it will come down. The storms could be miles off and not even have lightening and she still breaks down. It's to the point where I wake up to her trembling in the night and have to strain to hear far off thunder. She seems to be getting worse with every strom.

Nothing helps...we have tried sprays, neck pillows, jackets and not even the slightest improvement. I have a co pletely blacked out room where lightening can't be seen and it doesn't matter. The best we can do is hold all 50lbs of her, but it doesn't help. Tonight I am cutting up an old sweater for her to wear every night so she gets used to wearing something to see if that makes her more secure (thunder vest are crazy expensive so I'm making my own unless it helps). 

Has anyone dealt with something like this and been able to help? It breaks my heart to watch her suffer and there are 4 months of daily storms every year. That's a long time to suffer. The vet offered meds, but I hate to do that to her unless there is truly no other option.

3036,dogs,2016-07-30 18:41:56,iamukiki,[Help] Need advice to help my dog get over her fear of thunder.,"I adopted a 1 year black mouth cur mix about 2 months ago. Before I brought her home, she had already been through a lot (found in the woods extremely malnourished with puppies, mange, and heartworms). She had definitely lived with someone before because she was completely house and kennel trained. For the most part, it has been fairly easy to break her bad habits and she is the perfect dog. I still need to socialize her more when the heartworms are gone, but she is not as skittish as when I got her. 

My big concern is she is terrified of thunder and lightening. I assume she lived in the woods and had a bad experience. Problem is, I live in Florida; there is thunder and lightening pretty much everyday in the summer. Every storm she trembles and goes to the bed or crate. She won't respond to commands or even take treats. So far I have been comforting her when she gets really bad, but is home alone in the crate for 4-5 hours 5 days a week. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to help her overcome this. I feel terrible when I see her whole body shake. I know she is terrified. She is not as afraid of people and other dogs, but that is with good repeated interactions.

228,dogs,2023-05-27 10:50:49,MitziKittyCat,My dog doesn't like us to pet her?,"We adopted our 5-year-old dog when she was around two years old. She was found in the street as an estimated 7 months old, and spent her time from foster to foster until we took her in. 

Around a month or so after moving with us, she started doing systematic attacks on friends when they came over. She would lunge, bark, whine, and bump her nose on their face, as if she was going to bite, but she never did bite anyone, thought it was super scary. She's a medium-big dog (22kg). Long story short, we worked with a trainer (she's our first dog), made her a safe space in the house (crate and bed), and learned to recognize her triggers, so we haven't had an incident in a while. 

One of her triggers is being pet. We are very strict with visitors that they shouldn't touch her, even though she will often rest her chin on their knees. Her attacks were always unpredictable, she doesn't growl before doing it and she will go from looking calm to suddenly attacking the visitor. 

All good now, and we have a super life all together and a lot of fun. However, we have noticed that when she's resting at home and we talk to her and praise her, she wags her tail, but when we start petting her, she suddenly stops. Are we reading her right? She doesn't like us, her humans, to pet her? Is that a thing? We're okay with respecting her boundaries even with us, but I am wondering if this is normal. She is rarely affectionate, for example sitting close to us on the couch, or looking happy to receive belly scratches.

1 female and 1 male dog. During mealtime, I go up to their fence door (they have a small backyard) and gesture for them to sit down which they do. Put their dog biscuits(?) in two bowls and add a bit of water to soften.

Place both in at the same time as they are behaving well (not jumping everywhere).

THIS time, the female dog finishes her food but the male one nibbles and growls. Like a low growl building up to a bark. I verbally ask ""what's wrong?"" - in English of course. And he stops. But less than a minute later, again the growls, with a bark. I feel like he's growling at the female that's just lying down having finished her meal.

This repeats a few times.

And he left maybe a third of his food untouched. While I'm staring he just sniffs it a bit, then turns away. A few times.

I try watering it a bit more - cause I dunno what to do. But still the waiting and some growling. There's even a few pieces of food on the floor, which they usually eat up real quick.

So after waiting more minutes (I'm just here helping feed the dogs) I decided I can't leave soggy food there overnight so I get a plastic bag from the car.

When the male sees it, he starts eating. 😅

He got sent home on anti nausea ondasteron, serenia and metroniazdole, and a gastroenteritis low fat canned food. Poops turned from soft serve to liquid over night. Went back in to the vet and got given proviable and biome gi canned food. 

Poops improved for half a day and then went right back to liquid with some blood in his stool as well. It's only been about 48 hours since this all started but I'm so scared

I'm devastated. I have no idea how this happened since he never gets human food and snacks are very rarely given. On top of that trupanion refused to cover our claim since he's had an episode of vomiting before.

It would be like this (on a work day) : wake up 7/8am, walk, work, home for lunch break, dog Walker, home, walk, dinner, bed 10/11pm. Then me and my partner went on holiday for 3 weeks and his mother came to stay at ours to look after our 2 dogs, Lola and Louis. Her favourite dog is Louis and boy does she let that be known, she ignores Lola and says how much she loves Louis and hugs him. In the past, she’s made Louis physically sick by giving him food that I’ve told her not to when she’s looked after him, eg cake and fast food! Anyway, so I made some rules: please stick to the same routine as much as possible, don’t feed them junk, don’t walk them excessively (she’s unemployed so she will take them none stop). So when we get back from our holidays, we’ve found out what the dogs new routine looks like: wake up at 4/5am (because that’s what time they wake her up and she happily gets up and gives them what they want instead of going back to sleep), walk all day, eat leftovers, bed. 
So now we’re back and MIL has left, Louis is miserable! He can’t believe we are doing this to him, only 3x1 hour walks a day and left 8 hours alone?! How can we do such a thing! To make things worse, I’ve got the flu since coming home so he can see I’m home but I’m just lying in bed, too Ill to take him out and he’s besides himself. Lola doesn’t care much as she is a foodie and doesn’t care about walks and MIL didn’t take her out all day unlike with Louis because she’s too strong (ridgeback). 
So now I feel the guilt and anxiety from Louis, he’s sitting at the front door constantly thinking we’re taking him out, he’s started to howl, he’s not sleeping with us at night, as soon as we get ready for work he’s excited thinking he’s going out (even though we’ve just taken him out for 45mins/1hour) and he wakes us up at stupid times 4/5am! I wish I could say to him “I’m sorry, we have to go to work to make money so you can eat and have toys” or say “I’m sorry, I’m sick, I can’t get up today, please play in the garden with Lola” and instead he stares miserably into the Abyss waiting for MIL to return and give him the life all dog owners want to give. I feel like he hates his life with us now, he’s seen that the grass is greener on the other side and thinks “why am I stuck with these people when I can go with MIL”? I mean I know he’s just a dog but I’m sure they see the difference between being with person A and person B.
