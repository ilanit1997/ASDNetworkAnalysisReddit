244,TrueOffMyChest,2023-04-23 23:10:05,thefrustratedpoet,How did nobody know I’m autistic?,"*edited the date of diagnosis… it definitely wasn’t 2032!* 

I (38f) was diagnosed with ADHD in 2021 at the age of 35. Since I got medicated, I have absolutely spiralled. I think that the ADHD was masking something deeper. I think I’m autistic. I’ve been looking through old photos, and remembering things - meltdown, shutdowns. 

I literally found a photo of myself on prom night doing t-Rex arms and looking like I had learned to smile from watching other people.

I remember my dad telling me not to smile in photos because I used to look like a clown when I smiled. I was terrible at friendship, still am, and I have never been able to manage well on my own. 

I’m sensitive, feel too much, have had lifelong gut issues, and struggle with task initiation, task switching, change. I’m in complete burnout.

Looking back on my life, I cannot fathom that anybody thought I was normal. And now I’m nearly 40 and exhausted and struggling, and unable to pursue a diagnosis, and scared that I’m just going to be broken for the rest of my life.

I can’t speak to anybody in my life about it because I just made ADHD my entire personality for 2 years. I can’t bring ANOTHER thing to my support circle. 

I’m so sad and tired and guilty and full of shame and regret. I didn’t even look for autism because of internalised ableism. And now I just get to live as an alien for the rest of my life. 

Self-diagnosis is valid, but all I can think is that a formal diagnosis would open up support.",8,25,25,0.88,0,,/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/12wtxgv/how_did_nobody_know_im_autistic/,False,True

I went down there thinking my manager was working them but as I get around one of the displays, I see my coworker in one of the displays looking at the inside from the inside.

I was reminded about a time at church where they were looking for people to run the electronics booth at church like the presentation slides and lights and what not. I signed up and I went to the first ""training"" and it was going fine til we got to the actual booth where I was told to sit to the side. I didn't argue and I thought nothing of it. I thought we were going to take turns fiddling with the light settings and what not, but then I was never called up. I think I just ended up leaving early because they never had me go up and sho me how to work everything like they did everyone else. I was the only girl and everyone else was around my age so it wasn't because I was too young. It just felt very judgemental too for the fact it seemed like they didn't think I could learn everything they were talking about.",0,2,2,0.75,0,,/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/yiynl0/i_was_reminded_why_i_dont_go_to_church/,False,True
467,TrueOffMyChest,2022-06-23 14:58:59,SpicyRamen5193,My parents probably think I'm an unloving near failure of a kid,"I (19F) haven't said 'I love you' very often since about middle school and have a minimal relationship with my parents that I won't get too into here. I used to be an amazing student who would get A's and B's in school. I struggled mentally but I still made it. High school hit and my grades began to drop a bit. I wasn't entirely concerned but my parents were, moreso over my grades than why the grades fell; I think they assume I was lazy, which I won't deny, I was to a degree. Around junior year I met a guy (23M) online and we hit it off. Everything was fine up until mistakes were made and our relationship turned sour, which also had an impact on my mental health. I will dive more into that relationship with the guy more in another post that I'd like to write. My grades began to fall due to this toxic relationship and my parents were angry. I was dating an older guy online who still lived with his parents, my grades had tanked, and I did nothing other than what I was required to do (go to school and go to work). Then covid hit and everything just increasingly got worse. Some days I would eat nothing and do nothing. I would watch anime instead of work on school. I had no energy to really do anything. My parents tried multiple times and different ways to separate me from my now ex because they knew some of my struggle was because of him, but I found ways around that. Everything just got worse and worse and it really divided me and my parents. I hated that they hated my then bf and pulled myself away from them. Fast forward to January 2021, I have decided to go to therapy because I believed I was a problem to everyone. My then bf breaks up with me because he can't handle the massive depression and insecurities he's caused me. I in turn want to commit as I felt I had nothing else to live for, he and the toxic relationship we had was all that kept me going at that point. My parents slowly figure this out and try to support me, but they don't understand that therapy isn't going to fix me immediately. I couldn't handle all the regular stressors of life and I especially couldn't handle my parents constantly nitpicking my therapist and my school work when I just wanted to die. So I moved out for a month to my friend's house across the street. This really broke my mom because I didn't tell them all what happened leading up to this, as I wasn't ready and I was still extremely angry at what they said and did while I was in this relationship. I feel very bad that I left my mom feeling like this was their fault and I regret not telling them but I plan to. My friend was my shoulder to cry on during this period and really helped stand my ground while I was going through all of this. I slowly got better and was able to pull my grades up by my bootstraps just enough to graduate. Now, I'd talked to my parents about the plan after I graduated and I was told that I would have a place to stay until I could get back on my feet mentally and financially. They at least understood that I was not ok mentally, until they didn't. After I graduated in May and moved back in, they had told me that I had until July to figure out a place to live and a job to support it. I was dumbfounded, not only had they gone back on their word but I would not have the same luxury as my 3 siblings of being able to save money and learn good spending habits before going out on my own. I felt blindsided. Luckily they told me they'd give me my mom's old car for transport if I graduated and my dad ended up allowing me to move into one of his rental properties and be one of his tenants. Still, these were big steps for me to take after being extremely depressed for god knows how long.

About a year has passed and I'm doing ok mentally and I'm in a much healthier relationship with my current bf (22M) and we are living together. He's a smoker and sometimes I feel like my parents judge me for the type of people I end up falling for. We make just enough to make ends meet but neither of us will likely pursue higher education or, at least at the moment, make much more than what we are now, especially with inflation taking over. I am the least successful out of all their children and I don't know if I will ever make more than any of them.

TLDR: I got into a toxic relationship, got the big sad, grades tanked, parents offered help and then revoked it, but now I'm better in a healthier relationship with a smoker, but really only living paycheck to paycheck while my siblings are much more successful than me and I feel like my parents are disappointed in me because of all that.

P.S. Don't tell me that I'm still young and can change my life around, I've heard it too many times and with inflation, it might actually be impossible to do very much. I am also trying to make amends with my parents.",0,0,0,0.5,0,,/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/viyvyf/my_parents_probably_think_im_an_unloving_near/,False,True
469,TrueOffMyChest,2022-06-08 14:10:49,SpicyRamen5193,I wish I was my parent's biological kid,"I (19F) am adopted from China. I've grown up in a relatively normal household and feel I was treated the same as my older siblings. I never felt like they prioritized me or gave me less attention and I was fine. I've gone through phases knowing I'm adopted, missing my bio mom and wondering why I was given up. I have come to terms with the fact I may never meet her or know why she gave me up a long time ago, but it doesn't cure my feelings of abandonment or attachment issues I have now. I've never behaved the same as the rest of my family, as I believe I am neurodivergent while they are not, and it's caused multiple misunderstandings between us. I love them but I am not attached to them like that; like if they died, I probably wouldn't cry. I wish I had that connection with all of them like a close knit family has. Sometimes I feel so alienated from them all, like I'm looking in at their life thru a window, especially when looking at very old family photos. I was with my family and extended family while looking at the family photo album and I just felt left out because I'm not their flesh and blood. I just wish I was.

1974,TrueOffMyChest,2023-02-06 05:19:40,introvertedfreak21,A funeral made me realize things I missed out on,"Tldr: I was at a funeral for my late uncle, and listening to voice-mails others have of him made me realize that I don't even remember my mom's voice or face.

So, this was a couple of years ago, it's just something that comes to mind now and again.

I'd like to say I wasn't close with this family member, he was my stepmother's brother. He had a lot of issues from an accident when he was young. He had seizures to a point that a good chunk of his brain was removed to help control them. He wasn't in a good way for a long time as he just couldn't get freedom from his family. If more detail is wanted, I'm okay providing it but this isn't really about him. He did commit suicide one night and wasn't found till the morning. Understandably, everyone was upset. I wasn't close to him but I still felt he didn't deserve to go out that way.

Well, his funeral comes. He was cremated and put in a vault with other ashes in these glass boxes that also had his picture and a few of his things. I remember this well as everyone talked about how they loved him, told stories of him, and then my stepmom played a voice-mail he left for her. That's when this feeling struck me. I had none of that with my own mom. She passed away when I was 18, I'm now 25. I wasn't close with her because she was an addict and neglected me a lot when I was young before my dad got custody. However, I still loved her, she was my mom no matter. I feel guilt for thinking about her during that funeral. I have barely any photos of her, no old voice mails. Just a few letters that read like the ramblings of a mad woman. I wish I had more than that, stuff of hers before she was too far gone. All of her things is with my half sister but I refuse to speak with her. She is an addict as well and believes my dad brainwashed me against them and that one day I'll just return when I'm free of him. She also thinks my mom's death wasn't an accidental overdose and said to me ""She just missed her baby so much"" the day I visited after her death. That still hurts to remember, no one ever wants to believe they are the reason their parent died. My dad told me she has had at least 7 overdoses and this one just happened to be fatal.

I just wanted that off my chest. Maybe there are other people who could understand this feeling of disconnect but the disgust for that half too.",1,3,3,0.8,0,,/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/10uyhy1/a_funeral_made_me_realize_things_i_missed_out_on/,False,True
2319,TrueOffMyChest,2021-07-22 18:26:10,linguisticshead,The Autism Community is not inclusive and it is not a community.,"For a bit of context – I am clinically diagnosed with autism and recently I received a ton of hate on social media for sharing some views on the autism diagnosis criteria. It seems as if people forget that having difficulties communicating is a part of being on the spectrum and you are not allowed to complain how fucking hard this is sometimes.

Autistic people with less communication skills are left out of the community. Autistic people who are nonverbal are often not given a chance to participate in a group. I have been trying to make friends in the autistic community for a long time but all I feel is that I don't belong there and that these are not my people and not the kind of activism I want to join. 

Besides trying to interact all the time with autistics on social media, the only time I was able to get their attention was by sharing on my private account an opinion that was slightly different than theirs. I got tons of hate while autistic people are legally being electrocuted in order to change their behaviour!!! I got tons of hate for sharing that I don't mind wearing the puzzle piece symbol while we are still being denied accommodations in Schools and Universities. Why isn't anybody talking about this? Why is it that the autistic community will only interact with me when I say something they don't 100% agree with, even when I am just a University student who has absolutely NO power on how the world views autism? When I am not fucking defending eugenics y'all.

Autistic people with less communication skills are left out of this community all the time, including me. Autistic people who don't agree 100% with other autistics opinions' are left out, are given hate and being ""cancelled"". Autistic people who have more difficulty with communication are not seen on social media, are not included in the groups. Because as much as we try, the autism community is only truly opened for people who can hold a conversation, for people who can share their views on things in a great way and for people who can seem more neurotypical. 

The Autism Community is not a Community. This makes me sad and upset. If this text is confusing, I am sorry, as I said, communication is hard for me and I am just truly upset with the realisation that even autistic people are not always inclusive, are not always accepting. You need to do better, we need to do better. You need to support people with less verbal skills like me and people who have more difficulty maintaining friendships like me.

M and I were each others first of everything, and I mean everything, in 8th grade around 2017 she was bored of the relationship with me and got with one of my friends now we will call C and that was that for us, she will come back later in the story.

Now at the beginning of the relationship with L, I was very immature and cheated on her once and she held it over my head for a long time although she forgave because she loved me. She had been embedded in every family cookout and event and the family loved her and her did I. Eventually it got to the point we had both our families at our house with my pops on the grill. Eventually, me being the dumb freshman I was had had enough with a stable relationship and had tried to end things with L. L did not take this lightly, as she had told my whole family and hers that I had been a manipulative and would mentally abuse her and as expected she begged for me to forgive her after I had lost everyone’s trust but I just told her to get out my face. (I have never talked to her again but she still hangs out with my little sister). 

Now at this point 2019-2020 my family had all shunned me and I spent the whole time alone in my room or at my job on some sort of pill or drink plus I was always high at all times.

Me and my bf have been planning to go to the cinema for some time now, to watch the spider verse on june 2nd.
Now, there wouldn't have been any difficulties, but yesterday, I told my parents I would be going to the cimena and they said i can't.
I got super upset and asked why, and they told me that their godson (6 M) will be graduating from kindergarten on that day and i can't go. I was visibly upset, but didn't say anything just went to my room and texted my bf that i can't go because of the kid.
I feel so stupid for not asking earlier if i could go, and had to let him down like this. 
And i know we can go later, but i feel even more upset, because before we got together, a year ago he asked me out on a date but i friendzoned him, and now, even tho we're together i feel like i let him down the same way, because finally after such a long time, and after i realized my mistakes we started dating. And him asking if we could go to the cinema after all that made me feel so good, but i had to let him down again. I feel so stupid. Idk what to do. I know we could go later, but i still feel so dumb, since we would have to wait another week for it, and it wouldn't have happened if i just asked earlier. I feel like i let him down the same way i did last year and i feel so guilty for it.

I’ve been having problems with how I feel about both of them but mostly of my father. Me and him have some tension between us because of how different we like to spend are time.  The main concern right now is about my dog who my parents have been having problems over. the main problem happened 3 hours ago at 11:00pm me and my sibling 19y sis 17y sis  and 13 y brother and mom are going on a trip to go to my mom’s side of the family trip together. The problem is that we needed to drop off the dog at my dads because that was the plan all along and my dad knew or should have known that. Unfortunately my dad refused the dog coming over which I did not know this until I was at his house with my dog. He start yelling saying not to bring the dog in the house and saying to leave with the dog now.(my mom drove me over and was in the car) he started filming the interaction for some reason and I was being told by my mom to get in the car and just leave my dog ( ember ) outside (because my dad was outside) and leave. But I was scared because I think he might have just left her out their if just left and we live near a road that cars go fast on so if she got hit she would probably die. He told be “ if you leave her here  then we will have some major issues.” I was crying at this point (I’m pretty sensitive and don’t like getting yelled at) and I was just begging my mom to just take the dog home and just see if we can find someone but my mom said no finally she relented and called my sister boyfriend to ask if he could watch ember and he said yes. On the way home I was bawling my eyes out and I was mad at both of my parents for me being in the middle alone in this just thinking that if I choose one Side I will ruin the other relationship.

I was drinking every day and night and digging myself a deeper and deeper hole into addiction. I dabbled in magic mushrooms a little bit before in my life and one night I figured I’d try doing some alone. Boyyyy, I ended up having a bad trip ( and at the time I thought) the worst night of my life. I went on this weird psychedelic journey through my own head and I told myself things like “I wasn’t worth anything “ or I “don’t deserve happiness”. I thought I saw God and angels and demons… and I’m not religious. This lasted for seven hours and I thought that it was just a bad trip, but afterwards I felt extremely different. It was like my whole mindset on life changed overnight. I began slowing down my drinking, and I stopped smoking as much weed. I started applying myself more at work. I began looking deep into myself and I was actually able to commit for the very first time in my life to my general well-being and happiness. I can dream again, and I have a clear head now. I can actually take a look at myself and see what I am. 

Now I’m not saying “Everybody should go out and eat too many mushrooms!”, but I do feel like it opened a whole new door in my life. I’m happy again. I don’t drink. I don’t smoke marijuana. I stopped worrying so much about my recent breakup. I’m currently in the best place in my life. I don’t attribute it all to that one night, but I swear that my mindset changed for the better, and that’s what is important. Thanks for letting me share Reddit.

The first day, it was pretty cool because I could buy alcohol and cigarettes and I really did feel more grown-up than I did the day before.

No one even asked for my ID while buying anything and I was happy about it but at the same time felt kinda stupid because then it got to the point where I was like: Did I even need to turn 18 to buy alcohol?

My birthday was fun at least, for the most part, and all of my friends were really excited for me and the opportunities my new-found maturity showed (I am older than the rest by a couple of months)

But now it’s kind of faded. If anything, I still feel like a 15 year old. Yesterday, I went to buy cigarettes and was genuinely worried whether they’d ask me for ID until I realized that it doesn’t matter. If they did, I could just show it.

I no longer had to take my older sister’s ID to buy the age-restricted things, nor did I have to ask her to get them for me.

I’m supposed to go open a bank account next week, and although I could have done it this week I didn’t want to because I would have had to do it alone. I’ve just been waiting for my mom’s schedule to clear up so she can go with me.

For context my mom passed away when i was 4 and my dad isn't really in my life so i was raised by his family. His brother whom i have come around to call papa (unmarried), my aunt (unmarried) and my grandpa. My dad's family never really liked my mom's though they hold conversations and are civil with each other. My parents eloped and married against the wishes of the both families so I guess their under lying hostility for each other makes sense. 

What's so arguably toxic and draining living all these years with them is that though they look after me and treat me relatively well compared to others perhaps who are in the same scenario as me is that whenever i have an opinion against theirs beliefs/actions or when i do something that doesn't seem to make them happy i get called "" don't act like your mother's family and become the bad blood like them"". ""bad blood"" in this scenario is pretty derogatory as if my mother and her family isn't normal humans like any other. I have been hearing this as long as i can remember and though over the years i have come to act as if it doesn't bother me anymore i still feel unwanted when it happens. I haven't felt wanted all this years of my life that I have been living honestly. It always seems like an underlying message of "" we gave up on our own personal lives to raise you so you better make it worth."" Whenever i do something that makes them feel that isn't the best choice or action to do by their perspective i hear pretty awful remarks by them. It can range from "" we are raising you up just because that's what your dying mother wish was"", "" ofcourse you are like any other dumb child, you after all carry your mother's blood in your veins"" to ""We don't care whatever you do, you aren't ours anyways."" I know compared to the awful physical and mental trauma that many live through mine seems almost miniscule and unimportant, I'm in no way ungrateful for the fact they are raising a child that isn't their own but it always doesn't make me feel the best. 

I suffered from unaliving tendencies and SH from age 11-18 because i couldn't deal with all these remarks. Added with the being a perfect kid who gets perfect marks that i had to keep up maintaining because if I didn't i would feel extremely anxious and guilty i fell into depression . (I have been clean for the past one year which I'm very proud of) and had to seek therapy outside their knowledge. They don't really believe that one can suffer from mental health problems. Added with the 2020-2022 covid era my mental health and grades tanked and i felt more isolated that ever. Such taunts, arguments and remarks increased along with some strain in the family dynamics as my granpa started showing signs of dementia then and it affected me a lot. I have been better since then and I'm doing well but things get hard some days and today was one of them so I thought maybe I should get it off my chest here. At the end of each day I'm thankful for the relatively good life that i lead and for all the opportunities it presents but their words never makes to fail me realise that I'm not really wanted anywhere and that them raising isn't something that they chose to do but something that had to given the past circumstances.

And how lovely it was to be in love. I only wish one day they come back with the same feelings. Till then, I'll sit here and think of them. I don't even actively think of them. It comes in flash backs. It even occurs in dreams. I may be obsessed. I might need closure, or maybe my feelings are strong. Whatever it is, dear ex, I hope for you to heal, whether you come back to me or choose to move on. I love you. And I always have.

159,TrueOffMyChest,2023-05-27 09:56:49,LexaLovegood,I just want an apology.,"Context. I guess. I 30s f am the youngest of 4. My mom was pretty tired by the time she had me and my dad left when I was like 8 with LC until I finally NC at 19.

Yes I look back now and admit that I was a bit spoiled. My parents worked so they could provide with what we needed and after it was just me mom and 1 sibling. she did spoil me a bit because I was heart broken. I was a daddy's girl to no end. 

Now my older 3 siblings had it a bit rough. I don't know much besides what I've gotten out of my mom because it was rough for her too. But besides some unfortunate major incidents I remember our life being decent. But I always remember one siblings (we will call her M) having issues. 

M was and is a bit of perfectionist. She always had to match her clothes. Her hair and makeup had to be right. Me on the other hand I would just grab and put on whatever. I was always a tomboy and she was our moms girly girl. That never ended well. So our lives were to me at the time just sibling issues. But as I've gotten older and started processing my own issues I realized alot of them come from M. She was my biggest bully. 

I've accepted that she had her own demons she was fighting at the time and probably seen me as golden child while to me that was our older siblings. But somedays when I'm not doing so good and struggling I just want her to say I'm sorry. I'm sorry I hurt you because I was hurting. I know that will never happen. But I feel like it's something I need. I unfortunately do not have a therapist atm and am working through my issues myself. I wish we had a better relationship but I can't change the past and can only look towards the future to hopefully get better. 


If you read this far thanks. I don't expect anyone to read this. I just needed to say it.",0,4,4,1.0,0,,/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/13t3cu3/i_just_want_an_apology/,False,False
160,TrueOffMyChest,2023-05-27 09:56:16,Odd_Volume9689,I got fired for being assaulted at work but apparently one of the managers (who did end up getting fired) was telling people that I was getting fired for being a bad worker,"I'm frustrated because the separation reason on my termination letter was misconduct because they said I initiated getting assaulted by throwing two cans away in the only open trash can. Day of, the other manager told me she understood why I threw the cans away in the only open trash can (because it was the only open trash can), but two weeks later I got fired over getting assaulted over it because they insinuated that I started it. My paperwork says I got fired for misconduct, but another manager was telling people that I got fired for being a bad worker. This manager had never given me any actionable advice and was constantly telling me that maybe I should quit until I got HR involved, and then she left me alone, but when things came to a head I think she jumped at the opportunity to get rid of me. 
The issue is the paperwork says I got fired for misconduct. If I was just fired for being a ""bad worker"", I would be able to file for unemployment in my state, but they explicitly said misconduct,  so I've had to liquidate my savings in order to job hunt and I still don't have money left over for rent so I'm frustrated and angry because I did everything they asked me to and I still got screwed over for it.

161,TrueOffMyChest,2023-05-27 09:47:29,Sufficient-College55,I made out with my current boyfriend when he was seeing someone else,"
I am from a culture that views dating as a monogamous venture, as in dating one person at a time. 

I met my boyfriend through a mutual friend and some of us went drinking at a bar. I found him really hot when I met him for the first time the day before we went drinking and asked my friend if he was single. 
My friend said “Technically yes, but maybe no. He went on a date with a girl few days ago” - I had decided I wouldn’t interfere and only wanted to see him as a friend. Cut to the next day - he was looking insanely gorgeous and attractive and I obviously felt a stirring in my heart whenever he was standing next to me. 

My friends saw the sexual tension between us and we were all buzzed. They cheered on us to kiss on a dare and we started making out, and now we are in a serious relationship and looking forward to marrying each other in a few years. 

Lmao I never thought I’d be the “other” woman. However he is the sweetest guy ever and before we officially went on our first date, he made sure to end things with the other girl. 

I know it probably hurt her but I would do it again if it means I have him all to myself.",1,0,0,0.5,0,,/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/13t37f1/i_made_out_with_my_current_boyfriend_when_he_was/,False,False
162,TrueOffMyChest,2023-05-27 09:42:08,One-Letterhead-58,I am sad I didnt finish High School,"I was forced to drop out at 15, by my father. I got my GED, I thought I was okay with it. But now ever since the people my age started graduating my heart hurts. I see posts of them at prom, of them at their graduations, photos of them saying goodbye to their teachers talking about how much they meant to them and it fucking sucks. I didnt get to go to prom, hell even before I dropped out I had never been to a school dance. Now I will never get that chance. All those memories everyone got to make at school I missed out on. High School is supposed to be the best time of a teenagers life and I missed it all. I know its not my fault, I had no choice but damn it, it fucking hurts.

163,TrueOffMyChest,2023-05-27 09:33:05,nothxdood,Coworker called me ugly,"Not sure why. I'm about average as far as looks go. 

She's going through some stuff so I suspect it has more to do with her feelings about herself - either that or she's got a big gay crush on me and isn't ready to deal with it so instead wanted to insult me, either that or she's jealous.

Maybe I was too nice to her (she didn't have food and I gave her some, twice, and I helped train her in when she was new and gave her advice about some life stuff) and she resents me for it so now she's being mean? I don't know. I've heard her on the phone at work insulting boyfriends / potential boyfriends so it seems to just be her personality. I regret putting in so much effort to help her out now though and I will probably be keeping more of a distance in the future.",2,3,3,1.0,0,,/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/13t2z53/coworker_called_me_ugly/,False,False
164,TrueOffMyChest,2023-05-27 09:27:54,Throwaway-exfriend65,I want an ex friend come back.,"*english isnt my first language so i’m sorry if i worded some stuff wrong*

me(16F) and a close friend of mine(16F) had a big fight about a month ago. It was me who started it because almost our entire friendship she doesn’t text me or talk to me unless i talk to her first, i’ve brought it up twice before we had the fight, i’m not the only one she fought with or had a problem with, alot of her friends also have a problem with that i think.
we would go days without speaking if i don’t reach out first. and if i do, she would take hours to an entire day to respond with a one word message, 2 words if im lucky. 
A mutual friend of ours is on my side, telling me i should ignore her because she’s being incredibly weird and she doesn’t know how to act, the said mutual friend also says that she always texts her, its what convinced me i was being ignored.
After that i started ignoring her. I wouldn’t talk to her or look at her and it lasted for about 2 weeks, and in those 2 weeks she never talked to me in person or online. I blocked her on insta and she never noticed, and there were two instances where she saw me and turned the other way.
Two days before the fight she came up to me and hugged me out of nowhere, telling me that she dreamed that i talked to her, that she wanted to talk but can’t think of anything to say and that she’d speak to me after the weekend in school, the school day came up and she didn’t come to me at all.
in the fight i asked why she never speaks to me and that i always reach out first and that we’ve talked about this before. She says that shes always tired and that she has problems at home, ok understandable. I said that if she had just told me we wouldnt have these problems. She then says that she doesn’t have to tell me, and says that she’s fought with other people about this issue and that the ones who understand, understand. And the ones who don’t can fuck off.
Now every now and then she gives me looks and thats all. she would text my best friend saying that she wants to talk to me but she doesn’t. Just a few days ago she texted my best friend again saying she wants to make up, and that she can’t bring herself to talk to me when she looks at me. My best friend tells her again that im ignoring her because of how hurt i was.
i don’t want to be the one who reaches out, i’m always the one who texts first or reaches out. I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t even know WHY i want her to come back after this entire mess",0,1,1,0.99,0,,/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/13t2w20/i_want_an_ex_friend_come_back/,False,False
165,TrueOffMyChest,2023-05-27 09:17:29,battleshipfued,Saw something unsettling today,"Okay so I can't sleep and this has thrown me off all day. Was going to get groceries with my husband, as we are walking to the car in our complex we were approching the stairs we saw a young sister (maybe about 5) and her younger brother (about 2) climbing the stairs together. Something looked very off and as we were getting closer we realized the boy had no underwear or pants on. He was fully exposed and his sister was trying to take him somewhere. My first thought was what the hell? These kids must me lost, why isn't the child wearing anything outside of the house? Why are they alone?

I immediately stopped, asked my husband to go to the car and wait for me while i ask the sister where her parents are and where her apt is so I can escort these kids to privacy. She did not speak English but pointed at her brother and said his name. She wearing traditional clothing. For context I live in the USA and there is a good amount of immigrants in our complex but I had a hunch these kids were from Afghanistan because of their clothing and names, I'm middle eastern and tried saying Arabic words but she didn't understand either. I noticed the apartment they wanted to go to has a huge Afghanistan flag in one of the rooms that I glimsped one day roaming around. The sister seemed pleased to talk to me but we couldn't communicate. The boy seemed distracted and started going down the opposite way and they both looked away and I immediately went down stairs and found their mother. 

Their mother was in traditional clothing, fully covered, and couldn't speak English, I asked if she was from Afghanistan and she nodded, she was smiling and looking extremely weird and soulless. At that point I assumed she was a refugee. She was roaming around far away from her kids and seemed like she gave zero shits when I brought up that her son is naked and he needs to wear something and it's not safe for a child to be like that in public. After a while the Convo was going nowhere and I felt unsettled cos she wasn't doing anything and I made the choice to leave her be. 

I have never seen something like this before, I live in a very hot state during the summer and even then I've never seen a very young child a exposed in such a way IN PUBLIC while people walk around the complex midday, anyone can see him and his mom didn't care. It made me think something deeply wrong is happening in their household and that poor child has no sense of privacy. The mother was fully covered but didn't bother to cover her kid?? Is this shit common in afghan culture? Have u ever seen something like this? I felt so horrible for that kid and I felt like I should have done more but I was honestly too shaken and I did what I could. I don't have kids but I care a lot about child safety and this disturbed me given how many messed up people are out there.",8,6,6,1.0,0,,/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/13t2q4r/saw_something_unsettling_today/,False,False
