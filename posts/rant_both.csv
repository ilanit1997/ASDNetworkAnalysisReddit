Tired of quarantines and people who have politicized this virus. I'm tired of getting up at 7, monitoring my sons online school until noon. Then going to work. Getting home at 8 or 10. Immediately going to work feeding animals and doing chores. By the time I can sit down I am too fried to enjoy anything.

I love my kids but they pester me relentlessly. My wife is very negative and I have depression so it constantly drags me down.

No moment of my life feels like it is ever about me. I'm dragging at work because I'm just so exhausted.

We did not have a good relationship. 

I still live in same town as it was only place I could really get but we do not bump into each other which is great. Although today, thankfully it wasn't my ex though, but his mum. I was waiting to get on bus, headphones on and trying hard to focus on what I had to do and not freak out (I'm a terrible traveller at best of time) then someone smacks me on the arm. I kind of freeze cause someone just touched me and I am not okay with someone touching me, but I eventually turned round to her. I have no recollection of what she said, I just know my face was horrified and I have no idea if I managed to get a word out to her. I think she was just saying it had been a long time since she saw me or something along those lines but in what sense did I give vibe I wanted anyone talking to me.

She understands lots of people like D&D, Star Wars, knows about going to conventions in cosplay. Yet somehow she doesn't seem to grasp the idea of making props for fun. She does tell me to sell them  but honestly, I get very little attention on Etsy and I do this to help me unwind. If I do it for a job, then it's not a fun hobby.

1991,rant,2021-08-30 03:21:54,introvertedfreak21,The though of seeing my dad makes me have a panic attack,"I'm not really sure if this is really my dad being a narcissist or just he's not right in the head anymore.

About a year ago, my dad just suddenly started having seizures, we found out it was because of a blockage in his heart. But he had so many that I feel like its done too much damage. I try to understand that but its just one those things I can't get over.

My sister and step mom notice it too. For me, any time he wants to try to get his way with me(I.e. if he insists on calling me while I'm at work and I just can't call) he will use a guilt trip. Its normally something about ""You are my only kid."" He has raised two daughters, I'm just the only one by blood. ""You are the last of my bloodline."" He actually has a son by another woman, just they don't talk. ""It will always be just you and me."" That one always pisses me off. That's not a life I want, I have a partner who has been with me through thick and thin for the last five years, he will never not be in my life.

Other examples are stuff like when talking to him, its like he's not listening. He'll repeat his point again at you, like you didn't hear him the first time. One time we were eating at a restaurant and he just suddenly started talking about something we talked about hours ago.

He's also just irresponsible now, he keeps mixing Xanax with alcohol. I know, it's literally the one thing any one would tell you not to do. They aren't even his, they are for my stepmom who has an anxiety disorder. He also likes to help out his friends all the time without talking to his wife. He also talks about divorcing her all the time but I don't think he should. Any woman willing to put with all that form him really does love him.

I needed to vent about these things because ever since I moved out in December of 2020, He's gotten worse about bothering me. He just can't seem to understand that I live my own life now, I can't just drop by whenever he wants me too nor do I like him just dropping by unacounced. He'll always be my dad but he just isn't half the man he once was to me. I also just get annoyed because he's pushing anyone away that isn't me even though the literal day before I moved out, he left a note and just up and left us all. I saw how badly it broke my step mom's heart, we had no idea where he went or if he was okay. I had to be the one to beg my grandma to tell me if she knew where he was and tell her all the things he's been doing to his own family. He tried to apologize for all of that but I told him I wouldn't forgive him till he got therapy. He never did and I still try to keep my distance.

But distance these days is more for my own well being. I had a panic attack at work. It wasn't really caused by one thing, it was just a very stressful few weeks that hit me all at once. Now that I know the feeling, the thought of seeing my dad brings that up in me. Every time he calls me drunk feels me with dread. Every time he just texts me out of the blue to talk more about his paranio stuff, my throat gets tight. All the ""Will you do me a favor?"" Just drives me nuts. This is all stuff that just came up in the last few years as his health has been in decline and he's not in the right state of mind. I struggle with the debate in my mind to cut him off. I want to just keep him at arms length but its hard because he claws at breaking that boundary all the time, begging for that family bond that isn't there.

Whether you‚Äôre on X end or Y end of the political spectrum, a transphobe or an ally, etc‚Ä¶. Thinking that way is just going to piss off everyone on either side of the trans debate.

I fall on the ally end of the spectrum and hate seeing people who are typically oppressed hypocritically turn around and treat others the same way they don‚Äôt want to be treated.

108,rant,2023-05-27 04:19:34,kiwilovethekiwis,I have a problem with my transgender partners,"I have a problem with my transgender partner. More than just my partner, I have a problem with the community itself. I‚Äôm not here to get into the politics of why I dislike transgenderism, i‚Äôm here to tell my story of why I struggle to date anyone who identifies as trans. I have had three girlfriends so far, all of which identify with he/him pronouns. For a lesbian, this is one of the most frustrating things to have to deal with in relationships. As a lesbian, I would like a girlfriend, and nothing other than a girlfriend. I want to tell people I have a girlfriend, I want to talk about girl things, I want to be with someone who can really get deep with me emotionally and understand how I‚Äôm feeling. And any lesbian would know that no guy could ever understand a woman‚Äôs feelings as much as another woman. Now, I‚Äôm all for a total feminine woman as a partner. I do enjoy the raw vibes and energy of a traditionally feminine woman as much as the next guy. But a bit of masculinity is what I find the most appealing. However, nowadays, you wouldn‚Äôt believe how difficult it is to find a raw energy, semi-masculine woman in our society that‚Äôs still values the entirety of being a woman. Nowadays, young girls are brought up to be confused about their gender identity. As they go through puberty, an age which they are most confused and uncomfortable about their bodies at, they are told that if you just transition or change your gender identity using pronouns then all of your problems and discomfort will go away. This is what they are taught and I have seen this in so many young women. It has gotten so bad that the only women that are semi-masculine and desirable to me as partners are those who call themselves boys and use he/him pronouns. These are the more semi-masculine women who still keep their femininity, exactly what I desire. I have dated three of these women and all three of them, right before our relationship ended, have asked me the same question; ‚ÄúDo you see me as a boy?‚Äù When I hear this question I know the relationship is about to go down south. I have given three separate answers to this question, and all three attempts of saving the futile relationship have failed in the same dramatic ways. And every time a new relationship fails, it hurts worse than the last. It got so bad the third time when my partner completely lost her mind after I told her the truth, I didn‚Äôt see her as a boy. She sought revenge for the rest of that year until I finally graduated from high school. She tried to take my friends away, ruin my future relationships, And even go as far as to attempt to destroy a major art project I had been building for months in the metal shop out of spite. Luckily she was apprehended by my teacher before she could destroy it. But it was after our relationship that I finally decided I would never date another trans person for the sake of side stepping around the drama and the hurt. Each relationship I had with a trans person went wonderfully for the first few months or so. But in each relationship I had either slipped up or directly told my partner that I was a lesbian. The times I directly told my partners were the times I had trusted and hoped they would be civil enough to have a conversation about our identities. And typically there would be no issue between us for another few months or so as our day to day relationship continued as normal. This is until my partners decide to bring up my forbidden sexuality once again, close to the end of our relationship. They talk about how my being a lesbian is ‚Äúoppressing‚Äù them and making them feel like I don‚Äôt value their gender identity as much as they would like me to. Keep in mind, the only time I had ever brought up the fact that I was a lesbian was at the very beginning of our relationships. ONLY at the very beginning. I would never bring it up for the rest of our time together because I knew how sensitive these transgenders were about their identities. The only times my being a lesbian was brought up was by them in order to create conflict. These were the women that I would most frequently fall in love with. They were women that I valued their character and personality over, over any sort of gender identity they were recognized as in society. I loved each one from the bottom of my heart and made it my biggest initiative to treat each one like the center of my world. That‚Äôs how much I valued these women as my partners. Without their transgenderism or gender identity confusion, any of those three women could have been my partners for life if everything else flowed smoothly. That is my problem with transgenderism, the transgender community, and my transgender partners. I vowed from this point on to never date another trans person for the rest of my life to avoid the hardships that came with it. And so far, I have been ‚Äúsober‚Äù in that sense for the last two months‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶up until‚Ä¶

I met this girl. And yup‚Ä¶she‚Äôs trans‚Ä¶
