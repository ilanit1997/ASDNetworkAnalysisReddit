1128,Dreams,2022-12-23 11:29:13,FlamingPhoenix24,Lucid dreaming memory,"Does anyone else have trouble accessing your full memory of the waking world while lucid dreaming? I just had a lucid dream where I was interacting with coworkers, but I couldn't remember for the life of me if I still work with one of them or not. Upon waking, it was obvious that I still do, but my level of awareness seemed to be the same before and after waking so why couldn't I remember this one specific detail?",0,2,2,1.0,0,,/r/Dreams/comments/ztd395/lucid_dreaming_memory/,False,True
1130,Dreams,2022-10-07 14:16:23,FlamingPhoenix24,Seemingly prophetic dream,"I am sharing this dream partially for help with interpretation and partially to have a record in case it is predicting something important, we will know I didn't write it after the fact or try to change it. I suspect if anything it is something for me personally, but you never know. I'm usually pretty good at interpreting dreams, especially my own, but this one is stumping me a bit. Any insight would be helpful.

10/07/22 6:57am

The sky went pitch black. The moon appeared, full and shining. 6 stars glowed around it, then went dim. Then 12 starts glowed around it, then went dim. The moon turned to the dark side and was completely black but still visible. A map of the earth appeared on its slightly brighter surface, with Italy glowing bright gold. The rest of the map was black and gray. I thought to myself, ""is she from there?"" I didn't know who I was thinking of. In the dream, I tried to write these things down in my phone, but when I opened it there was text automatically pasted. It said, ""Counting the days of the goths, beware the woman of the east."" Then I woke up.

Some of my current thoughts:

The phrase ""the goths"" sounded odd to me. I thought it was referring to the modern style goth and because of this sillyness I almost didn't record the dream, but I felt compelled to. I did some research after this and found out the goths were a people. They had something to do with the fall of the western Roman empire, which seems relevant due to the highlighting of Italy in my dream. Also ""from the east"" could that be referring to Italy? Typically I don't think of Europe as from the east, but it is east from my location. I thought at first of the current protests for women's rights in the Middle East, but the text said ""woman"" not ""women"" so perhaps that is unrelated. Maybe Italy/Rome is symbolic of the US? I don't know. I just wanted to share some of my thoughts to provide a starting point. I also don't know how the moon and starts factor in, but perhaps that part could provide some context to the rest. Let me know what you all think.",10,11,11,0.93,0,,/r/Dreams/comments/xy0avr/seemingly_prophetic_dream/,False,True

I can usually interpret my dreams fairly well and draw easy patterns to recent events, memories on my mind, subconscious things I might be processing. But this one came out of nowhere. Maybe just random bits of imagination firing away in my sleep? Can anyone attest?

For information: pre-bed dinner was a quesadilla and hot dogs. I always eat very late and I tend to prefer carbs specifically so my dreams are more vivid and I have better control over them, and a more active imagination the next day, so it's likely that has something to do with it.

1198,Dreams,2022-08-21 03:34:09,The_Teacat,Anxiety after strange disneyland dream.,"I dream a lot. Vivid visualisations and lucid dreaming come easy for me, so my dreams tend to be nearly-complete (if slightly strange) storylines in my head, usually like small movies or layered dreams, and while they're all mostly different and rarely even feature me at all, there are some recurring elements that have formed into their own little dreamscapes or nightly anthologies.

(Yes, I have a lot of dreaming practice. It's a very important skill for me to cultivate.)

One major element is Disneyland. I dream about different parts of an alternate version of it, different sections each time but always the same alternate version of it.

I've never dreamed about entering the park, though. Now I have, and it...did not go well.

The entryway ticket booths here are now in an enclosed room, like a security checkpoint at a small airport, and you have to run your bags through an x-ray scanner while they check your ticket like one too.

But my ticket wasn't working for some reason. My bag got stuck until they could verify the ticket, and I couldn't leave back out the front until they were sure who I was either, so I told my family to go on ahead while he fuddled with my ticket and I'd catch up when it was all settled.

Only, I eventually fell asleep in the ticket line. When I woke up, it was just past 10 at night and the park was still open but closing very soon.

He tried my ticket a few more times, my bag is still stuck, and finally, they call security, a team of two women and one man, who show up and take me to what looks like a dank kennel beside the bank on main street. I think things are going well, but the man leaves and when he comes back, he's holding a taser and they say I'm going to get tased so can I please stand still, and put a ""hot pad"" on my head, which looks like a defibrillator pad mixed with a blood pressure testing wrap. They tell me it'll hurt worse with it but it's harmless, and he tases me and I get knocked to the ground, my jaw clenched, and not least of all, I can feel this horrible burning pressure at the top of my head where I guess the pad must've absorbed the tase or something.

Anyway, I've never been tased but my dreams are as vivid as they come, so I can feel every inch of it and it hurts like hell. He tases me again before finally letting me go, and I'm able to walk back to the front gate. Management's waiting there for me with the ticket taker guy, and they're all still figuring out what to do with me, since it's just past 11 now and I can't leave until they let me in, and I'm just trying to figure out why the hell they had to tase me to figure that much out.

Manager and the ticket guy joke that I'm ""like that Tom Hanks movie where he gets trapped in an airport"". The Terminal; but I'm not laughing. It's late. My family's gone. And I'm stuck at the front gates of Disneyland for something I didn't do and no one can figure it out.

Yeah. Just like that Tom Hanks movie.",1,4,4,0.84,0,,/r/Dreams/comments/wtpiwk/anxiety_after_strange_disneyland_dream/,False,True
1986,Dreams,2022-01-13 05:15:35,introvertedfreak21,Ever had a dream that felt too real to be a dream?,"So, last night I had a dream that had really stuck with me, even now that its late in the day. The dream felt too vivid, too graphic to be something I haven't seen or heard. Consider this a warning as that dream is graphic and mentions things some may find unsettling.



Now that the warning is there, I shall describe the dream.

It was like I was watching a tv show but there was no TV I was looking at. Like I was simply watching this older man who is a teacher. I could feel the wicked intentions he had in his heart, the unsettling things he wanted to do to children. He had volunteer to be a chaperone for a overnight field trip for his school. Its pretty hazy what happened on the trip until it was night time. The man finally seemed to be losing control over his urges, I knew what he wanted to do and only hoped it wouldn't happen.

He went to the boy's area, where the young boys were all sleeping. I'm not sure exactly why, but he thought it best to climb through a window, going so far as to remove the whole glass window itself. However, he was unaware that the window was a recent admin. Things are going to become graphic now.

As he climbed through the window and landed on the ground, a large clunk of the window pane broke off and stabbed straight into his back, closer to his right shoulder. It was not a small piece, blood was pushing it's way out his body around the wound. His screams woke up the boys but they were all so young, they didn't know what they were seeing in the dark. He begged them to call 911 but the kids, so frightened, ran out of the room to find other adults. The man somehow was still able to move, he kept trying to get back off the floor but kept slipping on pools of his own blood. He eventually managed to get up and out the small room, desperately looking for help before he bleed out. He didn't make it far before he had passed out form blood loss. By the time EMT's arrived on the scene for the man, he was gone. He had simply died from blood loss.

Now, to me, this dream just felt very graphic. I rarely have violent dreams like that, my dream are usually around things that happened in the past for me or just really outlandishly vivid. This just feels so out of place, I don't dream such unsettling things. I remember even in my dream, I tried to look away as the man was dying. It just felt too real, like it was some new article I read or some video I briefly saw. I'm not sure.",1,3,3,0.81,0,,/r/Dreams/comments/s2rczq/ever_had_a_dream_that_felt_too_real_to_be_a_dream/,False,True
1995,Dreams,2021-08-01 14:35:51,introvertedfreak21,He appeared again,"I have posted before about this, it was the last post I had before this if anyone.wants to read it. But a short explanation is that every now and again, I have dreams with my ex in it. Usually I feel nothing at all for him, sometimes being creeped out by his presence but this time is different.

Usually when I remember the dream, its just that I am aware he was there but this time, his face was clear as day to me, I can even see it now. I'm not sure if that's how he looks now, he most of the time had really short brown hair and clean shaven face when I last saw him because he was part of the ROTC in our high school. But for some reason, in my dream he had short blonde hair and a growing in beard.

I was invited to his little brother's birthday party(he was the youngest of the family though, so don't know why that is). I could tell he looked at me with this hungry look and I felt embarrassed by it but at the same time, it felt good to be wanted. I woke up before much happen and a lot of dream is lost. I'm starting to think my brain is just using him as a distant familiar face to express something I need or am lacking. I came to this conclusion because during the summer months, my current bf has no real sex drive. While I have a very high one during those months so it causes a bit of discourse between us because I want to feel wanted and he can't fake that kind of thing. There are also problems between us two but its nothing serious and all really tie back to financial issues.

I was use to people from my past appearing in my dreams, mostly gone family members and a friend I don't speak to. An ex was more rare but I've had at least one dream every month or so that this specific ex would appear in my dreams. I have no romantic feels for him anymore, he heavily burned that bridge and I've been in a 5 year old committed relationship so it doesn't feel romantic. A lot of the dreams are of him chasing me in some kind of way, a few have been just us being friends again like we use to be before we ever dated, and some felt like he just needed to tell me something but I always got pulled away before he could.

The most recent dream I had was last night. It was just us hanging out again, doing something art related as we were both artistic people. When he turns to me and starts begging I give him another chance, telling me he misses me and all these things. I just keep saying no, that I love my bf and I don't wanna leave him. I don't know why this keeps happening, I haven't seen my ex in at least 4 years, last thing I heard about him was that he had a bad accident that shattered his left arm(he was a left-handed) at work and now he can't lift more than 20 pounds with that arm form all the messed up nerve-endings.

2993,Dreams,2022-07-22 16:40:19,MoonyGraham37,"Hanging out with Eddie Munson in my dreams, apparently…","Basically the dream went like this:
Like in Stranger Things, Eddie Munson was on the run for ??? but he was innocent. I don’t remember there being a threat of Vecna but I also can’t remember who else was around so who knows.
Apparently Eddie or someone had a grandma that could hide Eddie, so we all piled in a red car to go there. I volunteered to sit in the middle of the backseat because I wanted to sit next to Eddie (he was on my left side), but I didn’t make that part obvious. I remember the whole ride I wanted to hold his hand or give him some sort of contact and I was really trying to talk myself into doing it.
We had to stop somewhere (maybe a gas station?) to get something and again I volunteered to stay in the car with Eddie (since he couldn’t go in because he’s a wanted man). When everyone was gone, we kinda just vibed in the car together. There was a skylight or a overhead window and we were picking out shapes in the clouds (I think I found a hedgehog but he found a cloud that definitely had giraffe spots). During this, I plucked up enough courage to lean my arm against his and I remember just feeling really safe in that moment.
And then I woke up lmao

I know how Eddie got there - I have a friend that I kinda can’t stop thinking about that reminds me a lot of Eddie Munson, plus Stranger Things/Eddie Munson is everywhere right now, so that explains that. And the thought of plucking up the courage to hold this specific friend’s hand in a car was something I had thought about the day before, so that makes sense.

A big mafia boss and his boys (gang) are the back of a limo and the boys are taking some new drug with strange effects. (The boss is actually Tony Soprano but if you don’t know him just think of him as any mafia boss it doesn’t matter. Also the drug is made up and has imaginary effects that real drugs don’t have.).. when they take it they say they feel as though they are tiny.

He scolds them for even asking him, and they say sorry and continue without him. Even their business associate Nicola is taking it. She is sad Tony isn’t taking it because she’s always had a crush on him and wants to seem him have fun. He has never looked at her romantically however and refers to her only for work. 

One of the more mischievous gang members has the idea to spike Tony’s drink when he’s not looking. He manages to pull it off, and waits. After a short while, Tony takes a sip of his drink, and then shrinks down to tiny level. He’s having fun. He isn’t much annoyed because he’s amazed at it. However some ugly looking mosquito starts trying to attack him, and his tiny body can’t fend it off. Suddenly the mosquito is punched and destroyed by another bug. It’s a little green shield bug looking thing. Tony looks at it in amazement. He has never been protected before, he was always the one doing the protecting. He wants to hug the bug. However the bug starts talking, and reveals that it’s actually Nicola in small form. Tony withdraws when he realises it’s her. But then she saves his life again, and he can’t resist being friendly towards her. They are having such fun together in small form, and they keep taking the drug to stay that way.

While dreaming my girlfriend woke me up sexually, but then once she was finished I ran to my laundry room because I thought I heard my washing machine flooding. It was, so of course I started laying towels down when suddenly I heard my garage door open and I saw a group of about 4 men standing next to their car. I told my girlfriend about the people in the garage and she went out there and was so calm about it. I told her to call 911 because when I tried to my phone wouldn’t connect to dispatch. As I was trying to call 911, I realized all the lights in the house were off and wouldn’t turn on. So I went to the breaker and started flipping the switches to no avail. While doing this, I heard 2 other men trying to open my front door. So I ran to my bedroom and grabbed my rifle and kept telling my girlfriend to call 911. 

After I grabbed my rifle I went back towards my front door and shot off about 10 rounds but they all missed and he kept coming in. I ran back into my room and was followed by these guys and then they started pistol whipping me. 

Next thing I know I’m at some house with them and my girlfriends sister was there telling me, “I’ve had dreams like this, you just have to let it play out” many other things occurred during this dream that were just off the wall. 

However, I kept trying to wake myself up and couldn’t. I’ve always been able to wake myself up. But this dream scared me so bad.

I get a lot of nightmares often due to PTSD from Afghanistan and being a police officer. But I normally know I’m having a nightmare and either wake myself up or control the dream a little. But I just couldn’t do it this time.

203,Dreams,2023-05-27 08:22:51,Cyanide850,Elrditch deity spoke to me,"I dreamt I was deep in some woods. It was sunset. There was a huge cabin, more akin to a guest house, next to a lake. The lake had dried, leaving a muddy goop where there once was water.

Me and some other people were watching the mud on the dock that went into the lake. We thought something was hiding in there.

Someone else came over, telling us to stop fooling around and get back to the house. As soon as they left, though, we all saw a giant fish-like head emerge from the mud only to quickly sink back in. We looked at each other stunned. For some reason I knew what would happen tonight.

I went to the house. I thought that I should warn everyone else there, but I didn't, for some reason. Maybe I was worrying only about myself or thinking they wouldn't believe me. I wandered the maze of a house until night soon arrived.

I knew I had to get out of there. I left the house, turned on the flashlight on my phone and ran away into the woods. I didn't make it very far. My light started to dim and I heard noises all around me. I ran back to the house.

When I got there, I saw a handful of people surrounded by monsters, I suppose. Those same monsters came up behind me and I was forced in with the other people in the center. We were all surrounded. There was someone heavily injured on the dock. Everyone else must have been dead by then.

I didn't get a clear look of the creatures surrounding us, but angler fish come to mind - large mouths with sharp teeth and big bulging eyes. They were approaching us until they suddenly stopped.

Something happened then. We were elsewhere. The ground had changed into this slimy fleshy texture, covered in veins, tendrils and puddles of dark liquid. The sky was full of giant tubes made of meat with strange stars behind them. Everything was in shades of violet and purple.

The deity was also there, floating in the sky.

It's hard to describe the thing. It's body shape was humanoid, but it had no face. It looked as if you'd asked an AI to generate a human made out of only H.R.Gieger art. It carried what looked like a scythe made of flesh. The blade though, true to Gieger's style, looked more phallic than an actual weapon.

I think I screamed at it to stop this and return everyone who had died. It responded then. I wish I remembered it's response word for word, it seemed important. From what I can remember though, it went something like:

""What's happened has happened. There is nothing you can do to change that. The only thing you can do is accept it and continue moving forward.""

It was then that it made the injured person on the dock begin to go through some kind of transformation. He grew longer limbs, his skin tore as his insides bloated and blades came out of his spine and other body parts. His eyes turned white and he began to salivate heavily as he stood up. (Think human to necromorph transformation)

I think I fell to my knees.

I don't remember what happened to the rest of us. Maybe the deity made us all transform into similar abominations as well. That or the monsters around us resumed their advance and killed us. Not sure what would have been the better option in this situation.

The thing is I had seen that exact afterlife in my previous dreams. I am quite sure about it although I can't remember the exact dream.

So last night I was dreaming being on a huge ship with almost everybody I knew or had seen during my life. I didn't realize this until close to dying. We were on some kind of parkour course and our job was to escape some other people who tried to get us. If we got caught, we would become the hunters and tried to catch the remaining runners. I escaped with my friends but then one of the hunters shoot me with a bow (which was maybe a fake one because it didn't hurt at all and I didn't die from it). After being caught I began catching the remaining runners with other hunters. I chased one runner very far and ended up in the control room of the ship. This was the moment I realized that this whole place was a ship. The ship began to bank and before I knew dark water was rushing inside. The ship sank very quickly, almost like the Titanic with one side pointing to the sky and one side sinking into the water. I fell down into the water with all the other people and it didn't take long for everyone to realize that we were not going to make it. I swam trying to keep my head up to breathe and find my family and friends so I could say goodbye. After a while I found my dad and my boyfriend, hugged them and tried to message them that I loved them because we all were completely under water at this point. I remember thinking ""I will see you in the afterlife."" My mother had already died because I saw a dress floating around that I knew belonged to her. I took the dress and squeezed it and the next thing I knew was that I felt really sleepy and I couldn't hold my breath any longer. I felt like I was falling, although there really wasn't anywhere to fall to.

Then I felt a thud and opened my eyes. I was on a beautiful field filled with flowers and heard laughter and speech. I got up and I was wearing my mother's dress. After looking around I realized that there was a huge lake and the field was next to it. On the other side of the lake there was this huge bright glow like the sun, but million times brighter. Then I saw cats. The cats were playing together in the field and some slept under trees. I really don't know how but I instantly knew these cats were people I had met during my time on the ship. Then I felt a tap on my shoulder and realized that one of my friends was here too, as a human. We said hello and walked together on the shore, where the waves from the wave hit our toes. There were a few cats drinking from the lake and I asked them what this place was. They just looked at me and then pointed to the lake. A huge creature rose from the water, I mean a HUGE creature. Somehow I still didn't feel scared. The creature didn't say a word but nodded and smiled (even though it did not have a face) when I asked is this the afterlife. Then I looked behind me and watched as the field, the trees and the whole place began to fill with more cats and humans. Then I woke up.

If you read this far, congratulations. I wonder if you dream about afterlife this vividly and if you do, do you see the same exact dream every time you dream about it?

I’m not sure why this happens to me but it’s comforting for some reason. Is there any type of reason for this? When I wake up I have such a light feeling in my chest and sometimes the weirdest thoughts pop into my head and I just try ignoring them, but they always come true maybe not in the same exact day but it’s things that you wouldn’t think would actually happen.",0,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/Dreams/comments/13t1jum/dreams_predicting_my_future/,False,False
206,Dreams,2023-05-27 07:45:58,Gloomy_Scarcity4617,Are my Dreams telling me to end myself?,"I'm having some dream issues.

My first dream today was of me on the front row of a taxi, but suddenly the driver hopped on my lap and I had to control the wheel with one hand. Then it stopped, and he took the wheel. Again on the same road, he jumped on my seat, and I had to drive. It ended when my cat woke up and I had to feed him. It was 4 a.m., as my cat is on medication. She used to wake up at 2 a.m.

I went to sleep again, and this time I was with my sister on my kindergarten ground, which was located at Hills. I looked up, and there was a man in the middle of the sky with a fishing rod-like thing in the frame where his suic\*de rope was attached to the near end. I was literally able to zoom in and see his neck twist. Then I realized it was my uncle. The hanging man wore the same blue and white stripes clothes and backward cap, which is my uncle's thing. I screamed and ran toward him, but then I realized we couldn't reach him. It ended.",2,4,4,0.84,0,,/r/Dreams/comments/13t19i1/are_my_dreams_telling_me_to_end_myself/,True,False

update with extra info that I forgot: currently my mother is having some problems that's making her sad and depressed and I feel really bad for her, maybe that dream made her problems appear as snakes and that's why these snakes appeared at her bedroom?

210,Dreams,2023-05-27 06:56:50,itsokiguess20,Is this sleep paralysis?,"I know people with sleep paralysis and they tell me that what I'm about to say is sleep paralysis but yet when they explain how it feels its not the same. Just recently I've started having these ""dreams"" like right as I'm falling asleep but not quite there yet. It feels as if my body starts tensing so bad I'm stiff and I mean my entire body, tensing so aggressively that it feels like it's about to explode. Its so intense that its like i can even hear my ears making a flushing sound from the pressure like theyre about to explode. One thing that does match with the sleep paralysis is that once my body starts feeling tingly (that's how I know it's about to tense up) the more i cant move. But im not like limp or can't feel anything,  it's like I can feel my body 100× more. And I'm still aware in these ""so called dreams"" and ill try and scream for my boyfriend to help me or to wake me up and ill be trying to move and I can slightly but when I mention this to him he says I wasn't making noise or moving but I swear it's real  idk. I've had vivid dreams, dreams that last days where I go to sleep inside of them and wake up continuing the dream, at one point I couldn't tell the difference between my dreams and reality and I'm too scared to fall asleep because I might end up trapped and maybe thats whats happening here from a different perspective.  But this new reoccurring dream started after I moved in with my boyfriend about a year ago and I just don't know how to put into words how this feels or what I mean. You know how when your foots asleep or arm etc it's tingling really bad? But when you try and walk or move your arm the tingling gets more intense and feels like little needles? That's what my body feels like while it's happening or atleast the closest thing I can think of. And it kinda goes in and out like it starts getting intense and I'll try yelling for him before I'm full on stiff for about 3-8 seconds then itll feel like its slowly going away before it comes back. I also can't even breathe for that little bit while its at its peak, and itll happen sometimes once, soemtimes up to 4 times or so, it just doesn't feel right but idk how to explain it any better. Can  anyone explain or have similar ""dreams""????",3,2,2,1.0,0,,/r/Dreams/comments/13t0h6a/is_this_sleep_paralysis/,False,False
