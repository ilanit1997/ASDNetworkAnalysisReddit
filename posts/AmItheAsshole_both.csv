667,668,yes,AmItheAsshole,2023-04-08 13:43:59,SpicyRamen5193,AITA for eating the last of the instant ramen we both like?,"I and my BF live together and about 2 months ago we went to the asian market and bought a lot of stuff including 5 individual packs of ramen we both like. Most of what we bought was food I liked and I payed for a good chunck of it. (He gives me grocery money along with the rent to make it easier to pay for things).

Last week I was hungry and seen that he hadn't eaten the last of the ramen that I'd left for him and we hadn't gone to the store yet  so I decided that I'd make and eat that for my dinner, thinking I would just buy more whenever he decided he wanted that kind of ramen again, considering I found a store much closer to us thay sells that same ramen. Today after work, we came home and asks where the ramen we got from the store a while back was at and I told him I ate the last of it because it'd been nearly 2 months and he hadn't touched it and I didn't think he was going to eat it. He got upset and has decided not to eat anything. I tried offering other things we had in the kitchen or going to the store to buy the ramen or something else and he refused both options.

This week has been kind of crappy for him and he can't eat dairy at the moment because he's taking a smoking break and lactose makes him sick. We have other non dairy foods in the house.

2417,2418,yes,AmItheAsshole,2023-05-13 02:11:24,aairo1228,AITA for parking in a handicap spot?,"I can explain.

So I was driving to the grocery store with my mom in her car. She had surgery recently and was wheelchair bound so she got a temporary handicap tag.

I pulled around looking for a close parking spot, but at first I couldn't find one so I put my blinkers on and helped her into her wheelchair before I went around looking for a parking spot again. She went in and waited at the front for me so I could get the cart and help her with her shopping.

I went around to look for a spot that was relatively close when I spotted a handicap spot that had just opened up. I went ahead and pulled in, and after I locked up and started walking to go inside, a car pulled up next to me and began SCREAMING at the top of her lungs that she needed the spot because she was handicapped, and that I was fraudulently using the spot.

I'm autistic with cPTSD, and shut down the *second* someone starts to shout. So, I go back to the car, and pull out while she's yelling her head off, then park in the waaaaaaay back hoping that she would park and be in before I had a chance to meet with her again. And I figured that I'd just pull the car around when we were done and do the blinker thing again. Not a big deal, right? Wrong!

But unfortunately, by the time I got up to the store door, she was there, screaming her head off at me again. I was mortified. I walked in, still not saying anything and feeling faint bc I'm about to have a panic attack. It took me a second to find my mom with this bitch behind me, screaming 'you don't get to part in a disabled spot?! Who do you think you are?! Son of a b*h! Do you know the distress you caused me?!' I genuinely thought she was gonna try to beat me with her cane.

Of course I don't turn around to tell her I'm about to have a full on melt down bc she doesn't know the distress she's causing me because now I can't even remember that language is part of my capabilities. But regardless.

I find my mom looking at greeting cards and walk up to her as this person is still screaming at me, and take her hand to tell her I'm starting to panic. My mom is a Karen all of her own, and we do NOT have a good relationship bc of how entitled  and narcissistic she is, but this was the one time she actually defended me. And it was a short fight, where my mom rolled up to this woman and started screaming at her until she walked away.

So yeah, TD;DR parked in parking spot bc mom was handicap after I dropped her off. Got chased by handicap Karen until handicap mom chased her off.",21,11,11,0.88,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13g4b4f')>,,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13g4b4f/aita_for_parking_in_a_handicap_spot/,,,False,True

Now i feel devastated everytime he asks me ""what have i ever done for him"". I used to take care of him too but it was appreciated before but it's just something that he won't even look twice upon. I buy him gifts but he doesn't appreciate. Today i read one of his letters and asked him that you used to be so innocent. And used to write about everything we did and how you loved everything about me. To that he said ""everybody loves chase"" these three words have broken me to my core. I'm not able to talk to him since then. How is it fair? That the love he's getting from me is boring now. It's been six months now and I've been crying to him about it once every month that he has changed. He just shuts me off by saying that we've just matured.

75,76,,AmItheAsshole,2023-05-27 08:00:36,ThrowRAsisteruni,AITA for asking my bf to stop being so generous with his younger sister?,"I've seen a few similar posts on this sub with very mixed reactions, so I'm hoping you guys can help me out here. Me (27m) and my bf (28m) have been together for 6 years. He has a younger sister (19f) who's in her first year of university. My bf has been paying for her living expenses, while we've been renting in a different city. We're not rich by any stretch of the imagination, but this is defo within the bounds of our finances. However I've been arguing for about a year now that we should be cutting down on our expenses to save towards buying a house together. Atm we're renting in a city that's outrageously expensive. IMO we should buy a home just outside the city. I've done some research and mortgage in the town we're thinking of would be waaay cheaper than renting in the city, and the only real difference is we'd have to take a pretty quick train to get to work/into the city.

In theory at least, my bf agrees with this. The problem is that the belt-tightening would also involve sending a lot less money to his sister. To be clear, I'm not talking about cutting her off or anything. She still has her student loan and we'd still be sending her enough money that she can still eat and drink, and go out partying with her friends once or twice a month, as long as she doesn't go too wild. Plus if she gets a job I don't think she'd really feel the difference too badly. But my bf doesn't like this idea. To cut out a lot of irrelevant family drama, he basically got all of his university living totally subsidised by his parents before him and his sister were disowned. He thinks it's unfair for his sister to not be able to have the same uni experience that he had just because his parents are awful. He wants to make sure she doesn't have to work beyond a little Saturday job so she can experience what he experienced.

From my point of view if we cut back on our spending for a couple years or so, then not only would we have a house to our name but we'd also hopefully have more disposable income. We'd probably be able to send more money to her in the long run. A little short term sacrifice for the sake of future gain. Just to be clear, I do care about his sister and want to see her happy. I just think that this is better for everyone in the long run. Like, sure maybe her first couple years might be a little less fun but it's not as if she'll be hard done by. She'll still have all the same support as your average student, and in a couple years in we'll be able to go back to being more generous with our money. Plus the majority of the belt-tightening will be on me and my bf's end. Its not like I'm trying to make his little sister pay for our mortgage lol.

I dunno if I'm just being blockheaded here, but I really can't see what's wrong with my logic. And before anyone asks, yes I'm the autistic one in the relationship lol.

We exchanged greetings and had a brief conversation about school. At one point, she asked me if I could lend her $2, stating that friends should help each other. Despite feeling skeptical, I agreed and handed her $2, hoping she would forget about it.

After the meeting, Alice waited for me at the school gate, reminding me about the money. I only had a $5 bill, which I hadn't intended to give her. Alice insisted that I give her the $5 if I didn't have $2. Fortunately, I managed to find some change and gave her $2.

Following that incident, I tried to avoid Alice as much as possible. Although we occasionally crossed paths and exchanged greetings, I kept my interactions brief.

Two weeks later, during a celebration at the hall, Alice sat beside me and continued to engage me in conversation despite my attempts to disengage. While I was recording my friends' performance, Alice noticed a $50 bill in my bag. She proceeded to tell me about her financial struggles and how she wouldnt have anything to eat, and asking if I could lend her money again. I declined, explaining that the money was my allowance and that I had plans to eat out with my friends. She suggested I buy something during recess and give her $10, even proposing that I deliver food to her house. I was taken aback and didn't respond.

At the end of the celebration, Alice confronted me, expressing her frustration and hunger. She accused me of not caring after hearing her story and choosing to eat out with my friends. I retorted, reminding her that I never agreed to lend her money in the first place and that she hadn't repaid the previous loan. I asserted that I wasn't a charity service and walked away with my friends, while Alice continued to yell at me.

A couple of months ago one of my children (9) really got in to baking. They're doing an awesome job baking cakes, cupcakes, pies, bread, cookies,... and spending a lot of time/taking great pride in decorating them. 

Now, our family has caught wind of her passion and we have all been stimulating her dream to become a worldclass pattisier. She has been recieving ""orders"" and even when she doesn't she'll try and bake something for whoever we're seeing that day. 

Fast forward to today. We have an elderly couple in the family and she decided she was going to try cookies. As the husband of the couple is a diabetic she decided to try her hand at a sugarfree recipe so he could eat some as well. 

She spends a lot of time researching recipes, baking and decorating said cookies and when the elderly couple arrives she proudly shows off her plate and says ""look, these are sugarfree so you can have some too!""

The man looks at her like she asked him to eat fried dogshit and tells her, quite angrily but without raising his voice that she doesn't get to police what he eats and that if she wants to be a baker she'll need to ""actually get good"". 

I watched all enjoyment and pride drain from her face and her eyes teared up. Already fuming i'm walking up to my child when the man rolls his eyes, calls her ""a little baby"" and tells her that she'll also have to learn how to take critisism. 

*Now, from a parenting pov I know I fucked up, this is no example to set.* 

I absolutely lost my shit. I yelled (full on yelled) that he was to leave my house and that he wouldn't be getting the cookies even if he promised to choke on them. When he refused to leave I grabbed his arm and removed him from my house, while using some colorful language and promising he wouldn't be allowed near any part of my family ever again. They ended up leaving, leaving my child gutted and wondering what she did wrong. 

I've spent the last hour consoling her and making sure she realises she did absolutely nothing wrong and that she doesn't lose her passion for baking over this. Now messages and phonecalls are coming in, telling me I overreacted, to the extent that I am starting to wonder if I actually did.

I live in a row of houses, and two of these houses have pet cats. The cats are outdoor cats and I see them around the street. Occasionally one comes into our garden. I’m not home a lot so I don’t know how often or what it does in my garden.

I know I’m catastrophising (pun not intended but welcome), but would I be TA if my neighbour’s cats died from my lilies? I don’t own any cats so it literally didn’t cross my mind when I planted them.

A small but related note is that I love feeding the wild birds and often have many in my garden. Could it make it look more asshole-y if it looks like I planted them on purpose to hurt the cats, given their (cats in general, not these specific ones) reputation for killing birds?

84,85,,AmItheAsshole,2023-05-27 07:33:15,Several_Drawer340,AITA for not waiting for my husband before recovering my stolen car?,"tl;dr I drove my stolen car home without waiting for my husband or the cops. Now my husband is pissed at me for not considering him and being reckless.

(Note: This post is NOT “Am I the Idiot” for not waiting for the COPS before recovering my car. That has already been established in vivo.)

6 days ago, my car was stolen. Today, my friend and I found my car in the parking lot of our local mall. It was a  total fluke. 

I am irrationally attached to this car. I’ve owned and maintained for 11 years, including paying for a pricy head gasket job recently. I want to pass it to my daughter when she learns to drive. 

When we saw my car today, I started freaking out. I called the police and was put on hold. We waved down a mall security guard, he said to wait for the cops. I got through with the police and they said they were sending someone.

The mall guard told us the cops usually take an hour or more to show up for stolen cars, which checks out since our police force is notoriously understaffed and overburdened. Then mall guy told us that he needed to keep patrolling, and he left.

So there my friend and I were, alone with my car, wondering if the thief would come back before the cops showed up. They had made some bumpersticker adjustments and left a few backpacks inside, so our guess was that it wasn’t just abandoned. The ignition looked normal. I had the key. 

While fairly nauseous with excitement and fear, I called my husband to tell him we found it. He said he would be there soon. Then my friend suggested we try the key, and if it worked, we take the car before the thief came back. I gave them the key and sure enough, the car started. I jumped in and drove it home, shaking.

I know it was stupid and dangerous e.g. evidence destruction and drug residues. I was in full blown fight or flight reptile brain mode over an old car because I’m a deeply sentimental hack. Anyway…

My husband calls while I’m en route home and I tell him what’s up. I get home, call the cops, eat the crow and told them I took my car and to come to my house to do the “recovery.”

Remarkably, the cops showed up within half an hour. They took fingerprints, went through the contents of the car (lots of drugs “recovered” from the backpacks), and told me they won’t be able to prosecute the person if they can’t prove they drove my car, which will be tough since I destroyed prints by driving it. Then they leave. 

Meanwhile, my husband is brooding. We get to talking - he’s upset that I didn’t wait for him before leaving the mall and felt I didn’t consider him, and that my reckless behavior scares him on many levels. 

I explained that I wasn’t thinking rationally in my adrenalined out state, that everything happened really fast. I acknowledged it was fucking stupid of me and I made a split decision on the urging of my friend. At least now we don’t have to fret about how we’re going to afford a new car anymore… yay? He’s not having it and is sleeping in another room tonight.

I’ve known my husband since 04. We got married in 06. We don’t have children. I never wanted them, and he always said he respected that. We travelled a lot and had a lot of fun. My husband has been my best friend and support through the years. My mother died in 2015 and that was unimaginable, but he was a rock.

Skipping ahead to last year, he out of nowhere sat me down and suggested we try an open relationship. I was thrown off. I thought our sex life was pretty good. His libido is higher than mine, and he initiates more than half the time but there’s nothing I wouldn’t do to please him sexually. 

I was hesitant but eventually agreed to it. We established rules and I started reading up on polyamory. The rules were that he couldn’t have anyone in our bed and he always used protection. I didn’t have rules cause I didn’t plan on seeing anyone else.

You could probably guess by the title that I changed my mind. I joined the apps. I told my husband and he was confused and genuinely curious about what I could want to gain from this. I said I wanted to explore. The books I’d been reading opened my mind to a whole new world. Reluctantly, he gave me permission to see other men with the same rules I gave him: no hosting, protection.

I started noticing how inquisitive he was about what I was doing and who I was seeing. He asked me if I was seeing men repeatedly or just having ons’s. I told him that, while I wasn’t completely comfortable going into detail, I could say that I was seeing someone pretty regularly. He pushed it again and was curious about what we do together. I told him that I’ve been exploring kink with this guy, and it makes me feel empowered.

That was that. Until a few days later when he told me that he thinks we should become exclusive again. Reddit, I’m PISSED. I flat out told him no, that this feels unfair. He said the fact that I’m letting men “tie me up and violate me” bothers him immensely. I assured him everything was safe. He didn’t care.

The last conversation we had, which was this morning, was him giving me an ultimatum that if I go on anymore dates before we sort this out, I can find a divorce lawyer. I have a weekend trip planned (that’s been booked for weeks and paid up) with my guy next weekend.

86,87,,AmItheAsshole,2023-05-27 07:19:33,YoYowhatsupman123,AITA for wanting a team-mate off our competitive sport team,"Long story short we started playing a team sport (volleyball) initially socially but with intent to play competitively. One of the team members who  I will call John joined our team through another team-mate. 

We play competitive once a week but train three times a week. Training is much more of a social and informal thing as well. 

John only comes on the competitive nights and does not attend the training sessions, whilst the other team members attend the competitive nights and the training sessions.

The team has expressed that they are frustrated with John as he comes every week to the competitions but does not attend training. He is also very new to the sport, not playing much at all previously, and making bad plays and making us lose games and lose points consistently. We do have to pay a fee every week so we feel that we are wasting our money. 

I privately messaged John suggesting he attends the social/training nights only if he does enjoy the sport, as this is more informal and casual instead of the competitive nights. I included in the message that as a team we were a bit frustrated with his performance. John didn’t reply to the message and suddenly stopped showing up to the sport all together, but has been messaging other team-members that he feels like a let down and thus does not want to come anymore. 

I do feel bad in this situation, and it may be because of my competitive nature, but I think it only makes sense to attend the training/social nights if you are only going to play the sport casually. 

What do you guys think?

ADD-IT:

John has also been going around telling people that he ‘overheard me’ telling other people behind his back that he is a let down when I clearly private messaged him about the situation but he just did not respond, which is now making me look like a bad person.",8,6,6,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13t0unx')>,,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13t0unx/aita_for_wanting_a_teammate_off_our_competitive/,,,False,False
