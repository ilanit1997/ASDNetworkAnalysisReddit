452,AmItheAsshole,2023-04-08 13:43:59,SpicyRamen5193,AITA for eating the last of the instant ramen we both like?,"I and my BF live together and about 2 months ago we went to the asian market and bought a lot of stuff including 5 individual packs of ramen we both like. Most of what we bought was food I liked and I payed for a good chunck of it. (He gives me grocery money along with the rent to make it easier to pay for things).

Last week I was hungry and seen that he hadn't eaten the last of the ramen that I'd left for him and we hadn't gone to the store yet  so I decided that I'd make and eat that for my dinner, thinking I would just buy more whenever he decided he wanted that kind of ramen again, considering I found a store much closer to us thay sells that same ramen. Today after work, we came home and asks where the ramen we got from the store a while back was at and I told him I ate the last of it because it'd been nearly 2 months and he hadn't touched it and I didn't think he was going to eat it. He got upset and has decided not to eat anything. I tried offering other things we had in the kitchen or going to the store to buy the ramen or something else and he refused both options.

This week has been kind of crappy for him and he can't eat dairy at the moment because he's taking a smoking break and lactose makes him sick. We have other non dairy foods in the house.

1456,AmItheAsshole,2023-05-13 02:11:24,aairo1228,AITA for parking in a handicap spot?,"I can explain.

So I was driving to the grocery store with my mom in her car. She had surgery recently and was wheelchair bound so she got a temporary handicap tag.

I pulled around looking for a close parking spot, but at first I couldn't find one so I put my blinkers on and helped her into her wheelchair before I went around looking for a parking spot again. She went in and waited at the front for me so I could get the cart and help her with her shopping.

I went around to look for a spot that was relatively close when I spotted a handicap spot that had just opened up. I went ahead and pulled in, and after I locked up and started walking to go inside, a car pulled up next to me and began SCREAMING at the top of her lungs that she needed the spot because she was handicapped, and that I was fraudulently using the spot.

I'm autistic with cPTSD, and shut down the *second* someone starts to shout. So, I go back to the car, and pull out while she's yelling her head off, then park in the waaaaaaay back hoping that she would park and be in before I had a chance to meet with her again. And I figured that I'd just pull the car around when we were done and do the blinker thing again. Not a big deal, right? Wrong!

But unfortunately, by the time I got up to the store door, she was there, screaming her head off at me again. I was mortified. I walked in, still not saying anything and feeling faint bc I'm about to have a panic attack. It took me a second to find my mom with this bitch behind me, screaming 'you don't get to part in a disabled spot?! Who do you think you are?! Son of a b*h! Do you know the distress you caused me?!' I genuinely thought she was gonna try to beat me with her cane.

Of course I don't turn around to tell her I'm about to have a full on melt down bc she doesn't know the distress she's causing me because now I can't even remember that language is part of my capabilities. But regardless.

I find my mom looking at greeting cards and walk up to her as this person is still screaming at me, and take her hand to tell her I'm starting to panic. My mom is a Karen all of her own, and we do NOT have a good relationship bc of how entitled  and narcissistic she is, but this was the one time she actually defended me. And it was a short fight, where my mom rolled up to this woman and started screaming at her until she walked away.

So yeah, TD;DR parked in parking spot bc mom was handicap after I dropped her off. Got chased by handicap Karen until handicap mom chased her off.",21,10,10,0.87,0,,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13g4b4f/aita_for_parking_in_a_handicap_spot/,False,True
2036,AmItheAsshole,2021-09-09 08:44:34,Vessecora,"AITA for playing ball with my dog in the backyard, causing the neighbour dog to bark?","My partner (25M) and I (26F) own a cross-eyed, anxious labrador called Atlas. Our next door neighbour owns a border collie, and unfortunately he's constantly at the bordering fence in their small backyard.

Now this is where the issue arises. The border collie barks at Atlas continually for as long as he's outside. He barks at Atlas whenever Atlas is eating, playing, or going to the toilet. Yet the border collie is quiet at most other times. 

Here's the part where I think I might be the asshole. Now I don't think I'm technically doing anything wrong by spending half an hour or more every day playing ball with my dog, but apparently since we moved in there have been multiple noise complaints about the barking.

My partner has ASD and anxiety so he's always worrying about the noise since our dog's presence is the trigger. He thinks I'm being an asshole to our other neighbours for not keeping Atlas' backyard presence to a minimum, considering the situation.

I was speaking to one of our other neighbours about the noise complaints. Both of us agreed that it was warranted. But when I mentioned the above situation, they agreed with my partner and said that we should just take him to the dog park every day instead of once a week so I'm not being asshole by making it worse (paraphrasing, of course). 

I don't know... I just feel like I should be able to enjoy the use of the backyard without having to hear or worry about the near constant barking. I personally have not submitted a noise complaint. We are renting though, so any complaint from others that accidentally adds our address gets back to the real estate, which is part of why my partner is so concerned that he'll only take Atlas out for the essentials as this has actually happened.

Aside from the AH nature of our neighbour possibly keeping the border collie in their small backyard all the time, AITA?

3211,AmItheAsshole,2020-12-28 11:16:52,Kleecarim,"AITA for being mad at my parents because they ""stole their money back""?","First, context. My sister is 14 and gives me money to pay a netflix account for her with my card (she gives me cash, I pay online) because our parents are pretty much control freaks who monitor exactly what and for how long we (especially she) watched on our shared account. When we both still used the shared family netflix account my parents would take it away for almost anything, even watching too much a day in the holidays lol, which pretty much pissed me and my sister off. 

So, she decided she wanted to pay her own account. I didn't contribute to it with my money because my parents now don't control me as much as they used to, but they still do that with my sister, so I started using my card to pay it.

Now, fast forward a few months, to today. My parents have access to my bank account because that's their condition for me getting pocket money. Well, they found out that I am paying for my own account, and after telling me to cancel it because ""they didn't want to pay for it twice"" and me ignoring it they went to my bank account and took almost 70 bucks (the money I spent on Netflix during the last 5 months). I sure as hell was super mad at them but they just laughed it off and told me that since its their money (my pocket money) they can basically do whatever the fuck they want

I had a job during the summer so that's bullshit, and I would say less than half of my money comes from them but they won't listen to me. I didn't tell them my sister was paying for it and using it because they would have just punished us both instead of just me.
I told my parents that I would remove their access to my account but they told me if I did that I wouldn't recieve any more money from them, and I need their money since I don't have time to work during school months

167,AmItheAsshole,2023-05-27 10:59:23,CasualEncounter4321,WIBTA- Friendship Plateau,"I (female 23) have a friend of 6 years (female 28) let’s call her Marley. 
She’s my X’s sister. We’ve always been close. I’m actively involved in her family. (Two children & Fiancé. )
I recently had a baby-5 months ago 
While I was pregnant I would go see her often Visit 1-2 days & stay a few nights at a time, up until I was 2 weeks away from my due date. I needed to stay home and settle in our new apartment to prepare for my L.O. 
I worked a full time job & drive 40 minutes to see her each day that I go. 20there20back. 
Our partners stay offshore hers for 2 weeks,  mine for a month..She wants company every single day that he’s gone. I felt like with Work, My Personal life, & My first child I kind of needed a break from over extending myself. If I don’t answer/ if I’m not available Marley calls the next friend or family member & they visit her for hours or a night/nights at a time.  

Did I mention Marley doesn’t drive or work? You didn’t ask but, yes, she has a car sitting in the garage. She drives occasionally
She is well & physically capable
She’s a stay at home mom with her 1yr old & 8yr old
I take Marley and Marleys children to doctors appointments/Check Ups, Occasionally the Store & Frivolous Shopping 

Just an example of what she will have me go over for: 

One time she called me to go over because her baby was Crying/Screaming. I was pregnant and literally just got into my house from finishing up a shift at work from 5:30 AM-2:00 PM (No Break and No sitting the entire shift.) As soon as I got there she told me the baby had gas, Marley gave her medicine & needed me to stay a few hours ‘in case she needed to go to the hospital’ She knew how to handle it in the first place. I was pregnant & honestly I can hardly regulate my own anxiety
OR 
The first week after I had my baby & my boyfriend had JUST got home. Picked him up from the airport with his mom, didn’t leave the parking lot yet. She ‘needed’ me to go sit with her just in case her 1 yr old daughter needed to go to the hospital for a cough. 
I’ve told her she could call me if it was a definite need for the hospital. She said she wouldn’t be able to wait for me if it were an emergency. I’d need to be there before hand. Just. In. Case. 
I drive out of my way & have to completely plan around going to see her every single time. 
It’s stressing me out. 
I just want to be home in my own bed. I have so many things to carry back and forth from her house to mine all while having a baby & being the only one of TWO of us to do things like this. It REALLY wears me out. 

So you can see why it gets a little exhausting. I just finished taking Stateboard exams, while kind of feeling like she didn’t understand what it meant for my career. She asked me to go out to the bar an hour away TWO days before my exam. Wanted me to perform services on her like Dermaplane, Tan, Lash Extensions etc. 

I tell myself- she can’t relate. 
To the Self Discipline, Mental Preparation, the money I’m spending on Supplies/Gas for my car.  Not to mention I have a 5 month old I have to be hands on with almost 25/8 

I’m wanting to go back to work & school again. 
 I almost feel like I’m not doing enough when I don’t go see her.. I’ve tried to cut it short by going once or twice every other week. I don’t want to be a bad friend 

I’m mentally preparing to talk to her about this
I don’t want to start to feel resentment. It would be so unfortunate for her not to understand where I’m coming from.",2,2,2,1.0,0,,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13t4e18/wibta_friendship_plateau/,False,False

I went all out on the ingredients and even made a practice one at home *just* to be sure. I thought it tasted fantastic so was ready to go at it.

I must’ve spent an **hour** simmering it, adding spices, cutting garlic into the thinnest slices ever, etc.

My friend then fills the used tomato can with water and just pours it in “to get the last of it out”.

In my opinion it was ruined. They agreed and said it was tasteless. Except that it wasn’t because of the water. It must have always been tasteless.

Friend and roommate then start making a new bolognese because obviously I was wrong. They use the ingredients *I bought* whole the roommate laughs a little while saying “sorry for just taking over :D”.

I’m not super talkative and leave after dinner saying that I’m tired and have work the next day anyway. Didn’t help that they kept saying it was good they made a new one and how impressed they were over they made such a good sauce in only 20 min.

Friend texts me a couple of days later and says I owe them an apology for making dinner awkward.

Yeah, this is of course just my side of the story, and even though I feel that I wasn’t talkative, I don’t doubt that my aura must’ve given off an awkward vibe.

169,AmItheAsshole,2023-05-27 10:50:33,Scary_Helicopter_611,AITA for asking my roommate to give me my half of our deposit ?," Hello Reddit! I have recently made the decision to leave the expensive city I am living in and move back home. This was a somewhat hasty decision that I made at the end of April, with the intention to leave this summer. I told my roommate right away to give them as much notice as possible, due to the fact they were going to be away for a month visiting family which coincided with my move. I ended up pushing my move date back by a month to help give them more time to sort out what they wanted to do e.g get a new roommate or move out, but the fact of the matter is they get back around two weeks before I leave. While I’m aware this is inconvenient, I gave them more than 3 months notice that this was going to be happening. 

Here’s where I’m wondering if I’m the AH. I recently spoke to the building manager who told me that the only way to get my very large deposit back was for my roommate to give me my half of the money themselves, and than they would take all of it from the building when they move out. As of now my roommate has no intention of leaving here or getting a new roommate. I am moving overseas, and shipping boxes is working out to be much more expensive than I thought. I need the deposit money to help pay for that. I just recently lost my job so have no source of income.

 When I told them this, they said that it was unfair of me to ask them to pay that money right now, especially “under the circumstances I was leaving them in”. I’ll also mention that I asked for 200 less than my half in case there was a cleaning fee or damages they wanted to take out when my roommate moved. There is no significant damage to the apartment so in my mind 200 was more than enough for my half. Roomate argued that if they gave me the money now and were charged more than that 200 later, they’d be the ones getting screwed. To which I replied that if that was the case of course I’d send more money. 

Roommate wants to wait and give me my half of the deposit when they move out. Although we moved into this apartment as friends a few years ago, things have been distant and we haven’t been close in a while. While I’d like to think they wouldn’t screw me over and not send me my half of the deposit upon moving out, you never really know what will happen. I’ll be out of the country, and could literally do nothing if they decided to do that. On the other hand, if they say they don’t have the money right now… what can I really do? But like I said earlier, I need the money to help pay for my move. 

Roommate is arguing that I knew that they would be away for a month and not working as well as having to essentially pay double rent when I leave (as they don’t want to get a new roommate), so it’s unfair of me to expect them to have the money for my half of the deposit.

For the last few years, he has had quite an extreme drinking problem. Sometimes when he drinks, he behaves really badly - in ways that directly impact the people around him. He has reaped the consequences of his drinking ten fold - sometimes in big ways(near death accidents), sometimes in small ways. I have always stuck by him though, and I have provided a huge amount of empathy and compassion when no one else has. 

In December, he came to meet me abroad. Immediately, the excess drinking started. He behaved incredibly badly ( hyper aggression so intense that he got kicked out of our hostel, took my passport, passed out on the sidewalk covered in vomit and more). 

This night wrecked our relationship. Things were never the same after that. After two tension filled weeks together abroad, he blatantly ignored me for two months. He practically ghosted me. 

I spoke about the incidents and how I was feeling to one of our shared friends. We were talking out of hurt and concern. As a bystander listening in to that conversation, no one would be able to deny that we frikin love this guy. This conversation got back to my cousin from another shared friend who overhead. He was furious with me - told me that I’ve broken his trust. We worked through this “betrayal” and for the first time in months our relationship started to get back in track. 

I had also vented to another one of my cousins about that night. Again, it is not a justification, but I did not tell them to hurt him. I told her because I myself was hurting, frustrated and worried.  I did not say anything about him, I just told her what had happened and that he worries me. Last night, this too got back to him. 

He messaged me this morning saying that he never wants to speak to me again because I have spoken about him badly to people. A part of me understands, but the other part of me knows that I never spoke out of nastiness - but out of my own frustration and hurt (doesn’t make it right, I know - but I kind of see why my venting was warranted).

Amanda replies that she can't and says sorry. I ask why, and she says she's gonna tell me a secret. And I ask her what.

I lost my only extended family member suddenly last year. It was a traumatic one. My friends were so amazingly supportive, brought food and sent flowers, came to the services, came to spend time with me and my family. Except my husbands sister that I thought was one of my best friends. Her absence during the whole thing was even more obvious when everyone else was so supportive. I know not everyone has the capacity to pour into another person at all times and have always acknowledged she has a lot on her own plate with 4 kids, but she never even gave a “sorry for your loss” text after I kept desperately trying to reach out and being at such a low point in my life. 

Eventually I confronted her about it because my feelings were hurt and the distance between us kept growing and I wanted to make an attempt to fix it. She told me she couldn’t talk to me about my [addict] family member dying because addicts are a trigger for her and she has no sympathy for them, and also then calling my husband an alcoholic and me an enabler, but also that since she already felt distant from me prior to the loss that she didn’t feel the need to reach out and be a good supportive friend.

177,AmItheAsshole,2023-05-27 09:42:50,Valuable-Custard6374,AITA for the way I react during fights with my SO before my breaking point?,"Recently I've been struggling with my relationship with my SO because we are getting into arguments and fights. I've been struggling to understand who in the situation is the one perpetuating the fighting, myself or my SO. I will give just the fight that happened today as an example of what happens when things get out of hand.  
  
For some context: Earlier today I was posting on a forum. I joined a debate and was having fun with the topic with a few other people. My SO doesn't understand why I bother posting on the forums, and ridiculed me about it, which he's done multiple times in the past.  
  
Later, we were looking at houses and I made a comment about one that had an easement on the property, commenting that the property taxes may be lower because of it by a slight amount. He argued it wasn't true, so we looked at a few houses in the surrounding area, and I was correct about the property taxes being lower, but he insisted that I was wrong, despite us comparing the numbers. Then, he tells me that he was the one who said what I said, and that I was wrong because I said what he said. This frustrated me and I said ""What are you talking about. The numbers added up to make my point exactly."" he continues to argue this point, and I tell him that I no longer want to have the conversation and that I'm done and to please stop talking about it.  
  
He continues to push it, and I continue to tell him I am not having fun and I don't want to have the conversation with him any longer. He then brings up ""How is this any different than your ""debates"" on that forum? you just like arguing with people"". This really got me pissed off so I told him a few more times to please stop the conversation and that it was making me upset and that debating and fighting are two different things entirely. He told me ""You're the one talking about it, it's not me"". I asked him to please stop and to leave me alone a few times again before I couldn't take it anymore, so I told him ""You're a fucking asshole"" and I got up from my chair. I said ""I can not believe you are forcing me to physically leave my house in order to get away from this conversation."" and I left the house with him continuing to yell whatever his side of the conversation was at me as I left.  
  
This happens so often, and I'm sick and tired of it. I feel like I'm the one causing these fights to start, but I don't know if it's because I actually am causing it, or if he's making me feel like I'm causing it by the way that he's interacting with me. I know that by the end of the fights I've reacted poorly and am definitely a jerk, but I can't pin point whether I am the catalyst of these fights or not. I just feel like I'm going insane.  
  
AITA for reacting the way that I do in these fights before the point of me breaking and saying something inherently mean?",24,5,5,0.78,0,,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13t34sj/aita_for_the_way_i_react_during_fights_with_my_so/,False,False
178,AmItheAsshole,2023-05-27 09:41:15,prani2040,AITA for asking my girlfriend to dress better on a date night?,"So we had decided to go out on the weekend and I suggest going somewhere fancy. She says okay and I find an upscale Chinese restaurant and show it to her, she says cool and we agree to spend the evening there. 

Fast forward to the evening, I see her dressed in a t-shirt and worn down jeans. I ask her why she’s not wearing a dress and she just replies, she doesn’t feel like it. I’m like “uhh okay, but I told you it’s a fancy place” and she’s like “Ah it’s just a Chinese restaurant”

I pull up their Instagram and try to show her their feed to convince her that it’s upscale, but she doesn’t even want to look at it.

I ask her again to dress appropriately and this time she’s pissed and she says we’re not going anywhere tonight. We haven’t talked since then, it’s been a day now.

She usually likes to dress up even when we go to a normal bar. This is leaving me confused. AITA here?",40,14,14,0.82,0,,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13t33tc/aita_for_asking_my_girlfriend_to_dress_better_on/,False,False
179,AmItheAsshole,2023-05-27 09:40:51,em1_em1,AITA for getting my MIL kicked out after she spilled coffee in my suitcase?,"I (24f) came home at 3am from work trip few days ago. I was jetlagged, only wanted to see my wife (25f) and go to sleep. I was surprised to see that my MIL (48f) was also waiting with my wife for my arrival at our living room. The second I walk in, my MIL starts complaining about how I was supposed to arrive at 2am, how she has been up for one hour more than she thought she would, etc.. I had sent a message to my wife that my flight was delayed, but my MIL thought that I should have sent her a message aswell, even though I didn't know she would also be waiting for me. My wife calmed her mother down and I told them that I was going to sleep. That was apparently another thing for my MIL to start complaining. She thought that I needed to empty my suitcase before I go to sleep. My wife stood up for me and told her mother that I don't need to empty it right now and I can do it in the morning when I wake up. They argued for a little while, but finally I got my permission to go to sleep from my MIL. At this point I need to say that I left my suitcase closed and it was out of the way, standing near a wall. 
Fast forward to next morning, when my wife and I woke up to a scream from my MIL. Both of us got straight up from bed and went to see what happened. My MIL stood horrified in the middle of our living room and she was looking at my suitcase, which now was laying open on the floor. My wife asked what happened and my MIL responded that she had ""accidentally"" spilled coffee in my suitcase, because I had left it laying open on the floor. My wife and I both knew she was lying, because I did not leave the suitcase like that. I looked at my suitcase and immediatelly realised that the amount of coffee in my suitcase didn't match the size of the cup my MIL was holding, because the cup was small and there were lots of coffee in the suitcase. I started crying, because everything that I had in the suitcase was ruined. My MIL started saying I was overreacting and I shouldn't have left my suitcase laying around like that. She said I was an AH because I blamed her for what happened. At this point my wife kicked her mother out and comforted me. 

Now that few days have passed, I have started thinking that maybe I overreacted and it really was my fault that my MIL spilled the coffee in the suitcase. So am I the asshole?",29,13,13,0.93,0,,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13t33kp/aita_for_getting_my_mil_kicked_out_after_she/,False,False
180,AmItheAsshole,2023-05-27 09:38:15,I_Dont_Exist_Bitch,"AITA for leaving after hearing a friend ""makeout"" for over 20 minutes?","I (m21) was hanging out with some friends tonight. My buddy (m21) had invited this girl (21) he'd been fwb with in the past to hang out with a bunch of our friends. Hangout eventually ends and me, my buddy, and the girl all head back to my buddy's place. We had a few drinks and smoked a little before calling it a night. I crashed on an air mattress in the living room while my buddy and this girl take his bed. (They're friends and share the bed fairly often, and have never done anything but sleep in said bed when people stay over after hanging out)

 Now his place has a really open floor plan, so his bedroom is pretty open so I can hear everything thats happening in there. He and I have a system. No sex when the other is there, neither of us wanna hear what the other sounds like in the sack lol.

 We laid down for bed and I ended up scrolling for a few before I heard something weird from his bedroom. Tonight was apparently the night he stopped giving a fuck about our rule because I could hear him and her groaning and her quietly gasping and his bed creaking FOR 20 MINUTES. I sent him a warning text that I could hear ""something"" but I ended up having to yell at them that I could hear them.

 They got really quiet and said they weren't doing anything but I ended up saying that they weren't being subtle and should cut it out since I can hear all of it.

 NOT 10 MINUTES LATER I HEAR IT AGAIN, albeit quieter this time. I texted a different friend and told her what was up and she told me that I should definitely just head home. So I lied to my buddy and said my roommate needed a ride home from his girlfriend's place but he said that he could tell I was lying and to just tell him the truth. I told him I didn't like hearing whatever was happening in his bedroom and that it kinda grossed me out.

 He said that nothing was happening and they were just making out.

 I tried to explain that I don't want to be at his place when he's doing stuff like that and he seemed upset that I thought that ""anything like that"" was happening. 

I get that I don't know what exactly they were doing in there, and I have a lot of stuff weighing heavy on me recently so I could have just snapped over something small. I know I have a short fuse and that night had already lasted way longer than I wanted it to. I felt like my boundaries were crossed and it made me upset.

So AITA?",10,4,4,0.75,0,,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13t322k/aita_for_leaving_after_hearing_a_friend_makeout/,False,False
