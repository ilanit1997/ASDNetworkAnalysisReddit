25,26,yes,Anxiety,2022-08-14 06:19:01,luna_bea_tuna,How risky is it to stay at a higher Venlafaxine / Effexor dose than prescribed?,"I’ve been on a prescribed 150mg venlafaxin dose for 6 months for anxiety (social, gad) and depression. Was working well for managing both. Depression came back (constant suicide ideation, spinning out) due to a period of higher stress, and I decided to up my dose to 225mg, as I was out of town and not able to see my doctor or therapist and didn’t know what else to do. After 4 weeks on 225mg I feel better than I did on 150mg, better at managing social situations and depressive episodes, though it may also be because the high stress period is gone. I saw my doctor finally and she said I should not go above 150mg (effect of the drug is not much higher but side effects would be much higher) and instead prescribed another medication to complement venlafaxin for depression. 

But given that I feel better on 225mg…I kind of want to stay on this dosage for longer and not add another drug. Talking more with her is probably the best move, instead of just not listening and taking 3x75mg and not 150mg + the new medication.

From what I’ve read in this subreddit many people are on 225mg or higher so I’m just a little unsure about if I should just keep going with what feels right or follow my doctors advice?",0,1,1,0.67,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='wnzb4u')>,,/r/Anxiety/comments/wnzb4u/how_risky_is_it_to_stay_at_a_higher_venlafaxine/,,,False,True

And then that need to not talk continued for the next few hours after we arrived home. I haven’t said a word, and just communicated with gestures and nods. I haven’t felt like I need quiet or time alone right now (which I often do), and haven’t been ignoring my family, just not talking. And it’s felt very calming.

27,28,yes,Anxiety,2022-07-12 16:51:57,luna_bea_tuna,I can't plan anything by myself,"A bit of background: I'm married and have a 2 year old, and work a 9-5 job. We live abroad away from family so don't really have any help taking care of our son. All that is to say I find my normal responsibilities tend to fill my time and am generally bad about making time for myself, though I do get some hours here and there for hobbies.

  
Last year I started taking medication for anxiety and depression (which in retrospect I have had my entire life. Neat!) and seeing a therapist. I went on sick leave due to ongoing anxiety attacks about a new job, and suffered the usual dreading waking up everyday and seeing no point in life. You know, the usual. Eventually I changed jobs and along with the medication and therapy got past the anxiety.

For the first time in years, I now have a week off to myself (wife and kid are visiting family and I'm on vacation), and I find it impossible to plan something fun to do by myself. Usually I am so overwhelmed being around other people that I keep imagining I will go off on a hiking trip by myself and just get away from everyone. 

But when it comes down to planning a trip, even just a day trip, I get tunnel vision and have trouble focusing and generally feel short of breath and overwhelmed. I'm so uncertain and overwhelmed about where to go, what gear I should buy (and should I even buy gear for a one or two time thing), if I actually want to go on a trip, what I even want to do. And I am so afraid of making the wrong choice, that I just don't choose. And then my whole ''deal'' of wanting to get away from everyone is revealed to be an obtainable fantasy, or just not really what I want. And then the question is what do I want to do with the precious free time I have.

This is pretty typical for me planning ANYTHING, that I either waste my time in indecision, or give up. Generally my wife does all the planning, and I can help her make decisions...but when it comes to myself I'm hopeless.

Maybe it means that I need to plan something with a friend, but for just this once I don't want to have be following what someone else wants to do, or needing to ask for help or borrow gear or...maybe its unrealistic given it's something I've never done before.

I don't know if this is a rant or a cry for help / suggestions. Maybe I just needed to get these thoughts out of my head right now.

231,232,yes,Anxiety,2022-04-23 19:30:52,No_Boysenberry_7138,Opinions on minfulness/meditation as a person with anxiety?,"I know some people with anxiety struggle to practice mindfulness. Personally I find that practicing some form of mindfulness/meditation practice consistency is incredibly beneficial. But sometimes it can get hard to continue a practice if for example my anxiety is a bit high - then it takes a lot of willpower to not just go on autopilot. Although of course meditation does help me **a lot** with anxiety. It doesn't necessarily completely get rid of it, but it is the most consistent, simple, and helpful way to improve my wellbeing I have.

One thing I found helpful when it comes to meditation is to not feel bad if I can't follow a rigid practice. I often just put on a 10-minute timer and count my breaths(without focusing on them) as my main practice, but if some part of my body feels a lil uncomfortable, I don't hesitate to stretch it, move it a little(like a slow wiggle), or just hold it with my hand/s.",3,2,2,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='uacxhh')>,,/r/Anxiety/comments/uacxhh/opinions_on_minfulnessmeditation_as_a_person_with/,,,False,True

I have a really hard time expressing my feelings. The symptoms I lost below, I haven’t been able to explain it during my past therapy sessions. I’m planning on writing these down and giving it to my psychiatrist in my next visit. I desperately feel alone and want to know if anyone experiences these issues. 
__

In the middle of a conversation I will just zone out. I get quiet and feel a lost of energy and just want to be alone and notice I start speaking very quietly basically like whispering. I don’t know why this happens

I seem to always make things about myself in conversations it’s the only way I know how to relate but my friends have noticed and they say it’s quite annoying 


I take a lot of things literal and don’t know when someone is serious or joking 

Everyone says my humor isn’t funny and quite confusing, I guess the way I see things are very different to others.

I find it so hard to do simple things. My room can never stay organized. First, it takes me ages to bring myself to clean and then a few days later it’s suddenly messy again and it’s just an ongoing cycle. The problem is I see the mess and I really want to clean up but I can’t bring myself to do it. And when I finally do it , it makes me feel so exhausted. L

I can be very decisive and impulsive. My friends have mentioned a lot how I say things without thinking and sometimes it’s blunt and quite rude. 

I also forget what I had just said like a minute before moving on to another topic. 

I have trouble recognizing people’s facial expressions and tones. Sometimes I can’t tell whether people are happy or upset with me. And people always say it’s hard to interact with me because the things I say they never know if I’m joking or serious because my facial expressions and tone are out of sync.


I go through so many phases of hyper focusing on things and it’s something I can’t stop thinking about until I wind up losing interest. And I ramble on about it and talk about it as much as I can with friends and family. It’s quite embarrassing but I can’t help myself.

When I get excited I flap my hands and jump up and down. I know it looks childish so I try not to. 

When I’m stressed I need to fidget with my fidget toys but they don’t seem to help much. The way I can explain it is that I feel like I have electricity running through me and there’s no way to let it out. I feel irritable a lot of the time because I don’t know how to explain how it feels inside my body and brain. 



Sometimes I randomly feel like I need to cry  

Big crowds overwhelm me, not because I’m scared of people it just feels like too much going on around me with noise,  lights and people. 

I like to plan things ahead of time. I don’t like when plans are changed.

I get attached to people so easily like a child and I hate it so much

It’s very hard for me to finish any assignment up until the last minute. No matter if I enjoy it or don’t the only thing that pushes me is until the last few minutes it’s due.

I go from one extreme to the other. For example I can be very excited to extremely disappointed. If I get critiqued on something I go and do the complete opposite I don’t know how to be balanced. 

I find it hard to follow instructions with more than one step involved, unless clearly laid out in written form. I require everyone to be very clear with me, otherwise I won't feel able to complete a task. I know this will only get worst once I get a job if I can even get one",3,2,2,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='11ss4f3')>,,/r/Anxiety/comments/11ss4f3/anyone_diagnosed_with_gad_and_something_else_that/,,,False,True

I get heavy anxity attack when trying to chat with my close friend who I met online since long time ( I used to chat with her daily but this issue didn't exist). I notice this issue comes when I chat particularly girls but not all of them. Although I don't feel worried while texting. 

Yet there are physical symptoms as muscle aches, chest tightness and brainfog and sometimes full collapse by simply sending a message or reading the messages in the chat window. They persist for sometime..

I noticed similar issue starting since 2021, when I studdenly started getting this feeling with some girls i chat with online. But wasn't noticed much and fine most of the time. Now it is getting worse, the whole chat is very friendly.

Based on my search it seems something related to hyperstimulation anxiety that could be linked to such event.

On real life I don't feel such symptoms although I sometimes feel nervous when chatting to a girl but I really do it and don't care at all and no symptoms.

I used to have general anxiety and social anxiety before but I used to expose myself to the event and it would ease as I challenge it and feel awesome later. But this situation doesn't look similar even with the symptoms.


Any suggestion? It is really frustrating..

35,36,,Anxiety,2023-05-27 07:27:40,Caitm8911,Feeling ignored. (This is may have gone on a tangent),"For the past 2 years, I've been talking to my dad about getting my drivers license. He promised he would take me to do a G1 test as soon as I was able to. The day came where I was able to and he initially said that I couldn't do my drivers test unless my brother did too (for context, my brother has said his whole life that he doesn't want to get his drivers license). After arguing with him and talking with my brother, he suddenly moved to the topic of how I'm missing school too often, so he won't take me to do my G1, until I start showing up to school. He's been saying this since November 2022 and its extremely irritating and kind of makes me feel like I'm being ignored. 

I have an anxiety disorder and I have a really difficult time with leaving the house. I've always been like this and he's never understood, but now that I have a diagnosis and I'm more open about how I'm feeling, I was hoping he'd be more understanding. My anxiety has gotten bad recently and I haven't been showing up to school at all. I've been asking if he could at least take me to go drive, as I haven't driven in months (winter roads are not great). He says he'll take me once I show up to school. What I don't think he's grasping is the fact that I am not choosing to stay home. Like I guess I am, but it's not like I wake up and think ""school sucks I'm not going today"". Its more of me panicking the second I wake up. The other morning I literally started sobbing when asking my dad to let me stay home. Despite his knowledge of how horrible I've been feeling, he still insists he won't do anything for me until I go to school. I think he believes that it'll motivate me, but it's really making me feel ignored. 

I just wish he'd take me and my mental health seriously, instead of telling me I'm just ""irresponsible"" and ""lazy"". 

It's frustrating when someone who's supposed to support you, is brushing you off. I've had countless discussions about my mental health with him, last year my dad literally watched me have panic attacks multiple times a day, and it feels like he still doesn't get what I am dealing with. I don't expect him to fully understand, but I want him to at least try and empathize.

I feel the need to tell someone about this, but I don't want to irritate my friend. I plan on bringing it up to my dad, I'm just worried I'm going to end up crying in front of him or something.
