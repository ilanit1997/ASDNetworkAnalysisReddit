41,Anxiety,2022-08-14 06:19:01,luna_bea_tuna,How risky is it to stay at a higher Venlafaxine / Effexor dose than prescribed?,"I’ve been on a prescribed 150mg venlafaxin dose for 6 months for anxiety (social, gad) and depression. Was working well for managing both. Depression came back (constant suicide ideation, spinning out) due to a period of higher stress, and I decided to up my dose to 225mg, as I was out of town and not able to see my doctor or therapist and didn’t know what else to do. After 4 weeks on 225mg I feel better than I did on 150mg, better at managing social situations and depressive episodes, though it may also be because the high stress period is gone. I saw my doctor finally and she said I should not go above 150mg (effect of the drug is not much higher but side effects would be much higher) and instead prescribed another medication to complement venlafaxin for depression. 

But given that I feel better on 225mg…I kind of want to stay on this dosage for longer and not add another drug. Talking more with her is probably the best move, instead of just not listening and taking 3x75mg and not 150mg + the new medication.

From what I’ve read in this subreddit many people are on 225mg or higher so I’m just a little unsure about if I should just keep going with what feels right or follow my doctors advice?",0,1,1,0.67,0,,/r/Anxiety/comments/wnzb4u/how_risky_is_it_to_stay_at_a_higher_venlafaxine/,False,True
42,Anxiety,2022-08-13 18:04:15,luna_bea_tuna,Sometimes I guess I don’t want to talk/use verbal language,"Today after spending a few hours at a very busy and loud beach with wife and son (2 year old), we biked home and in the ride my wife was trying to talk to me. I am anxious biking in the city as it is, so any effort on top of paying 100% attention to my surroundings while biking bumps up my anxiety. I usually get frustrated and annoyed or angry in that situation but this time I realised that I don’t Need to respond. And then that need to not talk continued for the next few hours after we arrived home. I haven’t said a word, and just communicated with gestures and nods. I haven’t felt like I need quiet or time alone right now (which I often do), and haven’t been ignoring my family, just not talking. And it’s felt very calming. I’d like try to do this more often when I feel overwhelmed, instead of freaking out or feeling like I need to hide.

43,Anxiety,2022-07-12 16:51:57,luna_bea_tuna,I can't plan anything by myself,"A bit of background: I'm married and have a 2 year old, and work a 9-5 job. We live abroad away from family so don't really have any help taking care of our son. All that is to say I find my normal responsibilities tend to fill my time and am generally bad about making time for myself, though I do get some hours here and there for hobbies.

  
Last year I started taking medication for anxiety and depression (which in retrospect I have had my entire life. Neat!) and seeing a therapist. I went on sick leave due to ongoing anxiety attacks about a new job, and suffered the usual dreading waking up everyday and seeing no point in life. You know, the usual. Eventually I changed jobs and along with the medication and therapy got past the anxiety.

For the first time in years, I now have a week off to myself (wife and kid are visiting family and I'm on vacation), and I find it impossible to plan something fun to do by myself. Usually I am so overwhelmed being around other people that I keep imagining I will go off on a hiking trip by myself and just get away from everyone. 

But when it comes down to planning a trip, even just a day trip, I get tunnel vision and have trouble focusing and generally feel short of breath and overwhelmed. I'm so uncertain and overwhelmed about where to go, what gear I should buy (and should I even buy gear for a one or two time thing), if I actually want to go on a trip, what I even want to do. And I am so afraid of making the wrong choice, that I just don't choose. And then my whole ''deal'' of wanting to get away from everyone is revealed to be an obtainable fantasy, or just not really what I want. And then the question is what do I want to do with the precious free time I have.

This is pretty typical for me planning ANYTHING, that I either waste my time in indecision, or give up. Generally my wife does all the planning, and I can help her make decisions...but when it comes to myself I'm hopeless.

Maybe it means that I need to plan something with a friend, but for just this once I don't want to have be following what someone else wants to do, or needing to ask for help or borrow gear or...maybe its unrealistic given it's something I've never done before.

I don't know if this is a rant or a cry for help / suggestions. Maybe I just needed to get these thoughts out of my head right now.

182,Anxiety,2022-04-23 19:30:52,No_Boysenberry_7138,Opinions on minfulness/meditation as a person with anxiety?,"I know some people with anxiety struggle to practice mindfulness. Personally I find that practicing some form of mindfulness/meditation practice consistency is incredibly beneficial. But sometimes it can get hard to continue a practice if for example my anxiety is a bit high - then it takes a lot of willpower to not just go on autopilot. Although of course meditation does help me **a lot** with anxiety. It doesn't necessarily completely get rid of it, but it is the most consistent, simple, and helpful way to improve my wellbeing I have.

One thing I found helpful when it comes to meditation is to not feel bad if I can't follow a rigid practice. I often just put on a 10-minute timer and count my breaths(without focusing on them) as my main practice, but if some part of my body feels a lil uncomfortable, I don't hesitate to stretch it, move it a little(like a slow wiggle), or just hold it with my hand/s.",3,2,2,1.0,0,,/r/Anxiety/comments/uacxhh/opinions_on_minfulnessmeditation_as_a_person_with/,False,True

639,Anxiety,2023-03-16 12:02:27,Hour_Apple_2929,Anyone diagnosed with GAD and something else that explains these symptoms?,"I’m 22 and diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. I have a really hard time expressing my feelings. The symptoms I lost below, I haven’t been able to explain it during my past therapy sessions. I’m planning on writing these down and giving it to my psychiatrist in my next visit. I desperately feel alone and want to know if anyone experiences these issues. 
__

In the middle of a conversation I will just zone out. I get quiet and feel a lost of energy and just want to be alone and notice I start speaking very quietly basically like whispering. I don’t know why this happens

I seem to always make things about myself in conversations it’s the only way I know how to relate but my friends have noticed and they say it’s quite annoying 


I take a lot of things literal and don’t know when someone is serious or joking 

Everyone says my humor isn’t funny and quite confusing, I guess the way I see things are very different to others.

I find it so hard to do simple things. My room can never stay organized. First, it takes me ages to bring myself to clean and then a few days later it’s suddenly messy again and it’s just an ongoing cycle. The problem is I see the mess and I really want to clean up but I can’t bring myself to do it. And when I finally do it , it makes me feel so exhausted. L

I can be very decisive and impulsive. My friends have mentioned a lot how I say things without thinking and sometimes it’s blunt and quite rude. 

I also forget what I had just said like a minute before moving on to another topic. 

I have trouble recognizing people’s facial expressions and tones. Sometimes I can’t tell whether people are happy or upset with me. And people always say it’s hard to interact with me because the things I say they never know if I’m joking or serious because my facial expressions and tone are out of sync.


I go through so many phases of hyper focusing on things and it’s something I can’t stop thinking about until I wind up losing interest. And I ramble on about it and talk about it as much as I can with friends and family. It’s quite embarrassing but I can’t help myself.

When I get excited I flap my hands and jump up and down. I know it looks childish so I try not to. 

When I’m stressed I need to fidget with my fidget toys but they don’t seem to help much. The way I can explain it is that I feel like I have electricity running through me and there’s no way to let it out. I feel irritable a lot of the time because I don’t know how to explain how it feels inside my body and brain. 



Sometimes I randomly feel like I need to cry  

Big crowds overwhelm me, not because I’m scared of people it just feels like too much going on around me with noise,  lights and people. 

I like to plan things ahead of time. I don’t like when plans are changed.

I get attached to people so easily like a child and I hate it so much

It’s very hard for me to finish any assignment up until the last minute. No matter if I enjoy it or don’t the only thing that pushes me is until the last few minutes it’s due.

I go from one extreme to the other. For example I can be very excited to extremely disappointed. If I get critiqued on something I go and do the complete opposite I don’t know how to be balanced. 

I find it hard to follow instructions with more than one step involved, unless clearly laid out in written form. I require everyone to be very clear with me, otherwise I won't feel able to complete a task. I know this will only get worst once I get a job if I can even get one",3,2,2,1.0,0,,/r/Anxiety/comments/11ss4f3/anyone_diagnosed_with_gad_and_something_else_that/,False,True

That was in 2019.

My parents are fine BTW. 

I feel like my fear is different from other fearful flyers because I don't worry about turbulence or other things, it's like my brain is telling me all the time that I am the target of a disaster and these thoughts are so intense I can't distinguish my fear from reality.

I found it almost impossible to answer calls or texts with one after another. I can't explain it, I just panic and think I should reply when I'm feeling less crazy, which starts the cycle of ""I'll feel better when I reply.....I'll reply when I feel better"" and I just wind up ghosting people. I totally dropped off of social media around 2016 as well, I panic just thinking about it.

I had an abortion summer last year, and although I was confident in my decision I still feel overwhelming guilt (raised catholic lol). I didn't know how to talk to my best friend about it so I ghosted her about a year ago. 

Every single day I feel deeply ashamed and scared that I've ruined these relationships forever. Nightmares of my friends I abandoned at least a few times a week.

several times a night, i will check on my two dogs and my partner to make sure they’re all breathing. this causes my sleeping issues to get even worse. i can’t sleep until i’m exhausted enough to forget the possibility of them dying. 

if i don’t know what someone’s doing (mom, dad, brother), i worry something VERY bad has happened. i can’t focus on anything else until i’m sure they’re okay. which can get hard when my brother and i don’t really speak, but i still care about him very much. with my parents, i can always call them. 

i just need some advice. i’m so sick of constantly being worried someone/my dogs are going to die. it’s really ruining the time i do have with these people.

15,Anxiety,2023-05-27 11:00:20,ToyLollipop,Anxiety ruins the relationship with my family (thoughts of suicide),"Yesterday, we had to celebrate children's day earlier. I decided to come at the place where it celebrated together with my mom. We arrived and I saw lots of children and teens there. It was a stadium where the celebration had place. I wanted to come there because maybe I could meet someone, but apparently, I wasn't prepared. There was someone who invited me to stay next to them. I did, but I never talked because I feared to say something stupid. My mom eventually called me and told me there were some exclassmates I could go and talk to. I couldn't find them. I was too afraid to see someone that I could accidentally make eye contact. I saw lots of people I know having fun and I had the feeling that I didn't know what to do. I only wanted to crouch and cry. (I know that people don't have any problems with me, but I can't stop the thoughts of people who look at me and call me a loser or a weirdo. I always think that every move I do will lead to harsh concequences. I shouldn't view life like that, yet I hate myself for not stopping. It was my fault for being a crybaby and acting jealous at school anyway. No one thought of me as a great person because of that, and so I tried to perfect myself as much as possible, and I still think I'm not enough.)

My mom saw me do that. Usually when I have panick attacks, my mom would try to confort me, but that time she got angry, took my arm and forced me to go home. She would tell me all the time we were walking home about the fact that she is tired of waiting for me to finally open up, to talk to people. She is tired to see me stay quiet. She saw me staying with that girl and told me ""she invited you to stay and talk to her, yet you didn't say anything like a stupid bitch"", telling me that I need to go to a psychiatrist (to be honest, I wouldn't mind that, but of course she won't take me to one because she thinks I don't actually need one). One thing that made me feel like killing myself is that she bans me from talking to a friend of mine, who I have a lot in common with because ""you literally sold your soul for that friendship and you wouldn't talk to anyone else."" I think of it as a hypocritical move because she was the one who recommended me to talk to the person in the first place.

I thought that my mom has changed because she finally observed that I suffer. I guess I was mistaken. She wouldn't listen to me anymore. When my dad heard of this, he got pissed on my mom and reminded her of my heart condition and that her behaviour leads us to nothing. He then accused her for breaking my arm (which it wasn't even broken). Later, my dad asked me about what happened after we left from the stadium. Then he told me that my behaviour is mainly influenced of my internet activity, that he'll throw away my gadgets. I was always afraid that they will probably end up divorcing because of me. My mom told me several years ago that they mostly fight because of me.

I am afraid of becoming any of my parents. I don't want to become like my mother because of her manipulative tendencies (that I recently discovered) and I don't want to become like my dad, who's overly protective. At this point I don't know if I should kill myself or not because I've got no one. Yet I'm too afraid of death. I can't even get proper help. Maybe when I'll finally have my own life, things will get better.

Comparative with the anxiety I have right now, I am now better since I can talk with other people and express myself (at least used to) than when I was smaller.

What I mean is, for example, I work at a music venue. A huge, very long music venue. It takes about 10 minutes to walk from one side to the other. If I'm leading my crew to do a job, or taking a group of new hires to do some training and I am in front of the group, it feels like I have forgotten how to walk. My right leg feels paralyzed while my left leg goes completely loose and feels like it's flopping around.

I started a new construction job this week, it is in a remote area and for a good company. In this industry due to high risk nature of work we are subjected to random drug and alcohol tests to make sure we are fit for the dangerous environment.

I started on the same day as another guy who is the same age as me. We are discussing the random drug and alcohol tests. 

I mentioned that in my previous company I failed a drug and alcohol test. I tested positive for cannabis after smoking a couple of joints on my birthday and getting tested when I returned to site. 

I told him I regret it massively and don't smoke any more as a result. 

That seemed fine, we continued talking about drugs and drug experiences.  He mentioned that he sometimes enjoys cocaine sparingly.

I told him I no longer take any stimulants after being sold Crystal Meth when I tried to purchase MD. This seemed fine at the time as well, he asked what it was like, if I stayed up for days etc.

However since then (three days ago) he is acting much more distant with me. We were forced to ride together in the car today and he started complaining about people failing drug tests and telling crazy stories in the work place.

I was taken aback, I thought my stories were appropriate given the topic of discussion was drugs and he mentioned doing cocaine. I told them in the spirit of being honest about who I am and my experiences in life.

I got the vibe he is trying to bring me down, as if he thought I'd done something terribly wrong and he knows better about how to behave around a construction site.

So I went to school in college earlier and cant help but notice the group of mean kids laughing at me as i walked by them all because i tried to say hi to one of their friends who is a girl (and i thought that they think i like her but no ew im gay she just seems approachable but i guess she's nothing but a bitch) so i figured that they might be teasing her and think that im weird and it would be fun .

27,Anxiety,2023-05-27 08:55:57,digital_2020,"Propranolol, anxiety and reconsolidation of the memories","So, recently, I became aware that there are some recent research and innovative applications of propranolol regarding the healing of PTSD/Anxiety symptoms.  
  
I have read some research materials, and it appears that the main mechanism of healing is achieved by taking propranolol approximately one hour before retrieving a disturbing memory. It is believed that during the active period of the medication, the emotional response associated with the memory is either removed or reduced when the memory is reconsolidated.  
  
Does anyone have any experience with this? What are your thoughts on whether this could be a viable approach to healing?  
  
Thanks in advance!  
  
PS: Also I'm also adding ChatGPT response below on this matter:  
  
**How propranolol can be used to heal ptsd and heal negative emotional response from memories?**  
  
*Propranolol is a medication primarily used to treat conditions such as high blood pressure, angina (chest pain), and certain heart rhythm disorders. While it is not approved by regulatory authorities as a specific treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), some studies have explored its potential use in reducing the emotional intensity associated with traumatic memories.*  
  
*The concept behind using propranolol for PTSD is based on the idea that the drug may interfere with the process of memory reconsolidation, which is the stabilization and re-storage of memories when they are recalled. By administering propranolol shortly after a traumatic event or during the recollection of traumatic memories, the hope is that it may disrupt the emotional response associated with those memories, potentially reducing the intensity of PTSD symptoms.*  
  
*It's important to note that the use of propranolol for PTSD is still a subject of ongoing research, and its efficacy and safety for this purpose are not yet fully established. The results from studies have been mixed, and more research is needed to determine its long-term effects, optimal dosing, and potential benefits and risks.*  
  
**What might be the mechanism of propranolol healing effect with regard to memory reconsolidation**  
  
*The exact mechanism by which propranolol may affect memory reconsolidation is not fully understood. However, there are a few proposed theories regarding its potential healing effects on traumatic memories and emotional responses:*  
  
*Noradrenergic modulation: Propranolol is a beta-blocker that primarily acts by blocking beta-adrenergic receptors. One theory suggests that traumatic memories and their associated emotional responses involve heightened activity in the noradrenergic system, which is involved in the stress response. By blocking beta-adrenergic receptors, propranolol may reduce the release of norepinephrine, a stress hormone, and thereby interfere with the emotional consolidation of traumatic memories.*  
  
*Disruption of memory reconsolidation: When memories are recalled, they enter a labile state known as reconsolidation, during which they are susceptible to modification or disruption. Propranolol, when administered around the time of memory retrieval, may interfere with the reconsolidation process, weakening the emotional intensity associated with the memory. This disruption may lead to a reduction in the negative emotional response to the memory over time.*  
  
*Contextual memory impairment: Another proposed mechanism is that propranolol may impair the contextual memory associated with traumatic events. Contextual memory refers to the details and environmental cues associated with a particular memory. By disrupting the contextual memory, propranolol may weaken the emotional response tied to the traumatic event.*  
  
*It's important to note that while these theories provide possible explanations for the effects of propranolol on memory reconsolidation, further research is needed to fully understand its mechanisms and confirm its effectiveness in treating PTSD or reducing the emotional impact of traumatic memories.*",0,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/Anxiety/comments/13t2d3c/propranolol_anxiety_and_reconsolidation_of_the/,False,False
28,Anxiety,2023-05-27 08:50:27,IiTossiI,Anxiety switches every few weeks,"Hello, I'm new to this subreddit and I need some advice with my anxiety.

My anxiety started a year ago. Few weeks ago I've noticed that my fears change every week.
Month ago I had a fear of having some terrible neurological disease.
Week ago I thought that every food was spoiled/poisoned and I didn't eat anything.
Yesterday a black cat went past me and for some reason my anxiety was like ""that cat gave you rabies"".
And that happens every few weeks...
Does anyone have anything similar to this?",7,2,2,1.0,0,,/r/Anxiety/comments/13t29v1/anxiety_switches_every_few_weeks/,False,False
29,Anxiety,2023-05-27 08:47:33,eerie_fondness,Anxious 24/7,"I’m 21, I’ve checked my physical health and I’m fine so we rule that out (except sinus tachycardia and ibs which both are caused by my stress). 

So I legit cannot relax. My heart rate won’t drop from 80 when I’m resting, I wake up in panic, heart rate can reach 140, my ibs is AWFUL every morning. I can barely get up from the bed in the mornings because of my heart rate and ibs symptoms. I’ve been in therapy for almost a year but it didn’t help me at all so I stopped. It felt as if I’m wasting money. My therapist put me in group therapy after 3 months of starting therapy and I never liked it. I was telling her but she kept insisting on telling me group therapy is better. She didn’t diagnose me with anything although I’m positive I have anxiety and OCD. 

Anxiety has made me agoraphobic and I can’t live my life at all. I never give up though and the last few days I’ve gone out by myself and I succeeded, I try to no longer listen anxiety and do whatever I want. It’s so hard, it feels as if it’s a lost battle but from the things I’ve read it’s the only way to get better. 

I’d like you to tell me techniques on how to cope with anxiety and if you’re any tell me your stories with anxiety.",0,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/Anxiety/comments/13t286l/anxious_247/,False,False
