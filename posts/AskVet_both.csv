57,AskVet,2021-10-23 05:51:26,Putrid-Occasion1881,Can repeated exposure to marijuana smoke cause nerve damage in a cat?,"My friend's roommate's cat is a 14 year old overweight tabby cat who lives day and night in the kitchen. He can't go outside because he has severe allergies. Both him and his roommate regularly smoke weed indoors for medical purposes. My friend smokes in his room across the house from the kitchen with the door shut, windows open and makes reasonable efforts to keep the smell from traveling to the rest of the house, which roommate has said works well. The roommate is currently sleeping in the living room for unrelated reasons. He only smokes stiizy pods though the living room connects directly with the kitchen. The kitchen does have a door on it that always remains shut. 

Recently the cat was seen acting very lethargic and later was unable to walk properly. The roommate took the cat to the vet but when he returned he told my friend that the vet had asked him directly if anyone in the house smoked marijuana and then said that the reason for the cat's behavior was that it was being exposed so regularly to weed that it was constantly high and it was causing neurological damage. The cat is receiving treatment and is recovering well and my roommate no longer smokes in the house but my question is more about how a vet would come to this conclusion. Is it possible that it's so obvious weed was causing the issue that the vet felt confident to ask for it specifically? The roommate also said that the vet specified that a stiizy wouldn't be able to cause the damage in the way a bong or dab rig could which would make sense except that the roommate has confirmed themself that the efforts my friend had been putting into masking the smell had been effective and also my friend is across the house and the smoke would have to travel and get through a couple of doors. And yes, while a stiizy isn't nearly as strong, repeated use throughout the entire day still leaves the house smelling just as if you've been smoking from a dab all day and it wouldn't be hard to make it into the kitchen if people are regularly opening the door to go in and out. 

My friend and I are just really confused as to the circumstances of the diagnosis, especially since he's basically receiving all the blame. Also I apologize for the nature of the question, we realize exposing an animal to weed at all isn't ok so I just want to reiterate that the cat is receiving treatment, is recovering well, and weed is no longer being smoked around the cat.",3,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/AskVet/comments/qdyx49/can_repeated_exposure_to_marijuana_smoke_cause/,False,True

I took him to the emergency vet 2 days ago to get a urinary blockage cleared. since he's been home I have been giving him the pain medicine and feeding him a urinary health diet (iams urinary health dry food). I also purchased a pet water fountain to encourage him to drink and have witnessed him drinking often. I am very concerned because he has not been able to urinate since he came home from the vet. I have watched him strain but not succeed. 

my problem is that I cannot afford to pay for further treatment and so I don't know what to do for him. Clearing the blockage the first time was very expensive and I am a single person who is only able to work part time due to health reasons. I don't want him to suffer and so I'm wondering if there is any way I can get help for him or even surrender him (which of course I don't want to do because I love him so much) somewhere where he can be treated.",42,28,28,0.89,0,,/r/AskVet/comments/13arar4/cat_unable_to_urinate_after_getting_blockage/,False,True
1526,AskVet,2022-04-22 13:45:51,Naima92231,Seasonal/vaccine-related seizures in 5-6-year-old dog?,"Hello. I have a very healthy 6-year-old Pit/Boxer mix (about 52 lbs.) whom I adopted from a shelter when she was a few months old. Aside from occasional GI issues (short-lived, and never terribly serious--the usual stuff), she's never had a health problem. She IS, however, an anxious dog who gets nervous when things change, or aren't in their usual places, etc. She falls in love with everyone she meets, but is very unwilling to go on walks, etc., with anyone except me. She is a sweetheart.
About 2 years ago, around May or early June, she had her first two 2 relatively mild seizure events (no loss of consciousness or ""paddling""--just unable to stand, shaking violently, smacking her lips, and looking terrified) about a week apart. Her vet checked her blood, and said that everything looked normal. There were no more incidents until...
The following spring, last year, she went to the vet 2 separate times within a few weeks for her boosters and rabies shots. Within between a few days to about 3 weeks after both visits, she had multiple instances of the same kind of events of varying length and severity (again, no loss of consciousness, etc., although one time she lost control of her bowels, which would NEVER happen otherwise).
I talked to the vet about it, and she asked me to keep a log. I also asked her about CBD, and, although she couldn't ""officially"" recommend it, she did say that some of her patients had had good results with it. So I started her on CBD oil--.5 ml. of 1200 mg. oil 2x per day.
A week after we started the CBD oil (I believe it takes a little time to start working), she had another 9-minute long episode (I got video of that one). It was awful, but, as usual when it ended she was back to normal and just wanted to go outside. That was 23 days after her last booster last year. It was on April 30th, and she had no more until...
Exactly one week after THIS year's boosters, which were given on 30 March, she had another episode. She was shaking so hard I was terrified she'd die. After about 5 very long minutes, she was fine again.
(I should also mention that she had an apparently benign mast cell tumor removed from near one of her nipples a few months ago, in winter, and she's recovered well, except that she is now terrified of the vet's office...understandably, as the procedure was no doubt really frightening for her. But there were no subsequent seizures then.)
Sorry for the long background story!
Of course I started to associate the seizure events as being related to the vaccinations, but I've seen very little reliable info online making that correlation, and the vet says it's not likely. But why do they always happen only in the spring, and within a few weeks of boosters?
The other thing I learned from ""Dr. Google, Veterinary Edition"" is that boosters for distemper/parvo/bordatella, etc., only usually need to be given every THREE years--NOT every year, as we've been doing per the vet office's suggestions. I've also read that multiple vaccinations boosters given at one time might be too much.
So...long story short... could this all somehow be coincidence? I'm wondering if (a) she's predisposed to seizures, and either the stress of the vet visits and/or the boosters themselves can trigger them, or if they can be seasonal. (I don't use fertilizers or pesticides in the yard, she doesn't go to dog parks, and we take our walks on city streets, away from other dogs. I have no plans to ever board her anywhere.)
One more thing--she's EXTREMELY heat-intolerant, which I assume is due to the Boxer in her.

2953,AskVet,2023-02-12 17:47:02,MoonyGraham37,My cat ate the smallest amount of garlic - should I get the vet involved?,"Details: my cat is 4 years old, spayed, domestic shorthair, she’s  probably 10+ pounds, and she’s extremely antisocial so taking her to the vet is a lot of stress for her. I also can’t really afford a vet trip just to hear them say she’s fine and I’m over-reacting. We also live in Connecticut, USA.

What happened:
I made dinner last night which calls for 1/16 of a teaspoon of garlic powder mixed with butter to go on top of what I made, which drips onto the plate. After I was finished I heard her lapping the plate because of the butter - I want to say 3 little licks - and then she looked up and started licking her chops so I imagine she definitely tasted the garlic. We looked at each other and I just kinda said “that’s…probably not good for you” and shoo’d her away from the plate. And then I looked it up online and apparently garlic is one of the worst things a cat can eat. Everything I’m reading says that 1/16 of a teaspoon per 5 pounds is fatal, but she’s 10 pounds and she only had a small fraction of 1/16 - just enough to taste it. Like. Literally maybe 3-5 actual specks of garlic powder.

Now:
I didn’t hear or see any vomiting and she’s acting fine this morning, but I know that it may take a couple days to a week for things to go wrong. Am I overthinking this or do you think she’ll be okay? I just need a second opinion besides my own.

TLDR; Do I need a new vet? Should I get a second opinion? Is it normal for a vet to be so dismissive with these things? He recently took over the animal hospital and the previous owners were very different and they were the only vet I've ever used. I don't want to be spending all this time and money on special food that won't help him lose weight either if allergies are most likely not the issue. I guess I just feel like I'm failing him trying to be his doctor via Google, but also don't want to spend time and money finding a new vet to just be given the same vague non-advice. He's also been going to this place since he was a kitten.

Okay, the skin issue: My cat has had dandruff, scaly flaking skin, hair coming out, scabs and wounds, etc, for the past 6 months. Took him in for his wellness check and shots March 3rd. I wanted to get him on a diet and discuss the skin stuff, but I think the vet was in a hurry to leave. I even showed up a half hour early when they asked. He barely touched my cat, ran his hand up his back and said he's not able to groom because of his weight, to brush him more and feed him less. Really no guidance on either issue. 

I've used sprays and waterless baths, various brushes and combs, and nothing helps. Called them back a month later to schedule another appt and instead the receptionist said they'll give me Revolution in case there's fleas (which he was given at the beginning of April, no change). She also recommended adding omega 3 supplement oil to his food, which I did for a couple months. She also suggested it could be a food allergy which would require a limited diet. So it took me a bit to research foods, but he's been on a no chicken, fish, or turkey diet for two weeks (I stopped the Omega oil because it had fish as well). I know that could take a couple months to show improvement though.

I feel weird doing all this really without any guidance. I am still limiting his portions and measuring all his food, but it's been hard because I have been switching his wet food trying to find the best ones and the kcal in each one is different, so he's lost about a half a lb since March. I continually check for flea evidence as well. I'm afraid that this is really bothering him or that he'll get an infection before he loses enough weight or I figure out if it's a food allergy. Not asking for a diagnosis, just want to know if I'm on the right path or if I should find a new vet to help.

• Age: 8 years

• Sex/Neuter status: Male, neutered

• Breed: DSH

Body weight: 20 lbs

• History: Started approx two weeks ago, redness and fur missing from one ear, and had spread to both ears

• Clinical signs: redness, missing fur, scabbing, over grooming, overscratching, head shaking, black coffee grounds type dirt inside ear.

• Duration: two weeks

• Your general location: WI, USA

Hi, my car started showing all the signs of ear mites a couple weeks ago. At first I just thought he had accidentally scratched his ear, as only one ear was affected with redness. But last week both ears became affected, so I called the vet. They walked me through a list of symptoms to check for, and that's when I noticed the black dirt in his ears. He already has a wellness check (vaccines and a talk about his weight) scheduled for March 3rd, so the doctor said I could wait until then for treatment of the mites.

But I can tell he's miserable, and I want to make him at least comfortable until he can get in, so I called them back the next day (Thursday) and asked if there was anything else I could do. I'm already on the cancellation list, but she recommended getting some cat ear cleaner and using a cotton ball to try and clean them out.

So yesterday I went to the pet supply store and grabbed some car ear wipes, and I noticed they had ear mites drops for cats as well. I grabbed those too, would it be okay for me to try those? Idk if they would kill all the mites, but at least it might provide some relief for the next couple weeks? It's called Four Paws Aloe Ear Mite Treatment for Cats. It has pyrethrins (.05%) and piperonyl butoxide (.5%).

I just don't want to screw up any treatment the vet may have for him, or give him something that's dangerous. I know he's not officially diagnosed with mites, but the doctor and I both think that's the issue.

The only thing I can think of is that my roommate's girlfriend is currently staying with us for the week, but she's been here before and she's super sweet to him and he's never had a problem with her. He's also acting agitated right now and they're not even home.  
Please help, I don't know what to do. Something is bothering him severely and I don't know how to make him happy.",1,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/AskVet/comments/13t1myn/cat_has_been_acting_agitated_growling_and_hissing/,False,False

I called the only Vet within 4 hours of my location and they won't be back in the office until Tuesday and I don't know what to do. He's already puked up the water I syringe fed him earlier and it had a horrible smell like rotted meat?

68,AskVet,2023-05-27 07:35:00,ChoiceAutomatic5660,Luxating Medial Patella,"My cat, a 1 year old ragdoll siamese was recently diagnosed with luxating medial patella. Grade 1 in his left and 2 in his right. I initially took him to the vet for his vaccinations, but he was limping at times as well. The vet didn't recommend surgery just yet, and told me to monitor his limping at home, if he increases. So far, I see him develop the limp when he jumps up onto the couch or cat tower or when he jumps down that he develops the limp. Should I listen to the vet and wait to monitor, I am just scared he is gonna develop arthritis at this rate as his knee pops out at least 5 times today.",1,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/AskVet/comments/13t13ij/luxating_medial_patella/,False,False
69,AskVet,2023-05-27 07:31:28,space___lion,Kittens heart sound,"Hi, looking for some advice. We’re purchasing two Ragdoll kittens from the same litter. They’re 12 weeks today and we’re planning on picking them up this Sunday. Yesterday the owner went for a last check-up and the vet heard a murmur in all 3 kittens in this litter. The mom and dad have been tested for HCM and passed in the time before breeding.

The vet said that it’s possible the heart murmur will disappear on its own, but getting an echocardiogram is probably wise regardless of whether the murmur persists or not. The breeder said the vet called it a ventricular septum defect.

What should I do? The breeder offered to pay some of the costs for an echo and is also willing to make an agreement for a money-back guarantee of sorts. We’ve been waiting for these kittens since February, when the mom was pregnant.

We were very excited, but now a bit unsure. How serious is this or could this be? Should we continue or cancel?",2,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/AskVet/comments/13t11jk/kittens_heart_sound/,False,False
