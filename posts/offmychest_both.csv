404,offmychest,2023-05-20 08:12:27,East_Midnight2812,Data breach of privacy sparks anxiety and feeling physically sick on edge,"I reside in a country and neighborhood that is generally considered safe, and it's rare to encounter the police. However, last week, a cyberattack targeted the internet service provider I use, resulting in the compromise of data belonging to 50% of its customers, including myself. The origin and specifics of the attack remain unclear, but I received an email assuring that the unauthorized access had been contained, while urging vigilance against potential misuse of personal information.

Once I read that email, a wave of anxiety washed over me. I began sweating profusely, and the panic suppressed my appetite. It also triggered flashbacks to instances where I had engaged in unhinged rants online, whether on platforms like this or by limiting visibility on Facebook, leading me to worry about the possibility of these actions being used against me unexpectedly. This morning, as I awoke in a state of panic, the blaring sirens of police cars intensified my distress. From my balcony, I could see that they were stationed in front of the main office within my estate. Curiosity compelled me to consider rushing downstairs to investigate the situation and perhaps even take a photo of their license plate. The presence of a police van parked directly across from the police car added another layer of panic. Typically, I don't pay much attention to the cars parked in my apartment's car park or who occupies which spot. However, now I find myself compelled to do so.

My mind has been unable to quiet down, relentlessly conjuring up every worst-case scenario imaginable. The thought of them arriving at my doorstep any day, at any hour, has made it nearly impossible for me to find solace and sleep peacefully tonight.",0,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/offmychest/comments/13mlw5n/data_breach_of_privacy_sparks_anxiety_and_feeling/,False,True
1634,offmychest,2022-10-11 00:41:00,mandelaXeffective,I'm so tired of being the only one fighting for relationships and I'm tired of being treated like an experiment.,"It's like every time a relationship gets even a little difficult, I'm the only one willing to actually fight for it. I'm the only one willing to do the work. I'm the only one expressing needs and setting boundaries. 

And on top of that, I'm tired of people using me. It's ok if you aren't sure about whether or not you want a relationship or you want one but aren't sure you can be in one, but that's something you should be upfront about before getting involved with someone. Some people are ok with being with someone who isn't sure like that. However, I'm not one of those people, and that's ok. Don't get involved with me if you're not sure you want a relationship, or if you're not sure you can be in one. I'm autistic and I'm demisexual and I'm disabled and I'm sick of people wasting my time, energy, and emotional labor because they can't be bothered to actually do the work.

She comes up to my window with a friend and yells obscenities at me, everything she can think of, or runs around screaming insults about me like ""UGLY WOMAN"" or ""You need more hair, baldy!"" Or homophobic stuff or whatever she can think of. She also brings her little dog with her to my window and gets it to bark, then screams help and pretends its attacking her before running away laughing. Alternatively, she screams insults at me from her window of their home. She does all of this sporadically between about 5 pm to 9 pm. I have tried to tell this girl to cut it out, but there is no stopping her. Her mom can't or won't do anything either. I don't really feel hatred toward the parent. It looks like they might be a divorced family. I only ever see her mom there. I imagine the mom might be working a lot and the girl might have issues that the mom can't tackle cause she's got her hands full. But I have no clue. I am making assumptions.

A sane neurotypical person would handle this situation appropriately. But I have autism and people don't understand that I truly am unable to speak to people IRL a lot of the time. I just can't get the words to happen. So I put up with this as if it were back pain, and I feel comforted knowing she will tire out soon. But it's still just a garbage situation to deal with every week. I believe I am targeted by this girl because she sees that I am different from other adults due to my autism. This girl has also done slightly more concerning things like ranted at me and followed me to my door as I was walking inside. I am not looking forward to when she becomes a full fledged teenager or adult. I think she might be a maniac or try to steal my things or set my house on fire. I will have to get a doorbell cam probably later on since I can't trust this kid.

1997,offmychest,2021-06-29 21:48:27,introvertedfreak21,I don't get labels,"I can understand to a degree the need for a common label, something that ties you to a community. Such as sexuality, I can understand because I'm a bisexual woman. However, I don't personally get smaller labels or one made to break a social construct. I get not everyone feels comfortable in their own skin, maybe they like don't feel true to their gender. I know for a fact that I'm not what a ""typical"" girl would be like but at the same time, when was the genders so heavily forced? Maybe its a bad perspective thing. I grew up with mainly girls and guys to play with, I liked running around outside, getting dirty and exploring nature. My female cousins enjoyed it just as much as my male cousins did. There was no real pressure placed on us to act certain ways. I get that's not the same for everyone.

My perspective may seem off to some. I just never saw any real pressure to act a certain way till I was teenager, where my step mom insisted I needed to do my hair and wear make up to get male attention. Most times, the guys I hung out with just enjoyed my humor and like for video games or for the fact that I was content to hear their issues and try to give objective advice.

I would like perspective on those who came to the conclusion they were nonbinary, it was one of the gender types that I was rather confused on. I respect that it is your choice and there is nothing wrong with that, I just want to gain better understanding.

2003,offmychest,2021-05-09 13:53:16,introvertedfreak21,Never an easy Mother's day,"I'm just posting a rant really because I don't celebrate the holiday and it can be a reminder of events leading to my mistrust of most women, even though I am a woman too.

My own mother died when I was 17 however Mother's day wasn't easy when she was around either. She was a junkie that couldn't bother getting out of beds most day, relying on her own father and strong ADHD meds to take care of her kids. I'm thankful I don't remember a lot about her because I just feel there aren't many good memories there. Even still, she was my mother and I was never truly mad at her for what happened, she had bad addiction issues and by the time I was around, she was too far gone. A part of myself will always be missing with her gone, there will be parts of myself I don't understand and will always feel unsure about.

However, I can not say the same about my dad's wife. She is more the real reason why I stopped celebrating this holiday. One mother's day, about 4 years ago(I believe this was only 2 years after my mom passed), I wasn't doing so well that mother's day. I was excited, I remembered that my step mom wanted to make a blanket out of all the cards she got and I thought it would be great if she had this giant like three foot tall mother's day card at the center of it. I had set up the display for these cards at my retail job, so I looked through all of them to find the one I thought she would like the most. I hid it in my closet for like a month waiting for Mother's day, my stepsister thought it was a good idea and my dad did too. I thought I got her a gift she would like.

The day rolls around and I have to work that evening but I got the morning to enjoy. We all got up early to help make her breakfast, ate together, everything seemed fine. The moment my dad walks outside to smoke, my step mom looks at me and says ""You should put a shirt on, no one wants to see your saggy boobs."" I was wearing a spaghetti strap tanktop because it was my pjs, even my stepsis was taken aback. We mostly ate in silence when my dad came back and I went off to my room, upset. My dad checked on me, I was so hurt because I was never very secure about my appearance but it was just so out of the blue. Dad convinced me to at least due presents and then I can stay in my room away from her. We get our gifts ready and I'm thinking maybe she will like my gift and we can move on. No, she didn't like it. She seemed upset by it because she only wanted handmade cards form my sister and I. My dad tries to move on to the gifts form him and my sis to keep her form saying something that will make me cry. I was struggling to hold back tears, it was obvious that I just wanted to go cry. They show off their gifts to her and she still isn't happy with them. They got her stuff to decorate the house with because she likes to decorate but it wasn't good enough. She then asks me why I'm about to cry and before I speak, my dad mentions how today is hard on me without my mother. That breaks me, I can't handle hearing just the reminder that she's gone and just start crying. Step mom is screaming about how today is about her, I shouldn't be crying, all that. Dad gets me to my room, screaming at her to shut up. He tells me to just avoid her by staying in my room and that he's sorry she's like this. I start calming down after a little while and texting my boyfriend only for her to come in and ""apologize"" by going on this long winded rant about her bad mother and then says ""At least your mom is gone, I wish mine was."" I couldn't believe it, I just screamed back ""At least you know yours."" My dad comes in and get step mom out, asking me what she said and just utterly appalled by her words. She tries to apologize again but at that point, I just keep telling her to leave and when she doesn't, I just yell for my dad because I don't wanna deal with this, I gotta go to work in a few hours and deal with all the people celebrating this day while I feel like shit.

They all get ready to leave, going to get their nails done as a Mother's day gift to stepmom. Dad comes in my room and tells me to try and not let this get me down at work, that he's sorry for marrying such a cruel woman and that this really made him look at her differently. He talked about divorce but I knew that wasn't gonna happen, that's a promise he whispered to me for many long years.

After that whole ordeal, I have always refused to celebrate the holiday. I'll talk to her on the day of if I see her but I never tell her happy mothers day, I never sign a card for her, none of it. She utterly shredded any chance she had at forming any kind of mother-daughter relationship with me. We have just acted like adults around one another since. I know this whole thing will hit her harder when it comes down to my eventual wedding because I will refuse to dress with her, she won't go to a bacheloette party for me. That I can all do with my stepsis, who has never been anything but family to me since I met her.

If you read this far, thank you. I've had a rough year and this day just drags out so many nasty memories for me so knowing just a few more people out there might understand this pain helps. And for those who don't, be thankful you don't. Appreciate the hell out of the mother who genuinely loved you, the stepmom who took up the role of mother for you when yours didn't. In these days, real caring mothers are a rare diamond, too many women just have kids too young and for the wrong reasons so be grateful to the mother who you know truly loves you unconditionally. I know I'll give my grandmother a call, she's one of the few women I know truly loved her children and grandchildren with all her heart.",0,2,2,1.0,0,,/r/offmychest/comments/n8envo/never_an_easy_mothers_day/,False,True

2336,offmychest,2020-10-13 15:49:38,linguisticshead,"Dear God,","I am trying to believe in you. I really want to believe in you. But there are somethings that I want to say before we further our relationship. Theoretically, you probably know all of this already, but writing some paragraphs online seems more convincing than having a dialogue inside my head with you.

I do not believe in heaven or hell. Let's be honest: the concept of living forever is just as scary as dying. The concept of living in heaven or hell makes even less sense. I know there is a mystery involving our existence. Maybe we will never really die or maybe we will never live as we are today. We cannot just be here, but I do not think none of us will ever find out.

I do not go to church. I do not like it there. It is loud and crowded. People pray so loudly and I really do not understand why. I do not like the groups, I do not like joining people and praying together, it makes me uncomfortable. I feel judged at church. I feel that if they found out that I am gay, no one would like to have me there anymore. I prefer you and I, you know? Like pals, like mates. I can talk to you and there is no judgment. I can thank you for the good things that happen in my life and I can also be angry at you if something goes terribly wrong, it is okay to be mad at you for awhile, isn't it? I am sure you understand that. I hope you understand that.

I am angry at you about my family. I really am. My mom will have it really hard when I come out. I cannot possibly imagine what my dad will do. He might hate me, he might respect it within time, but he will never come around with the fact that his only child, is a lesbian. And his only daughter wants to get some tattoos to cover up all the scars she has on her wrist from the time she was trying to deal with the discovery of her sexuality. His only daughter does not like dresses or cropped t-shirts. His only daughter prefers ties, suits and masculine clothing. It would save me so much suffering, so much sadness, so much effort if they were simply okay with who I am.

I am not angry at you because of my anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder or my autism spectrum disorder. I can deal with that. Or at least, I am trying my best – even if my best means stealing anxiety pills from my mother's cabin. You understand that, don't you? But I am really angry at you about my physical health issues that do not seem to go away even though I am in perfect shape, even though I exercise, even though I keep my diet clean. These are the things that make me angry at you. I am angry at you. I wish I were healthy. I wish I could be who I was last year. But I cannot, because these issues will not go away no matter what I do. No matter what I try. I am just 18.

I know there are many things that hurt me at the moment and maybe I will never understand why they are happening to me. But it helps to believe that you have some purpose for all of this suffering – that you know I can handle it. I do not understand you – and maybe I never will. But I want to believe in you. I want to have faith. I want to know you are always there, somehow. Help me believe in you. Help me get over the things that make it hard to believe in you.

we still have some mutual friends, and we have seen each other a lot these last couple of months for that reason. whenever we see each other now we chat and fake a conversation. I feel like we are all good. kinda like seeing an ex where the relationship did not end bad. but I just found out that she is really bitter with me, and are complaining to my friends about seeing me, and how awkward that is for her. our friends are just as confused as me seeing how normal everything seems in front of me, but then she is so mad when I am not around. but anyways my friends seem to be really annoyed with her trying to be the center of attention all while faking being super nice and innocent. and she also has a lot of other lovely qualities that made my friends realize how toxic she is. so is it wrong of me to hope that they cut her of? and what do I do about her, I know all of the stuff about her hating me through my friends, and she seems not to hide it from them.

He is emotionally closed off, almost never talks about himself, any information is few and far between, and half of it from coworkers. He is an ex-addict, and that would always worry me. He won't hang out outside of work because he's so introverted. More like impossible. He hates compliments.

I know I'm not special. His attentions shouldn't mean anything and it should be easy to drop this crush because honestly he can be kind of cringey.

BUT

He's so impossibly handsome to me. He smells amazing. He gives the. Best. Hugs. When I am stressed he really listens and gives great advice. When I'm sad he hugs me for as long as I need to feel okay. He's so forward and confident, comes off as very Dom, which is also impossibly sexy. I feel so comfortable and myself with him, touching him, or him to me. All the sassy flirty things I'm too shy to say to other guys come so naturally. He never judges me. 

We've talked about maybe being a thing one day, at least smashing it out, but that I need lots of time to heal from my last relationship. I adore his friendship too much to use him as a one night stand anyway. But how am I supposed to move on with life when I literally *dream* about this person? 

Every day I tell myself to drop it.

Every day I adore this hot mess a little more.

I'm tired of being confused. Tired of chasing his breadcrumbs of affection while acting proud like I don't even want it. Tired of feeling vulnerable. Tired of clumsily making advances that go nowhere. Tired of mixed signals. He wants me, but not to spend time with me, when he's casually fucked plenty of girls around me. 

Today I was sitting on a high stool with my legs up waiting to clock in and he came over, bent down and kind of half layed in my lap to say hi. I stroked down his head and his whole back and felt like I could do this for the rest of my life. He let's me fix his hair when it's messy and when I ask for a bite of his food he fixes me the perfect bite and feeds it to me. 

I can't do this anymore. It hurts.

I mean I kind of have a thing for ugly white women but I think with her it’s the clothes she wears,After the pandemic I went through a depression and then on the back of that I was very attracted to the wife. She wore just just basic jeans and t-shirt which I like and she got herself in good shape. I couldn’t get enough and that led to another baby. Now she dresses like a 50 year old and it’s killing me,0,0,0,0.5,0,,/r/offmychest/comments/13t3tq3/im_not_attracted_to_my_wife_i_mean_i_kind_of_have/,False,False
91,offmychest,2023-05-27 10:23:41,SadFail976,I wish either I were dead or my father were,"My (19F) father (44M) was never really around growing up and I resent him for that. Even during the times he was around, it was like he wasn’t really there. And if he was there, it would either be to physically punish me for some kind of wrongdoing or handing off his responsibilities for taking care of me to my mom. It’s as if he doesn’t want to deal with me, and nothing I do is enough to convince him otherwise. 

I never really had great memories of my father, and the good memories that I have can all be counted on a single hand. These were the only three times he actually acknowledged me for anything I did or said something as a compliment. I also resent him for being the most petty, insensitive, indifferent, insufferable, negative, emotionally unavailable person I know and the fact that I need to associate myself with him and see him now at any given part of the day makes me want to end my own life. 

My reasoning for this goes from something as simple as taking all of the sweet parts of fruits for himself, to telling me to go jump off a train platform when I’m clearly in distress and not in a good mental space, to insulting me and my appearance and invalidating my pain and suffering, to becoming physical for being too much for him to handle. I have had my panic attacks triggered by him and sent to the hospital because he would try to slap/choke me when we had an argument. Two weeks ago, we had another argument. 

I was diagnosed with a treatable type of cancer earlier year and had a few surgeries done since then and just need to go through radiation to complete my treatment. So no threat of my life being lost, but cancer is cancer and just because it’s treatable doesn’t mean I won’t be feeling like shit from the process and recovery. Two weeks ago, I was 12 days post-op  and needed to go outside to run errands but the ends of my steri-strip from the surgery were staring to curl and get caught on clothing. Before I got dressed I decided it would be a good idea to have the ends be cut off, except the incision site is somewhere that is difficult to accurately maneuver around. And I don’t want to accidentally stab myself with a pair of scissors. 

So I go to my father who is the only person who is home and available to help me, but he ends up ripping off the steri-strip instead, leaving my incision site angry and irritated for a few days. (After a previous surgery, my steri-strip was ripped off in the in my sleep and it woke me up because it was so painful so imagine how this felt) 

I told him multiple times prior to me giving him my pair of scissors to only cut off the edges only and leave the middle of the steri-strip alone, but he doesn’t heed my wishes. Much like how he doesn’t respect anything else about me either. 

I honestly don’t know why I thought it was a good idea to go to him for help in the first place. 

After I realized the steri-strip was gone and the fact that it wasn’t the scissors that were tugging on my skin but him tugging it off, I was speechless and asked him “why he would do that instead of doing what what asked”. And he replied with something along the lines of “stop making it a big deal, i did you a favor” and I stormed to my room to cry and punch the wall because I felt so violated. 

I called my mom to talk to her about what happened to calm myself down and she said she would speak with him. I hang up to go get myself ready to leave, but as I was leaving the bathroom I hear my father talking loudly on the phone with my mom complaining about me along the lines of being an ungrateful brat and other shit talk. I heard this and feel the need to defend myself, but it escalated from there and ended up with him slapping me to silence me.

We haven’t spoken since but today after a few days of radiation, he asks me if I know I need to take my laundry outside to be washed at a laundromat because he doesn’t want the household washing machine to be contaminated. I asked why and he replied saying because me and my clothes are dirty. (I have a separate laundry basket and do my laundry separately from the household but I wasn’t aware I needed to use a whole different washing machine) I honestly don’t understand whether this is coming from a place of ignorance or malice.

My father hasn’t been very supportive throughout my cancer treatment, never asked about my progress, never went with me to my appointments, never checked on me after my surgeries, etc. even said I was a liar when I got my initial diagnosis. And expects me to perform daily normal tasks that are usually easy when I am not feeling awful, when I’m feeling awful. I had a very severe bruise on my arm from an A-line post-op and was doing housework a bit slow, but he still gave me shit about it and laughed at me when pointed out I have a large bruise and didn’t want to make it worse. 

At this point, it is best if he doesn’t even step a foot near me because nothing he does helps me in the slightest bit. Seeing his face alone spoils my whole day. I feel like it would be better for me to be dead rather than needing to interact with him. I hate him, I have felt this sort of way for as long as I remember.

I found out yesterday she met someone here on reddit who shares similar interests to her. He lives a few states away and has already come to visit her. He’s 27. They started talking when my sister was 18 and this man was 27. I am shocked and upset at the fact my parents dont see an issue with this. They think because she is a legal age its okay. This guy is pretty wealthy, has a house and car, a full time adult job. My sister on the other hand is fresh out of highschool. I’m 21 and I wouldn’t even mess with an 18 year old. I worry for her and idk what to do. I fear she’ll run away to go live with him (which she has every reason to tbh our dad is a terror). But this guy has so much power over her. Financially and age wise. From my experience you are in a totally different mindset between the ages of just 19 and 21… let alone 27! Wtf does he want to do with a 19 year old!!",0,2,2,1.0,0,,/r/offmychest/comments/13t3lro/freaking_out_because_my_sister_is_dating_a_grown/,False,False
