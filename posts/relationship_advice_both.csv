466,relationship_advice,2022-07-11 10:23:37,SpicyRamen5193,How do I encourage my Boyfriend to clean more?,"I've (19F) been living with my boyfriend (22M) for 4/5 months (Together for 10/11 months) now and the place became messy for a little bit until I dug myself out of a rut and cleaned up. He's helped me clean a good number of times but doesn't really clean by himself very often. He had an abusive childhood where his father would beat and yell at him if he didn't clean the house everyday so I understand why he hates cleaning. I want to help him set habits for the future and have talked about this with him and have tried to come up with ideas to help his motivation to clean like a reward system, but he's said he's not interested in that idea as it feels demeaning to him. Any ideas?

Edit: He is fine to clean on his own when asked to do a specific task and doesn't complain and we've made some ground rules like he'll wash the dishes when I cook and dump his soda cans. He just has trouble cleaning on autopilot is all.

TLDR: I need ideas to help motivate my boyfriend to clean on his own.",1,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/vwf29p/how_do_i_encourage_my_boyfriend_to_clean_more/,False,True

2002,relationship_advice,2021-05-11 19:49:24,introvertedfreak21,"Boyfriend totaled my car, moves in, and now might buy a motorcycle","I'm not sure how to feel on all of this so I'll give some backstory first

My boyfriend and I have been together 4 years now, we knew each other for 5 years before dating so he is someone I know very well and trust deeply.

Last August, I saved up $1,500 to use as a down payment on a 2015 Toyota Camry, I loved that car so much. It was the first I ever had a nice car. My only other car was a 2003 Ford Ranger that needed a lot of love so I was excited to get a car that I didn't have to worry about so much about having issues.

Anyways, two weeks ago, my boyfriend and I were heading home from work. We stopped at the nearby Walmart. It was dark out, we were waiting at a stop bar to turn left into coming traffic. He was driving at the time and I was the passenger. Lanes looked cleared, saw no one coming and then, out of nowhere, the airbags deployed. This woman came up on a hill and hit the front of my car. Her airbags didn't deploy for some reason. The accident details aren't that necessary to the story, just the cops deemed it my boyfriend's fault. I had full coverage so my insurance just paid the loan off on that car and I'm out the already $2k I put into the car.

Now, to today. For a good week, we were looking into buying me another car but like one someone is selling. My boyfriend offered me the $2k he saved up to help me since I had to miss a lot of work this last month because of an eye injury. He moved in to my place with my roommate so rent is cheaper, I pay nothing on car insurance, and my boyfriend does let me use his car(04 Volvo V7 with over 230k miles on it). Problem is that today, I told him I wanted some time to myself, to process my emotions on everything and just relax. So, he decided to go take a look at motorcycles for fun, he loves them. The issue starts there. He is debating on getting one and I'm feeling crossed at the moment. He said he would give me his car as long as I want till I save up money to get my own car. Ever since the accident, I've just felt hollow. I come from a very controlling family, I had to fight so hard for every inch of freedom I could get. They charged me so much in rent that saving up money was hard, I had to move out with the help of my roommate's dad. So, being able to save up money to get the car I wanted and to have lost it, it hurt. I don't know how to feel now. I'm jealous my boyfriend might get a bike, something he's wanted for so long after he totaled a car I worked so hard to get. He did offer to still use the $2k he had to help me get another car, I'm still looking at used cars but the waiting game is so hard and I'm just so drained these days. It also doesn't help that the doctor I've been seeing about my eye(the injury is still healing but I'm cleared to work) wants me off one of the three days I work(3 days, 12hr days) and I can't work my side job yet because they didn't send a piece of this welcome kit(its a delivery service). So, I'm just feeling so lost.

Edit: The $2k I mentioned is not my money, its still his and if I find a car for that cost, he will pay it and I will pay it back to him over time. Its more so just a loan form him.",13,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/na5wfo/boyfriend_totaled_my_car_moves_in_and_now_might/,False,True

My mother and I never found this too rude or anything, just quirky because we know that he, being autistic, gets overwhelmed easily and we understand that he feels comfortable enough with us that he can fall asleep.

But now that I'm working full time and he's supposed to be in charge of just taking care of the house, I'm feeling strangely jealous and abandoned because I only have so much time that isn't spent at work.

He says he stayed up until 4am because he just didn't get tired until then, which I get but I also feel like I shouldn't have to miss out on family time because of his decision.

I love him and understand why he does things I just struggle to explain to him how his behaviour makes me feel. I have PTSD and have been struggling with my mental health so I just find it so hard to keep perspective. Especially when it comes to expecting him to be present.

2678,relationship_advice,2019-11-03 03:03:22,frogsrock_freddy,"Paper marriage abroad, should my (F24) fiance’s (M25) family attend?","My fiancé and I have been together for about 8 years, and we moved to Tokyo for his job about three months ago. We’re both US citizens but my fiancé is also a Japanese citizen - I haven’t been lucky enough to find a job to sponsor my visa here, so we’ve decided to get married so I can stay on the spousal visa until we return to the US later next year.

My parents who both live in the US decided they absolutely need to attend our marriage license appointment at the govt office here in Tokyo. We’re planning on having a “real” marriage with family/friends in winter of next year when his job transfers us back to the US. However, as I’m an only child and my parents are pretty old they’ve decided they just can’t miss out on this little milestone of the paper wedding.

Issue is, I think we’re making my fiance’s mother feel obligated to travel here as well for the marriage paperwork. She previously expressed that she really doesn’t care about this part of the process - but now that she hears that my parents will be flying out, she feels like someone from their family is “obligated” to show up as well. 

My fiance’s parents and younger siblings all live in the US, and although the father is verrry distant I know his mom has worked a bit harder at staying close. Fiancé repeatedly says he doesn’t need anyone from his family to show up for the paper wedding as it’s just a formality for my visa. 

How can I let future MIL know she’s not required to fly out here for the marriage paperwork appt? Or, am I reading the situation wrong and it would be a good idea to have her attend? There’s a bit of a language barrier but we can generally communicate. I really don’t want to make them spend money on the flight if they’re just feeling pressure to match my parents’ strangely high level of enthusiasm for paperwork.",2,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/dqux96/paper_marriage_abroad_should_my_f24_fiances_m25/,False,True

Not exclusively. He told me I love you within 3 weeks. He used to tell me he wants to have my my kids and travel together etc. All sweet things. He cooked for me and actually pressured me to stay at his initially to sleep over. He kept telling people I'm his GF even tho I clarified I was waiting on an official date nd it felt too fast. He was always upset if I didn't reply on time nd when I took a holiday he was suspicious of my friend cause he didn't get to speak to her. But we were talking only 3 weeks at the time..

Things felt quick but I said I'd try since he seemed sweet and making effort . We started having arguments recently . He didn't like how I'd be upset when he'd do something. When we argued he had called me all forms of names and apologised and I accepted.  About 3 days later we argued again because he was angry that I picked a call while we were talking (urgent 1 ) and y didn't I tell him straight away on the phone. He hung up on me about 5 times. Told me to go do whatever secretive thing I need to do.

Next day I was upset and told him he was rude and he said sorry for yesterday.  I told him am upset cause not long so he was also shouting at me and telling me to shut up and called me liar (over small misunderstanding)then again shouting and name calling.

Now he's claimed he's miserable. I am to blame for everything. I'd stab him if I could because I'm still upset after his apology..  He doesn't want to ever talk to me and he'll never ring me . That he feels I'm abusive He did say he doesn't know why he's shouting at me and doesn't recognise himself when I told him he's unfair.

How can we get over this road blocks together?,"We’ve been dating for 2 1/2 years and when times are good, they’re amazing and when times are bad, they’re really bad. She’s very insecure so I used to keep things from her because if she found out she would be mad. she found out anyways, and obviously was very mad, an example of this is she did not like me having female friends and texting them so I would hide the amount I texted them (it was only a few times a week, but she felt like I was prioritizing them over her). 

Nevertheless, it’s been a long time since her and I have had these arguments, and I am becoming more open and honest with her. 

All of a sudden she has brought up that she still doesn’t forgive me for this, even though I tell her that I am actively working on getting her trust back, and just being an overall better boyfriend.

185,relationship_advice,2023-05-27 10:45:48,ThrowRa-Trifle-9382,I (22f) am in a relationship (22m) and don't feel loved anymore,"So me (22f) and my boyfriend (22m) are together again for almost a half year now. I say again because 3 years ago were also in a relationship. I broke it of at that time because he was a huge smoker en lied to me all the time. Now i have to admit I really missed him in those 2 years and when he contacted me I was willing to try again.

Now the issue ain't with the lying anymore. He has been brutal honest since we started dating again and I appreciate that. It's the fact I think he stopped trying to do his best for this relations because. I think the reason is because we already dated once he doesn't have to ""court"" me or something and just takes me for granted.

Some examples: everytime he is coming to my place he is always late or there is something more important to do then comming over. I am talking 3-4 hours later, every single time. Whenever he promise to do something it is not happening. If he promise to call te next day, he won't. If he says he has a suprise for me, he got nothing. In the beginning he would message me goodmorning and goodnight and we would talk through app all the time and call me a lot about things, but after a few weeks I get almost no text and he only calls me late at night after his work.

When I confront him about it he calls me crazy. He says I never talk about my problems with him. But when I do, he just sight and says he can't deal with this right now and I just have to give it a place on my own. 

Last week I was done. I coulnt handle crying myself to sleep every single night. I called him up and said I didn't wanted to do this anymore and I wanted to break up. He got defensive and said that we can talk about these problems right after he got back from a camping/ small music festival. He needed some time for himself to think and I understands that, because it was already a planned trip for him to be alone with his thoughts. He also said we will talk when he get back and he will try to change. So i agreed.

Now the night before he was about the leave I called him up. Only to find out he is not going to this music festival alone like he planned to, to be alone with his thoughts. He is going with his usual group of music festival friends. In about three weeks he will go again to a bigger music festival with these group. He lied to me saying he is going there to get some rest and peace and even cancelled going to Paris with me to do so. All for something that he will do again in 3 weeks.

I am devestated. I coulnt talk with him about this because when I tried talking about it the night before he was tired and said i need to deal with this on my own until I get back. Now I don't want to have this conversation and ruin his days there (even tho this happened). But I feel broken. I will be leaving to Paris on my own tommorow so I dont know when I have a change to talk. I don't know if I can handle talking to him, because I know he will not listen, blame everything on me and just let me deal with it alone.

I do love this man. I really do. I wished we could have a future together. But if he never shows me love, if he always puts me on last place I dont think I can handle that.

189,relationship_advice,2023-05-27 10:26:12,Glittering_Abalone50,My boyfriend (M25) said I (F23) cause his depression,"On new years I asked my boyfriend of 3 years how he looked back on the passed year, and he out of nowhere said it was a very difficult and terrible year for him. He could sometimes look stressed and then I would ask him what’s wrong and comfort him. To me it just seemed like a normal stressful day or week. But apparently what he told me then wasn’t all that was on his mind. I’m always there for him and have never given him a reason not to trust me, why didn’t he let me help him? He told me that when the time is right he would tell me, so I waited.

Fast forward almost 5 months later. He would often turn cold and be really rude to me. If I asked him he was ok he would say I am asking him too many questions, not to worry and to leave him alone. I was walking on eggshells. Last week I talked to him about this and that it’s very difficult for me to understand his cold behaviour without knowing the reason why. He then told me “you wanna know the reason for my depression? It’s you”. I only replied saying “oh, ok. That’s not what I expected.” I tried my hardest not to show emotions cause he would then maybe say “see?? That’s why I didn’t want to tell you”. So I just took it and eventually we came to a solution (i have to change). 

He said I caused his depression by being disrespectful. I started uni again in September to work on my future and have made some new friends (mostly guys, I major IT-security there are only like 3 girls in the whole year). Also I’ve been into going to raves sometimes. On average I go to one every 2 months, tell him with who, send pictures and he has my location 24/7. He also knows my phone password and told him he can see my phone whenever he wants. 

Also apparently I ask too many questions (he doesn’t want me to ask how his work was when he comes home, how his meeting went etc). And I’m rude. He is Japanese and the way I talk and my opinions are sometimes too much for him. I can say in my friend group I’m known for being calm. 

I’m just really hurt I can say I always do my best for him and hearing that you’re causing the person you love depression is not really nice. Also my mom passed away this april and handling both these things is a lot. I have no energy left over I’m exhausted. 

My boyfriend can be so kind, funny and he helped me through so many things. We’ve been living together for more than 2 years now and it’s the first time I’ve really felt like I have a home. I love him but I don’t like this side of him. He can sometimes completely flip his personality and it’s scary, like laughing at me in my face while I share feelings saying “why you always crying”.

I just want to try to fix this if I can. Losing him might be more than I can handle. We’ve been dating about 1 1/2 years.

So to start, about a month ago, I made a horrible mistake. I got way too drunk at a house party, and was convinced by girl friends of mine to kiss a few of them. I don’t remember doing it, but I’ve been told it was 2-3. I would have never done this sober. I’m straight, no doubt about it. Immediately after I did it, I told my boyfriend and started apologizing. I felt horrible, especially because some of those friends told him he should just forgive me and let it go, “because I was exploring my sexuality.” I wasn’t. I know I’m not interested in women. I’m just a shitty girlfriend who doesn’t control her impulses when drunk.
The next day, when we were both sober, we talked. He said he forgave me, and asked that I lessen my contact with those friends, which I did. I still felt guilty, and continued to apologize, but he said it was okay. Things were off since then, but I thought it was stress from graduating and starting work.
Tonight, he called me while drinking with his friends and said he really was having a hard time forgiving me. We talked and are going to talk more tomorrow, but he said he loves me but what I did just hurt him a lot. Which is reasonable. What I did was unforgivable and I don’t deserve his love or his forgiveness. But I desperately want to make things right and to start healing. I have no idea what to do or how to start it. I absolutely hate myself for what I did. It breaks my heart I hurt him. I just don’t know what to do.

After she planned to go out with her friends (girls night) I planned to to something with my friends that day.

However her friends canceled on her and she now wants to stay home with me instead. However I don't want to cancel on my friends (she knew about my plans) 

I think it is just an AH move to cancel with my friends, besides I actually was looking forward to meet them again.

I just think it is common sense not to cancel without a very good reason, once one commits. And I know my friends would not do the same to me.

193,relationship_advice,2023-05-27 10:13:54,No-Matter5594,Libido mismatch with my (22F) boyfriend (24M). What to do about it?,"I have no idea what to start from, but I really need outside perspective on the current sexual dynamic I have with my boyfriend. The situation is very complex and it’s hard for me to tell every single thing that I think contributed to where we arrived now, so if something is confusing please don’t hesitate to ask a question.  
Important information before reading: We’re in our 20’s, we started living together a few months ago and were long distance for 2 years before that (different countries)  
To put the problem simply at first: Me and my boyfriend have very different libido. This generally applies to our sex life, but specifically to penetrative sex. I, as of now, have pretty much no need to have penetrative sex, contrary to my boyfriend.  
There are several things that are affecting my situation: From the beginning, penetrative sex was painful for me. My boyfriend did not rush me to have sex (I was a virgin when we met), we really took our time and he cared about my pleasure a lot, we bought dilators etc. so I could be as comfortable as possible. What’s very important to mention was that we were both interested in more kinky sex, he had experience with it but I only had fantasies about it. My perspective now (this is not how I felt back then) is that I did not have a good enough understanding what sex like that makes you feel like in real life and how to deal with it - this intensity was fun to watch or talk about, but in real life causing me slight pain/talking to me in a degrading way was different. Wanting him to be satisfied and seeing him happy and into it in my head was more important to me than thinking if this is actually pleasurable for me. At the time, there was still an adrenaline rush to it, he always asked me for consent (which I gave) and we talked about what we were doing. In general, I would say I have a lot of regrets about that time and I’ve talked about it, but I do not think he ever actually understood how this impacted me.  
While we were still doing kinky things and having more rough sex, he has done something I have specifically asked him not to do before because it made me feel bad - he put his hand on my throat and slightly squeezed. When he did I kind of zoned out (not because it was strong just out of shock I suppose) so we continued for a bit longer, then I stopped it and he said that he “was so close to cumming” (We both don’t cum from penetrative sex but that’s a different story). I talked with him how that was not ok and he apologised and I brought up that situation several times since then when we talked about our libido mismatch. This was basically the moment when I stopped wanting to have any kinky sex and every time we had missionary sex since then (like that time), I cry. It usually happens as soon as I see him “get into it” the way he did at that moment. It just makes me feel very depersonified, like I am not a person he loves, but a thing to fuck.  
Now, we’re in a situation where we try to have penetrative sex once a month and usually it ends quite quickly with my crying or being just about to do it. He comforts me, he hugs me, he is there for me when it happens. I have incredible guilt built up inside of me anytime we have a conversation about us not having sex anymore that I am not satisfying him. I have no idea what to do - I would love to go to a sex therapist, but we are both very poor and there is literally no disposable income we have besides the one for groceries and rent. I love this man incredibly and I know I want to fix it and he feels the same, but it feels like there is nothing I can do about these things. I feel like for both of us it’s this gruelling feeling that we cannot do anything about this anymore even though we want to and we love each other. It just feels some stupid to end a relationship when there is still so much love left and you grew together so beautifully over one thing (significantly, but nevertheless one) not working well.  
I don’t know… I am thankful to anyone that made it this far. Did any of you have similar stories - something you partner did put you over the edge and you just could not do kinky stuff anymore? Is there any way out of this where both parties are happy? Besides this, I would love to hear from any women who have vaginismus etc. on how they manage to have sex regularly and pleasurably. Thank you so much for any advice!  
TLDR: My boyfriend has way higher libido than me and is more interest in kinky sex. My interest in it faded due to a few situations between us and due to the pain I experience at the beginning of sex. Is there any way to save this?",2,2,2,1.0,0,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/13t3n4r/libido_mismatch_with_my_22f_boyfriend_24m_what_to/,True,False
194,relationship_advice,2023-05-27 10:13:30,throwrapyjamahead,I 36m suspect my brotherinlaw 48m of poisoning his son 18m,"About 13 years ago I had a conversation with my brother in law in which he unexpectedly brought up that he poisons his child whenever the child gets on his nerves and that he would never give him too much to kill the child as he isn't a monster.  He stated the poison was tasteless and odourless and small doses were undetectable in blood tests.  He then backtracked and said he was joking and would never do that.
I discussed this with my partner at the time who said he had mentioned trying to design rodent traps.
My sisters child has had stomach issues all his life.  I mentioned this to my sister and suggested a urine test should confirm if the poison was or was not present.
My sister then had an argument with her husband in which he denied poisoning the child.
The child has just turned 18 and still has stomach issues and displays symptoms that could be related to mild poisoning.  The stomach issues have caused him to pull out of school and remain undiagnosed although multiple tests have been ran.
I don't want to ruin my relationship with my sister who has been a huge support to me in life.
My brother in law is a manipulator and schemer which has led him to be wealthy, and my sister admits at times she wonders if difficult situations he places her in are deliberate and he doesn't have a great relationship with her or the kids.
How do I suggest a simple urine test could remove all suspicion or confirm my fears?",4,7,7,0.82,0,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/13t3mwy/i_36m_suspect_my_brotherinlaw_48m_of_poisoning/,False,False
195,relationship_advice,2023-05-27 10:11:57,throwRA-91919,My (28m) ex girlfriend (26f) is furious that I lied to her about my real income and benefits during our relationship. Did I do the right thing?,"English is not my first language and I apologise for any grammar mistake. I (28m) am legally blind with some remaining vision left. From what I can best describe my vision is looking through clouds. i make six figures from rental properties, investment and disability benefits. I also have a connection with a premium airline that allow me to havve significant discount on any flight and accommodation. Anyways, I met my ex girlffriend (26f), let's call her Jen, through a mutual friend and I found her to be very sweet and caring. Our friendship grew closer and we starter dating. She knew I was legally blind and I asked her if she was sure as I might be too reliant on her. She took her time and said yes. Due to my past relationships where I was being taken advantage of, I decided not to disclose my real income and flight benefits. I only told her my income was around $50k and that i own one rental property. Our relationship was great and i made sure not to be reliant on her but she insisted on helping me whenever I struggled with navigating around places and ordering food. To reward her for being a great partner, I bought her luxury gifts and overseas trips together. She was very happy which also made me happy. However, after six months of dating, she suddenly told me she realised she wanted to have an independent partner and did not want to be seen as someone who is dating a blind person so she broke up with me. I was heartbroken but I understood. Fast forward to four months later, I invited four close friends of mine on a trip to Japan as a way to move on and spend quality time with friends. All flights and accommodation were paid by me. The trip happened last week and we had a good time. My friends were very accommodating to me and grateful for my generosity. Jen  found out about the trip from IG story posted by one of my close friends. She asked my friend about it and they told her that I paid for the whole trip and that's where she found out that I have flight benefits and I make more than I originally told her. She called me to confront me about it saying if I told her the truth she would have stayed with me. I explained to her that i have been taken advantage of in the past and that I did not want to be treated the same again. She was angry and said she is not that kind of person and that I will never find a partner ever then hung up. My friends said she is clearly a gold digger. I forgave my friend who told Jen because they thought she knew. I question myself whether or not keeping my high income and flight benefits secret was the right thing to do and if i should be honest about it in any future potential relationship. A part of me tells me she is only angry that I lied to her in the whole relationship. It is hard to be in a relationship as a blind person and I rather spend time with quality friends.",6,4,4,1.0,0,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/13t3m0l/my_28m_ex_girlfriend_26f_is_furious_that_i_lied/,False,False
