1938,1939,yes,mildlyinfuriating,2023-03-31 14:02:34,emdelgrosso,‚ÄúI‚Äôll pay you more than anyone ever has for your time.‚Äù,"I (24F) have a relative that runs their own business. 

They needed help putting together a spreadsheet to track their profit and loss, but the specifics of this spreadsheet were quite expansive. 

They knew I had the capability to help, as well as the time, so they explained what they needed and said they‚Äôd pay me ‚Äúmore than anyone ever has for my time.‚Äù

I‚Äôve been paid up to $35 an hour for my time (which they knew), so I thought this would be a sweet gig. 

I spent about 15 hours, enrolled the help of my brother on a few small formulas I couldn‚Äôt figure out, knowing I‚Äôd have a big check headed my way and would absolutely cut him in on it, and then scheduled a meeting to work through the sheet with the family member. 

We met, I showed them the inner workings, the beautiful visuals, the summary sheets, etc. and when it was time to leave, I was handed a crisp $100. 

I thought it was a joke at first, but it most certainly was not. 

Which worked out to less than $6 an hour if I include my brother‚Äôs time. 

I realized then and now that it‚Äôs on me for not getting a number out of my family member. But the promise of ‚Äúmore than anyone has ever paid me for my time‚Äù sure did sound like more than minimum wage. 

And yes, they did know how long it took me to build the sheet.

ETA- I will have to see this person at family functions for all of eternity, so all of the chastising for not being more firm or rude in this situation isn‚Äôt very helpful lol.",106,62,62,0.75,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='127mgqt')>,,/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/127mgqt/ill_pay_you_more_than_anyone_ever_has_for_your/,,,False,True
