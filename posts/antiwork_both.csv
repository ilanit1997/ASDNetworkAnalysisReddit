905,antiwork,2022-01-13 19:55:46,cyborgmonkey-,Mandatory number of interviews.,"The state I worked for had mandatory minimum interviewees. I think it was three. So even when they know who they want to hire they have to bring in three candidates.


I know this is intended to promote fairness but it only makes everything worse. While my daughter was young and I was eager to secure stable employment I worked in an agency as a temporary employee. I very much wanted permanent status, and so I drove to interviews as far as 7 hours away. I got told 5 separate times that they would have hired me….. if they hadn’t planned on someone else. Once I called ahead and asked the manager ahead of time if this was the case. Thankfully she told me the truth and saved me a heavy rush hour drive. That could have been time number six.


In another agency I saw it multiple times when promoting, or rehiring an old hire.  I’ve no doubt most people are familiar with this if not having seen it personally, but there is an unseen cost to the taxpayers in this case, and it is huge. Panels also must have three people on them, usually two managers and a senior. Then it takes them multiple days to interview, and multiple days to decide. That’s three totally wasted salaries for at least 3 days and sometimes far more. So if the manager makes 30 an hour and other two make 15, which I think is generous, and you include the money that employers pay towards workman comp and unemployment, etc… Which can run up to 50% from my memory in staffing but I don’t know exactly now, so we’ll say 25% to be generous. That ends up $60 plus 25%, or $75 per hour!!! Three people, three working days of eight hours each and you have that times 24, or $1800 for an interview where they have no intent on considering anyone else.


That’s just the state cost though. Then there are the employees being rejected needlessly to satisfy their quotas. Those people spend time and money going to interviews, they get their hopes up, and then they get them dashed over and over. That bears a psychological burden and a complete mistrust of the employer.",0,2,2,1.0,0,,/r/antiwork/comments/s382nh/mandatory_number_of_interviews/,False,True

Instead of letting me know directly, she emails me with an unofficial reprimand for forgetting (with a passive aggressive statement about how this person has been with us for 6 months- I know I’ve been emailing them for 6months!) and cc’s our program director.

I sat through a meeting yesterday about how we’re being forced to come back to the office every day starting next week. And our executive director couldn’t even be bothered to stay for the entire meeting after dropping that bomb on us….but we got shitty pizza! 

And the really upsetting part is that he didn’t even actually say we had to come back. He sort of implied it . Which meant that no one questioned it at the time because we didn’t understand what he was telling us at first. 

And later everyone was like ’do they think we’re stupid? Music and pizza are not making up for this.’

I’m really trying not to fall apart. I won’t see my husband or my baby most of the time. I hate it here.  🤬

For example, a customer will ask ""do you have any more of x product?"" and the coworker will say ""I don't have any more"" vs ""we don't have any more""","I feel like this will trigger some of you because I'm sure people in this sub use ""I"" statements at work.

I have an awful bossy coworker and I heard a customer ask if we had any more of a certain product in the back. This awful coworker replies, ""I don't have any more in stock""

I know it's a very simple statement but it reveals a LOT. Any coworker I've had say this kind of comment (vs. Just saying 'we') has been fucking awful. They think they own the store and their coworkers. They are usually suck-ups to bosses and will rat you out for anything. And most importantly, people like this are incredibly difficult to work with. They're always on a power trip.

I have another example. My GM called the cops on a guy panhandling outside the store. When he was describing it to me, he said ""I don't want him doing that outside MY store"". Bro. It's not your store, it belongs to a corporation. You are just as replaceable as I am... if anything, its OUR or THE store....not ""MINE""....and you guessed it, he fucking sucks. 

Hopefully I'm describing this well. Have you worked with someone that uses ""I"" statements like I described? If so, how was that coworker?

ETA: more examples someone like this would say:

Customer: ""when do you get mums back in stock?""
Coworker: ""I will get more on the 20th""

Customer: ""why are all the mums wilted?""
Coworker: ""my mums got frozen on the truck""

Customer: ""can I return this after 30 days?""
Coworker: ""my return policy is before 30 days ""

Customer: ""do you have more potatoes?""
Coworker: ""my potatoes are all out right now""

I have worked here for 8 months and it's been the worst job I've ever had (and stayed at). The managers are the rudest I've ever come across. They cut hours. Purposely don't give you two days off in a row as punishment. Favoritism. Soooo much more

I've hated this place since the first day I started. My issue is....I literally am unable to look for new jobs. Idk what is wrong with me but this place has sucked all of my energy and I can't bring myself to look/apply.

I've tried looking for new jobs. And I just can never do it. So I was thinking....I need to fucking quit my current job with nothing lined up after. If I quit, it'll light a fire under my ass to get a new job and I'll actually follow through

I'm realizing that I'm stagnating my life. And part of that is because of this job. How long am I going to delay the next chapter of my life? I feel like I just need to quit now so I can finally move on!

My main concern is that once I quit, I won't be able to find a better job. What if I don't get motivated to apply after quitting. What am I going tell my next employer about why I quit this current job?

Idk. I know quitting without anything lined up for after is bad but I feel like I need to just finally quit so I can move on with my life.

Has anyone ever been in a similar place? Anything that helped you to apply to jobs while currently working at an awful one? I need encouragement to quit! Everyone tells me ""don't quit until you have something lined up for after"" but I can't bring myself to line anything up!! I really just wanna gtfoh and I need people to encourage me to do so 😕

Thank God I knew this is something he says to people otherwise that would've fucked me up bad... but that gives you an idea of how toxic this place is.  They accuse of you doing things you literally didn't do..... and for what? No one knows

The things he said made no sense and he never watches me work. So I started to think, this evil coworker is probably saying things to him. She has gotten 2 other coworkers out of our department already and they weren't even bad, they were good workers.

My GM said to bring him a ""decision"" (idk what that means) by Friday. I didn't think of this until now but I would so much rather switch stores. 

How do I go about asking? My GM clearly wants me to stay since he wants me to switch departments... I don't understand why he doesn't just fire me, the talk we had was so weird. 

Do I mention this coworker? I'm thinking not. I was just thinking of saying ""would you be willing to transfer me to a different store?

76,antiwork,2023-05-27 08:47:32,vburnin8tor,Written up & Verbally Reprimanded for clocking in on time.,"I work at a skating rink, and the “expectation” is to clock in once you have your skates on. See, the problem is that there is 0 ‘early’ or ‘late’ leniency meaning if you miss your clock in time you’re late.

(Safe to assume the crowding and stress around the clock in location @ clock-in time)

I learned this fact on my second day, because I tried to be a “diligent worker” & arrive and wrongly assume I could 15 minutes early. Ever since that day, I’ve been clocking in as soon as I step foot in the building with no skates on. (Additionally there is a clock in station immediately beside the employee entrance but I’m forced to use the one in the office because “You’re not allowed”)

So, as evidenced by my 99% on time accuracy stat on Homebase; I enter the building at 7:13, and make the trek to the office to clock in.

Multiple Admin attempted to stop me: getting in my way, whistling at me, & demanding I go put my skates on.
I ignore them, headed straight to the clock in station, and Damn, it’s still 7:14. I need manager pin approval in order to clock in. I stand there for less than 30 seconds, and all 3 on duty admins walk into the office.

“Hey you can’t do that, you need to have your skates on”

Okay, I’m clocked in I’ll go put them on now.

“No we mean you need to have them on before you clock in”

There is no leniency on this machine so I won’t have enough time to lace up my boots and then come back to clock. Unless you’d like me to enter the building with my skates on.

“Why are you making this difficult? You clock in once you’re ready to work, which is with your skates on.”

I’m ready to work as soon as the door shuts behind me, and because I’m restricted from being here early, I have no reason to be here early, therefore I will clock in as soon as I enter the building.

“You can’t do that. You need to be here before then to lace up your boots & be ready.”

If you need me here earlier than 7:15 for any reason, I’d like my clock in time adjusted. Like I’ve said already I’m ready to work and provide value to you once I’m in here. Hell, I’m in the parking lot for 10 minutes or more on a typical day and I don’t get in trouble out there.

“We won’t be adjusting clock in times just for you, but you will be getting ‘written up’”

Okay, I understand I’ll be written up for being here on time.

I initially applied for an Information Technology position at a local health clinic locally, within a couple days I had an email stating that I would like to be met with for an interview. I kindly responded to the email with something along the lines of “Absolutely, what available times do you have?” The IT manager says that he has an appointment for Friday (May 19, 2023) and for Thursday (May 25, 2023) I am a father of 3 with an infant that is barely a month old. I had other obligations to attend on the 19th, so I told the manager that I am available anytime on the 25th. The next day, (May 19, 2023), I got an email from the same manager asking if I could meet him at 10 A.M. that same day. Not a super big deal, I just thought it was kind of weird that he would ask me to come in that day when I had already specified that I had other things to attend. He reassures me that Thursday the 25th would be fine still. I show up to the clinic 15 minutes early (just to ensure that I could find where I needed to go) I talk to the front desk receptionist like the IT manager instructed me to and to ask for (let’s call him Bob). I ask for Bob and they call him and according to the receptionist he totally forgot that he even scheduled me for an interview. He tells the receptionist that he will be there as soon as he possibly can (no ETA)  I was recently laid off from my previous IT job and I have 3 children of my own so I really need the money. So I waited in the lobby in hopes that he would be there in a couple minutes  to get this interview underway. 30-35 minutes later he shows up ready for the interview. I follow him to the conference room that they have in their basement, as soon as we sit down in the chairs, he folds his legs and hops on his phone instantly and stays on it for a solid 15 minutes. (The interview was only 20 minutes long) he asks me several questions about my relevant experience in the field (pretty standard questions) but he did not seem to be listening to what I was saying and would interrupt my sentences with another question. About 10 minutes into the interview, we hear a knock on the conference door, another IT coworker of his says that another person is here to interview. (Apparently he had forgotten about this person too) this gentleman came prepared in a nice suit and ready for his interview. Bob tells the coworker that he needs to come back on Monday for the interview. I feel bad for this poor guy, I know I would have been pissed if I were him. He politely says that he will be back Monday. After he finally gets off of his phone, he looks at me and says, “I didn’t really have time to look at your resume, what are your salary expectations”. I’m not a recruiter or a manager by all means, but isn’t the point of a resume to see your candidates on paper before an interview? Anyways, I explain to him that my salary expectations are around 50k / year. (That was what I was making at my previous job) and that I was willing to go a bit lower if the position starts around that range. He tells me that the position starts off at $15 per hour, and that I could try to talk to HR about possibly getting that starting wage higher. But wouldn’t really count on it. 

I don’t see myself working here anytime soon just because of the wages alone. But I also feel like Bob was completely unprofessional about the entire interview process as a whole. What do you guys think? Am I being a Karen? I don’t want anyone else to have to go through this shitty experience like I have. I’m 26 years old and haven’t had a ton of interviews, but this experience was completely different than any other I have had.",4,1,1,0.67,0,,/r/antiwork/comments/13t1gud/was_this_interview_unprofessional_or_is_it_just_me/,False,False
