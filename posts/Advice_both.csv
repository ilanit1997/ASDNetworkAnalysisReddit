1175,Advice,2022-12-31 03:19:23,emdelgrosso,How do I handle my invasive neighbor?,"Context: 
My husband (M25) and I (F24) (no kids) moved into our first home in April 2022. (Southern USA)

The couple that lives on one side of us (“our neighbors”) is older and retired, has lived here for 2x longer than I’ve been alive, have 2 grown kids that have each moved to opposite sides of the country that they don’t see often, and they don’t have any commitments/hobbies other than the husband painting as far as I know. All this to say they have a lot of time and probably less social interaction than they need. 

Situation:
Our neighbors started out very kind, albeit with a much more intense level of involvement with us and our goings on than I had ever seen or experienced but know sometimes people have “nosy neighbors.” But I knew they were kind and well intentioned.

A little bit ago, my husband bumped into them out and about and ended up casually mentioning that I had a medical test coming up. This happening has ended up creating the most overwhelming, frustrating, taxing interpersonal situation I have dealt with in my entire adult life. I know that sounds dramatic. Keep reading.

Since that first test, unfortunately for me, the doctors have found more and more concerning things and have assigned me more and more tests. I have had at least one upcoming test at all times for months at this point, always being promised answers if we just do one more scan/test/procedure. Every single time one of these appointments is approaching, I get a text message from my neighbors telling me I’m being prayed for and asking if I need anything. Every single time one of these appointments pass, I get a call asking me how they’ve gone. 

This has been well intentioned of course, but feels invasive and adds to my overwhelm. 
But I’ve navigated it. Until today. 

I texted her today to let her know how today’s test went so that she didn’t blind-side me while I am in public tomorrow (and so that I could control the timeline, knowing she is going to ask me soon regardless). 
She calls. I let it go to voicemail (my throat hurts from my test today, talking makes it worse, and I am fully out of socializing today) and she texts me asking to call her when I can. I let her know I’m in pain and emotional and will call if I feel up to it and appreciate her caring. 

THEN! My doorbell rings. I’ve been recovering all day. I feel awful. I have been crying all day. I don’t want to socialize. It’s 9 p.m. 

I send my husband to go send her away. She insists she “just wants to hug, doesn’t have to talk.” He knows the shit storm he’d be in for if he made me talk to her, so he kindly said he’d pass on hugs and got her to leave, and then…

SHE. CALLS. MY. FATHER. 

Who I do not live with! 
She doesn’t know my dad knows anything about my medical things. 

This is so far beyond and past anything I am okay with. I feel totally violated. I feel frustrated. I should not have to carry this emotional burden of handling this. 

I can’t handle this the way I feel inclined to because I have to live next to them for an indeterminate amount of time. 

What do I do? What do I say? How do I handle this? Please give me any ideas at all. I’m at my wits end. 

I just want a friendly wave when we see each other outside. The occasional request to keep an eye out when either of us are out of town. A normal neighbor relationship. I’ve never done anything to allude I want anything more.",41,5,5,0.73,0,,/r/Advice/comments/zzjz8x/how_do_i_handle_my_invasive_neighbor/,False,True
1890,Advice,2021-01-19 10:06:47,bwssoldya,Struggling with selfishness versus being there for others,"Hey r/Advice,

I have been dealing with an internal struggle on and off for the past little while already and today it seems to have gotten to a point where I'm ready to ask some advice on the matter. It is the struggle between being a good friend and selfishness.

I have felt like a selfish person (in the bad way) for a while now, dealing with my problems, talking about myself a lot (this issue is here while writing this as well) and laying focus on myself. I've really taken notice of it this last year and I've decided I don't like being selfish. I want to be less selfish and focus more on the people around me. I want to hear them out, I want to help them with their struggles and I want them to be in a place where they enjoy being.

This however goes against the other side of me, the side of me that is hurting, that is in pain and that has helped me survive for the past like 5 years. I have no official diagnosis, but I'm pretty sure I am suffering of some form of depression, given how lazy I have gotten and how I beat myself up, both emotionally and in some ways physically as well (with junk food, taking care of my body etc).

Now that you know the two sides that are at play, I'd love like to explain the situation and go through some of the internal debate that rages within me. A good friend of mine is going through a tough spell in life. They have just broken up with their SO last week and yesterday they had some news that causes them to think their job might not be as secure as they had previously thought.

Over the course of this last week I've been talking to them about their breakup and I've kept on tell them I'm there for them and they need to reach out if they want my help and I've offered to hang out in voice chat with them when they're lonely in the mornings etc, been DMing with them on an almost daily basis to talk them through the rough patches and basically offering my support, trying to tell them everything will be alright and things will be better in the future. This has been going on for a week now and I totally get they are feeling down and in the dumps and life is taking a shit on them right now and I've been there and I know you have too.

However, since yesterday morning I've felt actually fairly happy since a while. Even though there's plenty of nasty dark clouds drifting over towards me as well, but I've not really had a break in the grey clouds that have been the day-to-day of my internal thoughts over the past 5 or so years, so to finally have a glimpse of a blue sky and some sunshine really gave me a good boost.

Today however, with my friend taking a few steps back down their emotional state where they were just last week as well, I am having a serious discussion on both sides of my being. On the one hand I want to be a good friend for them and be there for them,  I want to offer my support to them, I want to reach out to them and do .... I don't actually know what to do, I have no idea what to say or do to help them out, I know the feeling is shit and I've not really conquered it myself, so I don't know what other advice I can give besides ""hey things will be alright"". But I want to be there for them, I want them to not feel as shit as I have, or maybe improve it somehow. On the other hand, that would probably require more voice chat's as well, but I personally don't really enjoy the voice chats that much and on top of that, I'm feeling fairly alright today and yesterday and I don't want to go back to that place myself either, it's been a while since I left that place.

The thing is, this friend hasn't reached out to me today and from where I'm standing, I don't think it likely they will. They haven't asked me to hop into voice, they haven't asked me to DM them asking them to go into more detail on what they are feeling and they haven't asked for my support and part of me is going ""I really don't want to reach out to them again. It's all I've done for the past week or so and I've set aside my dislike for voice chats etc. to be there for them, I've offered to watch their favorite TV show with them, etc., all for them. I myself am feeling quite alright generally speaking and I don't want their 'negativity' (big word, I know they can't help it, but at the end of the day it is negativity) to ruin my day too. My past years have been bad enough by themselves. Let them reach out to me and maybe I'll consider responding, but maybe also not because of the last reason"".

On the other side however, I have this part of me going ""Dude. You offered to be their friend, you have on multiple occasions told them you want to be there for them and you want to help them. You have also decided that you want to try to not be as selfish as you have been and still are and it takes a lot of effort to be selfless, but c'mon, you made promises and you genuinely also want to be there for this person and you can't even be selfless for that. How can you call yourself a good friend if you can't even put your own feelings aside for a friend going through a deep deep valley in their life?""

Which gets answered with a ""yeah, and where was this friend when I was going through these deep valleys huh? Where were they for me?"", which sounds an awful lot like Ego, I do realize that.

To which the other side responds with ""What don't you understand about being selfless? The whole point is that you do it and not expect anything in return. Just because they weren't there for you doesn't mean you can't be there for them. Also you didn't reach out to them either, much like they are not reaching out to you right now and you know how shitty you felt. Maybe instead of letting them go through the same thing you went through you can reach out and they'll have a much easier time than you still have"".

**Question**  
So here finally I have the question for all of you: How do you deal with this sort of internal struggle? How do I make the right choice? Both for my friend and for me if at all possible? This struggle between selfishness (and Ego is on that team here and there as well) and between caring for others is a tough one and I don't know how to make this call, I need some help and I could ask my mother, but it feels like she is biased and I won't be getting the answer on *how* to deal with this and more on what to do in the situation, which doesn't help for any future similar situations.

Any advice or help would be much appreciated and even if you don't want to comment or plan to comment, thank you for reading through it all, it's been a long read and I appreciate it. I hope your day is going well and either way, I hope it only gets better for you.

Sincerely yours,",10,2,2,1.0,0,,/r/Advice/comments/l0gykk/struggling_with_selfishness_versus_being_there/,False,True
1977,Advice,2022-08-29 21:47:02,introvertedfreak21,Best way to get rid of ants?,"So, I've had an issue with ants for a long time. I've tried thus shaker bag of ants killer and put around the outside of my house but they came back, I've kept a spray bottle of water, bleach, and peppermint to kill them when I see them in the house. I made sure there was no food left on dishes I put in the sink, and so on. Recently I noticed they came back and it's through a seal break on our back door. We rent so we can't really do anything and if we say we found the seal break because of ants, we are told bugs are our problems to deal with. I couldn't really figure out what they were after because they were in an area that we don't eat near and isn't close to the sink. Earlier today I decided to see how many packaged muffins we had left since we buy them in bulk. Come to find out, the ants were trying to get to the muffins. It seems the packaging was well sealed because they couldn't get through. They mostly wanted the chocolate muffin so I just took the few muffins we had out of the box, put them in a gallon ziploc bag, and threw the box away. I could see in the packaging that there were no ants in the food, just crawling on the plastic trying to get in. So, I've come to ask what others recommend. I can't afford the expense of calling an exterminator nor is the problem bad enough that I need one. Just a few ants get in but nothing too crazy and they are small black ants and we don't really get bit by them.",3,1,1,0.67,0,,/r/Advice/comments/x10wcg/best_way_to_get_rid_of_ants/,False,True
1989,Advice,2021-10-24 00:26:29,introvertedfreak21,Help cheering up a partner,"So, my boyfriend(25) and I(24f) have been together for almost five years. Even though we've had all this time together, I sometimes fill struggle to figure out how to cheer him up. One thing to consider is that he has very mild autism, its almost unnoticeable to most people. I only see small things with it, like a lack of empathy sometimes.

My problem I think lays mainly in helping make him feel better about himself. We come from very different backgrounds. I grew up poor, had two family vacations my whole life. My family scraped by with what they could and they never made it easy on themselves. They liked to drink and party like they were in their 20's and use their kids as therapists. I grew up in a very unstable home so any achievements I made, no matter the size, meant a lot to me. Buying my own car on an auto loan meant a lot even though it was totaled a year later. Moving out on my own meant alot, even if I had to have help to do it. Every little step meant something big to me.

My boyfriend is the opposite. His dad pretty much went to the military, worked on planes there, and once he was out, pretty much got a really good job. He wasn't set for life by any means. He had a wife with two kids not his own to take care and then his own kid as well. He had to not only work his job building planes, but a second one to keep up with the problems around his wife. Once she had passed away, his dad used that money form her death to just take the kids of a bunch of vacations. He didn't want to think of his grief, he didn't want his kids sad. I understand the sentiment but at the end of the day, I feel he should've given his children time to process their grief and have them a stable environment.  My boyfriend had been on more vacations than just the ones right after his mom's passing. He was only 14 at the time, once his dad moved on and met another woman who also had a good income, they took a lot of vacations and usually brought their families with them. 

But besides the vacations, Ben's dad never really pushed him much in school to do well. Always told him that to just go into the military and they will set you up for life. He has great ASVAB scores but because of his autism, he refused to see the military as his family. They couldn't break him like other soliders but also he had a hole in his heart they worried about. He finished basically training but they just discharged him. He hurt a lot after that, he felt like such a let down and couldn't believe he failed. Next he went and tried going to school to become a jet mechanic like his dad, even got a huge loan on his head just in hopes that would pan out. He did great in the classes, always good scores. But when it came to the final tests, he couldn't pass them. Not all his fault, a part of the test was not taught to him which was wielding metal together. After spending too much many and failing too many times, he gave up on that path and once again, felt like a failure. Nowadays, he can't seem to shake that feeling. I've tried my best to make him feel better but I just don't know how. I've slowly been working on his issues form the problems his family caused, like getting him use to being touched, pointing out stuff he shouldn't bring up around others, and helping him show its safe to come to me when he feels down. I know it isn't easy, his family really didn't treat him with much love as a kid.

I mainly just want any advice on how to help show him he's not a failure, that he can accomplish things on his own and doesn't need to rely on others. He mainly worries about the student loan on his head as its about $29k left on it form the original $40k. I try to remind him of what things he has accomplished but they all seem like small stuff to him, like living on his own with me and my roommate. It also doesn't help that his dad makes it seem easy to just be successful and pressures him to do better as an adult. He also acts like that just because Ben is over 21, he should have his life figured out.

Any advice would be appreciated. I just love him so much and want him happy.",0,1,1,0.67,0,,/r/Advice/comments/qeh49r/help_cheering_up_a_partner/,False,True

1994,Advice,2021-08-12 23:28:25,introvertedfreak21,Struggles wirh finding a woman,"I'm a 24 year old bisexual female. I've been in a committed relationship with my 25 year old boyfriend for 5 years now. Since I grew up in the South where there isn't a large LGBT community, it was hard to find girls to date before I was with my boyfriend. He's very open minded and doesn't mind me trying to just find a woman to mess around with. I think part of it is because he wants me to get over my trust issues with women since I've had a lot of failed mother figures and terrible female friends.

For awhile, I gave up on trying to find a girl. This is because it was just hard. I'd match with a girl, we would chat for awhile and she would either just ghost me after a week or start making plans to meet and just never confirm a time and date. Recently, my best friend(25m) got a girlfriend who is also bisexual. She's really cool but he's made it pretty clear he is not open to her being with anyone but him. I respect that but it has made me want to try again because she is so very open about being bisexual and it was just such a breath of fresh air to me. I never realized how suffocating living in the south really is to me. I plan to move eventually.

Now my current issue. I made a tinder looking for only girls. I've managed to get a good few matches and I messaged most of them first. Only one responded back and she just stopped talking suddenly too. The others just don't respond. I guess I just get discouraged easily. I wanted maybe some tips or advice on how to handle this situation. Maybe there is a certain way I talk that turns them away, maybe they expect me to move faster than I actually do. I try to at least get to know the people I talk to before I think about moving to intimate stuff.",7,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/Advice/comments/p3bj2r/struggles_wirh_finding_a_woman/,False,True
2000,Advice,2021-06-01 21:19:38,introvertedfreak21,Unsure on reconnecting with my older half-sister,"Hi, I'm a 23 female and this is gonna be kinda long.

Some back story first to get a full picture. My sister and I share a mom but not a dad and have a six year age gap. My parents split when I was 3 in an ugly divorce. My dad choose to try and be a part of my life still and I think my sister resented that because her dad just left. My dad tried his best to also be a father to her, he did help raise her with my mom before the divorce but she didn't want him as a dad after the divorce. 

Up until I was 11, I lived with my mom and sister. Most of the memories are blurry to me as I was forced to take heavy medication for ADHD.  When I was 11, my dad got custody because my mother was a drug addict and would let my sister and I live in filth. It was bad, as in cat feces and empty pill bottles all over the floors, flea infested beds, I even found an old report card form my time there were I had missed 93 days of school. We lived in a house my grandfather owned, once he came to live with us, he helped get rid of most of the cats, cleaned the house up, and helped take care of my sister and I. Since she was so much older, when my sister was home, she would either take care of me or completely shut me out. Most times it was my grandfather but he had to work a lot and this was all because my mom would just sleep all day. My grandfather wasn't without his vices too but they were much more minor, just stuff like some pot or beer when he wasn't working. That was all just to give an idea of the kinda home I had then. 

When I was 13, my dad managed to ween me off the meds enough that the doctors said I could completely stop taking them, he let me make that choice and I stopped taking them, I couldn't stand them. They made me feel less me, like I was a watered down version of myself that could only really think all the time. Shortly after that, I remembered parts of how bad living with my mom was. I remembered how bad it was and living with my dad made me realize that wasn't normal. I thought that my mom needed help, a push to make herself better. So, I cut contact with her until she got sober. I kept in contact with my grandfather and sister for a few months after but seeing them just made the decision harder. They would talk about how good she was doing and that I should come see her, trying to make me feel guilty. More than anything, they blamed it all on my dad. I had to cut contact with them too.

When I was 15, almost 16, I decided to reach out to them again. It was because I wanted to know more about my mom and hope she was better. It was emotional to say the least. What I remember most was being able to tell who my sister and grandfather was but then seeing this woman behind my sister with dark hair and was very thin. I didn't realize who she was till she hugged me and cried about her baby. I didn't recognize my own mother. She went form being 300lbs to only 95lbs at 5'4"". She didn't look healthy, she scared me honestly. She looked like skin and bones. I know now that it was probably a combination of loose skin and drugs that made her that way. It wasn't a good idea to see them, I honestly regret it. They filled my head with these lies about my dad, tried to make me believe he was abusing me(I had bad ance that he would pop sometimes which hurt but it wasn't abuse) and just all these nasty things. My mom ended up calling child.protective services on my dad. After my dad got me back home, he talked to me about what happened and helped me see that my mom and sister just used me to hurt him again and what they said wasn't true. I decided to cut contact again after that happened.

A year passed and with it, so did my mom. She died of s drug overdose and that fact ripped me up inside. I believed so heavily that one day she would overcome her addiction so we could have a healthy relationship, I really wanted to believe she loved me more than drugs so to die in such a manner hurt. I remember the morning my dad told me, he work me up after my stepsister left for school, made my favorite breakfast sandwich and sat at the table. As soon as he told me, I just broke down in tears. I still tear up thinking about it. He let me stay home from school so I could process my feelings. That Saturday, we went to see my sister and grandfather to mourn with them. I wanted to see my uncle too but he was inside so I left my dad's side to go see my uncle. I talk to him when my sister came in the room. I gave him a hug and my sister joined the hug. Then she whispered in my ear how my mom couldn't live without her baby. She put the thought in my head that my mom's death might not have been an accident. I ran back to my dad crying, told him what my sister said and we went home after that. We went to the funeral, sitting away from my sister and grandfather while it happened. I cried the whole funeral, it was just hard to accept she was gone and I struggled for years on how to accept her death and how she died. I eventually accepted that her death was an accident and that there was no deeper meaning behind it. My sister blamed my dad for her death and why I didn't talk to her anymore. She would every now and again send me a message on facebook about her missing me and how my dad was keeping us apart like he controlled me.

My dad is no saint though. He was a great dad for most of my life but in the end, he made mistakes too. I felt more like just a tool while living with him and my step mom. She treated me like a second-class person, like I was below her and convinced my dad that I was mean to her for no reason. He always promised to leave her but never did. For a year he had a lot of seizures that was linked to a clogged artery that really affected how he thinks and acts now. Its probably best he was with her for that because she has a lot of experience with seizures and does her best to take care of him. I don't like her still but as an adult, we get along. She stopped trying to be a mom to me and has just become my dad's wife.

Now to today. I never had the real strong urge to reach out to my sister. She seemed to being going down the same path our mom took, doing drugs, dropped out of school, never got a job, and just lived off the money the government would give her and my grandfather for the three kids she had with her drug dealer boyfriend. Maybe I'm really just looking for validation on keeping things the way they are. I briefly felt like maybe reaching out wouldn't be bad if I set firm boundaries with her and just finally get more information about my mom. I always felt like part of me was missing, I never really knew my mom at all and only got bits and pieces about who she was form my dad. She was already lost to drugs by the time I could remember anything about her. I am just unsure if I should reach out to her, if I really need that kind of trouble in my life. Keeping out of contact would change nothing about my life as it is and I'm content with where I am as a person but reaching out feels like it might just cause more problems in the long run and add really nothing to my life as is. I might also just be looking for a support system in the wrong way, its hard to live life when the people you expect to support you have failed you a lot as well. Honestly, I only really have three people I feel won't ever hurt me or just leave me. So, any advice would be helpful, I might just choose to keep out of contact because it just feels like the best option since she seems so convinced that my dad is to blame and may be beyond reasoning out of that.",0,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/Advice/comments/nq4xct/unsure_on_reconnecting_with_my_older_halfsister/,False,True
2001,Advice,2021-05-29 23:49:07,introvertedfreak21,Advice on becoming normal after leaving an adusive home,"This one will probably be really long as there is a lot to unpack. I am a 23 female.

To start, I moved out of my dad and step mom's home in December 2020. I couldn't be happier, this has been one of the best things for my mental health but I am struggling with it at the same time.

It really never hit me how bad my home life was until I got into a healthy relationship with my bf, he has been very supportive and helped me a lot when things with my family was bad. I would like to say it wasn't always bad, it was mainly just my step mom and I butting heads a lot because she couldn't understand why I wouldn't want to be more girly and blamed every issue I had on ADHD and always comparing me to my little sister, her daughter form a previous marriage. I had a good relationship with my dad and stepsister, it was mainly just my step mom I had issues with but it wasn't bad until we moved form our family home in a quiet neighborhood to this home far form the city with lots of land.

After the move, things didn't go well. My parents went into a bunch of debt to get that home and get it the way they wanted. That seemed fine because my dad had a job he was making decent money at but it wasn't a stable enough job, it was all contract work for putting appliances in people's homes. Things weren't good between my dad and his boss so he tried going solo. The money issues piled up, dad wasn't making a lot of money and my stepmom's job was only making sure ends meet, debts weren't getting paid. There were times I had to pay our electric bill because someone showed up to shut it off while I was home alone form work.

They charged me crazy high for rent in a home with three adults and one minor(my sister was in highschool most of this time up until May of last year). It went form 300 to 400 to 600 for my bedroom. I also had to pay my own car insurance and all issues that arose with that car. It wasn't easy, I could never save money because I couldn't stand being there. I would make sure to be gone every minute my parents were awake. Leave two hours before my shift just so I could be gone, hang out at my bf's after work just to stay gone, be at his house all weekend long. Just. To. Be. Gone. I couldn't take it because almost every night someone was drunk or high and the other was screaming. Some nights I'd come home from a 12hr shift at work only for them to have all their friends over to be loud and drunk by the pool. It was like living with bad college roommates and I was the only adult. 

I hated the holidays because of them. I remember Christmas being the worst. One christmas my dad threatened to not give my sister and I anything at all because we whined a little about some christmas photos. Even though stepmom made us stand outside in cold weather in Christmas dresses. We did it, we did our best to pose but we whined a little because we were cold. We were also 21 and 16. Another Christmas was ruined because my dad mixed alcohol and Xannax together. Most know not to do this, we told him several times that he becomes so ugly to us when he does. He did it anyways, yelled and screamed at us about not caring about him and demanded that I, his own daughter, go get his gun and let him shoot himself in the head. He eventually went outside to sit in his truck because we wouldn't listen to him, my step mom had to fight him to get his pistol away because we honestly didn't want him dead. We were so thankful the neighbors didn't call the cops form their screaming. I remember at one point hiding myself and my sister in my room form my father as he and step mom screamed at each other that night. Once he left for his truck, we were able to try and do Christmas Eve stuff together and he eventually came back inside and apologized for being ugly. That was the last Christmas Ever I spent with them, I made sure to get out before the next one.

Now, the part I need advice on as that was all to get an idea of where my problems come from.

I currently live with my bf and our mutual male best friend, Ron. Bf and I both come from small families, him being the baby. Ron however comes from a happy split family. His dad has two other sons and three stepkids, all get along well. His mom had two more kids as well. Ron is the oldest of 7 kids so he is use to always having someone around and people to mess with.

Mainly just with Ron because he will just come by and touch me, just walk past me to get to the fridge, or make noises to mimic a show I'm watching. Its all harmless stuff and I know but I'm just so use to being combative that I have to keep catching myself from starting a fight needlessly.

I'm a female player in a online gaming community. I've worked really hard for our team and make sure we are supplied, farming for others and helping other get geared. I pass on things I need to help others and I think I've set a bad precedence because now there's no prio for gear. I'm watching teammates gear multiple characters and I'm struggling with my main.

I had to be flexible and change my spec and relearn a totally new one for the good of the team. I was told that I'd be prio'ed for gear and anyway, no one else really needed gear anymore anyway. So basically I'm getting the scraps.

So my leader keeps telling me I need to upgrade my gear. The problem is that the gear I need isn't dropping and when it does other people are needing it as well. Tonight an alt character got the gear my lead keeps telling me to get! Then they ended up trading it to another player. I swear it's a ""good 'ol boy system"" at play.

I want to leave but I have a bunch of people I'm attached to within the group that are not at fault as well as family and IRL friends that play. If I leave it will create a mess for them but I'm doubtful anything will change if I stay. I don't want to be seen as throwing a tantrum to try to get my way.

I've worked so hard for this group but feel completely used, lied to and disrespected.

I play too much to simply walk away and because of a disability this is my main socialization. I can change realms but would have to start over by myself and meet new people.

Thoughts would be appreciated. Am I over reacting over a game? Am I taking it too personal?",0,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/Advice/comments/13t440c/online_gaming_relationships/,False,False

219,Advice,2023-05-27 10:40:53,throwraFrequentRow2,How do I move on from something like this?,"Was I potentially dealing with a narcissist?


In 2021 I was in a position financially, emotionally to be ready for a relationship 

I’d never had a boyfriend because for some reason I never felt attracted to anyone. Like kissing made me feel weird 

And I met a man who had just weeks ago immigrated to this country and had downloaded tinder.

We talked for just over a month until I was so ready to meet him. He was putting it off, I think cause he had just moved here and was unsettled. But he seemed keen, constantly texting me with updates about his day etc 

So I set up the first date. I was on a camping trip with friends which happened to be down the road from his house, so one evening I popped out to meet him. We had a great time, instant chemistry and amazing chats. He texted me how much he fancied me and couldn’t wait to see me again

For the first time in my life, I loved our kissing. They were passionate and intense chemistry, and I enjoyed sex for the first time too. I thought I’d finally met my person. I was always turned on around him and I was the one always initiating sex 

And from that point, we were dating. I had to plan all the dates as I was the one with the car. I would pick him up and we would go hang out somewhere outdoors.

The chats we had were amazing. Shared experiences of grief and interest in music. We would lay in the park and talk forever. He was kind and sensitive and reassured me he was a nice guy as I was cautious and apprehensive with dating. He told me all his exes still want to be friends with him as they know he’s nice and harmless.

I liked the pace of the relationship too, quick to become comfortable but not rushing things. He seemed very into me, soppy messages, loads of compliments and talks of the future. I felt safe and comfortable.I’ve never had a man I like, be interested back too so my feelings were amazing 

At 3 months, I moved closer to his town, not just to be closer to him but to be closer to my work too. 

It was at that point, my housemates pointed out I was doing s lot for him and he didn’t take me on dates. I cooked him dinners and planned fun things. I was supportive to help him find a new job etc . When he was sick, I was out getting him meds and stuff for his back ache. I felt like the adult in the relationship 

I brought up the lack of dates one day. I told him ‘I feel I do a lot when it comes to planning dates. I would really like it if you took the initiative to plan things. It doesn’t need to be expensive or even cost anything.’ He came up with some weird excuses like I was better at planning bla bla bla. Even on my birthday there was no effort 

But from that point, I felt a massive change in him. He was no longer super kind and friendly to me. He gave me very dirty evil looks and little criticisms all the time. When I brought up further needs, again in a sensitive way, I was told I was pressuring and manipulative. He talked about his ex girlfriends non stop. 

His attitude toward me got worse, he seemed so annoyed by everything. Even accusing me of being bad at planning and unable to understand sarcasm. He never even made an effort to get me food and drink when I stayed at his, I would have to make sure to bring my own food so I didn’t get hungry. Even him getting me a glass of water always seemed a big annoying effort for him

At the same time I was going through a hard time with loss of my job, some awful housemates, family illness and grief from loss of a family member 

He dumped me and told me he dated me because he was lonely and never fe in love

He never even spoke to me like he did with his exes, which hurts and makes me wonder what’s wrong with me",4,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/Advice/comments/13t4321/how_do_i_move_on_from_something_like_this/,False,False
220,Advice,2023-05-27 10:40:00,Foxglove_4,Healthcare Provider Won't Resend Check that Bounced,"So back in April I received a $30.00 refund from my healthcare provider, and I attempted to cash it on my banking app. I checked a few days later and the amount still wasn't there, and then I received both a digital and in person letter from my provider saying I was one of many to receive a duplicate check, so my check did not go through and I cannot cash it.

I call the number for Accounts Payable that they put on the letter about 10 different times, and each time the person on the line did not understand my issue, they seem Just as confused as I am.

I was even given 2 other numbers from them that directed me to billing, and they did not understand my problem either.

&#x200B;

Eventually, I got one of the agents to email my issue to their manager, since no one was able to help. I finally received an email saying that they would look into it and re-issue me a new check. I ALMOST got it and then they sent me another email shortly after saying that my check's funds were deposited, which is not true. There was no pending funds or deposited funds anytime for that amount in the month of April on my bank statements.

&#x200B;

It has been over a month and I am sick of jumping through hoops for what should have been a simple fix, and I know $30.00 is not a lot to some people but that could really help me out.

&#x200B;

For more background information, I have been with this provider since 2020 and my parents also received a check from them last month, only there's DID go through, so I highly doubt this is a scam, just seems very fishy to me and I don't know how to proceed.

223,Advice,2023-05-27 10:32:05,Sho_up,Should I break up with my boyfriend?,"So long story here. Buckle up. (I shall use fake names for this story) 

Logan and I (Sara) have been together for 4 years this December. Met when we were 18 on tinder and clicked and have been together ever since. We will be turning 22 this year. I am 3 months older September 2001 and he’s December 2001. We have similar interests and we like spending time together, we’re close and he’s my best friend. Honestly we’ve raised each other and part of me can’t imagine my life without him. We’ve been living together for just over 2 years and have lived with his parents, on our own and then with my younger sister. 

We’ve been through so much together, his parents (very toxic) and their treatment of me, which we’ve sorted but still is kinda painful, my mums death (she was a narcissist but I’m her oldest daughter and we were still quite close), my struggles with obesity and PCOS/endometriosis, his poor mental health and undiagnosed depression, financial hardship, Covid 19 and the Aus NSW lockdowns, my complicated relationship with my father and younger brother and so much more. 

Although the main reasons I’m thinking about leaving him are as follows. 

1. Tonight he got upset and overwhelmed and punched a hole in our garage door, this isn’t the first time he’s done something like this. Once he was so angry he threw a McFlurry at the ground and screamed, he broke his hand in 2 places in early 2021 from punching a floor. He knows this behaviour triggers me as my boyfriend before him threw a brick through my window and constantly screamed at me for the little things which has caused me some trauma. I’ve attempted to communicate with him multiple times and he acknowledges every-time, this happens usually once or twice a year, although the arguments and screaming has picked up over the last 3-4 months. 

2. I’m not feeling very sexually satisfied. We have our once a week and it’s usually hand stuff which is okay but I’ve expressed an interest into other things and a different frequency and I’m denied or we agree and then it’s the same stuff every-time. Consent is important and I do respect his boundaries but even then he finishes and it takes me ages to because I’m not 100% enjoying myself. 

3. We have been together 3.5 years and not once has this man cooked me a meal, yes he’s made me toast and noodles, and grabbed the Uber eats from the door, but he’s never made me a meal because “my cooking tastes better”. We’ve talked about weaponised incompetence he is quite intelligent and knows how to make meals, and he says he will try harder and hasn’t.

4. Also not once has he planned a date, he’s paid for quite a few but never called to book a table or surprise me with something special I’ve booked and organised every single one in all 3.5 years. He also hasn’t bothered to get his licence so I do ferry him around quite a bit (contributes to gas and rego) and even though again I have tried to communicate with him about these issues I am met with “I will try harder” and “I don’t want to get my licence” “I don’t like driving” etc, even though our lives with benefit greatly from him driving, taking himself places, going to his own appointments etc. 

5. Final main point is I basically mange his life. I have a genuine belief that if I don’t run his errands for him he wouldn’t do it. He is listed as a dependent under me on his doctors forms because he doesn’t want his own account, I have to remind him to call his grandparents, I go out and get him new socks when his got lost or have holes, sew the holes in his pants, remind him to pack lunch and take house eyes etc and drop off lunch/house keys when he does forget. it makes me feel like his mum which I hate. I have mentioned little things here and there regarding this specific issue but we haven’t had a massive conversation. 

I would like to add to some of the positives as I feel like so far I’ve only focused on the negatives. 

He is incredibly funny and intelligent, in my eyes physically he is beautiful, flawed like every human but somehow I feel I can look past almost anything he does and be okay. When I see him I see home, comfort and fun. He is generous, has great friends and people skills, he usually shower with me. Washes my hair and face, cuddles me when I need, strokes my hair. He smells great even when he doesn’t and we have a 2 thirds 1 third on the finance split in our house. Logan works a full time job and I have a permanent part time job and study. He washes clothes for me and takes on and puts on my shoes for me when I get home/leave for work. 

I guess my main issue is am I staying with him because I’m comfortable or am I genuinely willing to look past these rough times and move on with him? I can see us getting married (although I’m not sure how he feels about commitment) and having children, I can see him being a great dad.

My mom passed away a few years ago but had an agreement with her job through her insurance to gift a family member a certain amount of money for life every month after she passes away. I have a small family with just my sister, dad and me. So my mom near the end of her life decided to give my sister the amount of $500 bc it was the most amount she qualified for. (I would of gotten $350.) My sister who is 8 years older, also bought her first home before that time and is renting it out with a slight profit. My mom also thought my sister would use the extra $500 for life for helping pay the mortgage of the Maple house, as we call it. The one thing my mom left me was a stock account worth $5000. My mom loved us very much equally. We never had the conversation about the fairness of the distribution of money. Well it’s been about 2 years since my mom passed and my sister has been receiving a free $500 every month since she passed, for the rest of her life. If you do the math, in 40 years it will be close to $240,000 she would of gotten for free. 
Well my dad’s health is declining and we are setting up a trust. We are having a discussion, and we talked about making things 50/50 between us so there is no bad blood with money between us. She has a house with her husband and the other home she rents out. I told her how I felt it’s unfair that she is getting all this money and if it was are gonna be 50/50 from the parents then shouldn’t that be apart of that too? 
After many discussions, she agreed it’s better to pay half than have bad blood between us. I told her that if things were reversed and I got the gift of $350, I would’ve shared 50/50 with her. We are the only family we have, and we should share things equally for when my dad passes away.

Do you think it’s wrong for me to think we should share this $500 for life? Or is that fair to be equals with everything?",0,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/Advice/comments/13t3wfn/siblings_money_problem_advice/,False,False
