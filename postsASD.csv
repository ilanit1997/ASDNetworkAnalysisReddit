2,AutisticAdults,2023-05-27 04:33:12,Putrid-Occasion1881,Autism and BPD? *Vent,"I got diagnosed with autism as an adult but I know of at least 2 people that are knowledgeable on both disorders and who know I'm autistic, that have noticed enough symptoms of BPD in me to ask my partner directly if I have this comorbidity. He said the idea has also crossed his mind since we met. 

I don't have a BPD diagnosis and none of my healthcare providers have mentioned it to me in my life but then again they didn't catch the autism until I brought it up either. I was curious that so many people were seeing this disorder in me so I did some research into it and it was uncomfortable how relatable it felt. I looked into specifically how autism and BPD can overlap and how they differ and I still relate very much to both. 

I don't really know what I'm looking for. For some reason I thought my autism diagnosis would be the last major psychiatric diagnosis I would receive in my life so I don't think I want to pursue if I would qualify for a formal diagnosis right now. I think I'm just uncomfortable because it feels like every time I finally figure out what's going on with me, there ends up being something else still.

 Does anyone else have experience with this comorbidity? Am I leaping to conclusions here by assuming there's a high chance I have this disorder based on my internet research and observations from others alone? This is how I discovered my autism after all. Is it worth bringing up to my therapist and/or psychiatrist to see what they think? I worry they'll think I'm being dramatic and that I'm looking for something to be wrong with me. 

If anyone has advice, can direct me to related resources, or would be willing to possibly tolerate me venting about this some more, I'd like to know.

11,AutisticAdults,2023-05-26 17:53:47,serromani,How do I respond to this compliment from my boss??,"I'm really bad at receiving compliments, which usually is just a bit of an awkward personality trait but isn't really that big of a deal. When the compliment is coming from my direct supervisor, though, I really feel like I should learn to respond appropriately.

I'm currently doing some light freelancing work editing and proofreading for the marketing firm my dad works at (I had to go through the whole interview process and testing to prove I'm qualified, so it's not just something I was handed due to nepotism-- especially since he doesn't even work in the department involved with copywriting at all).

I was assigned my first workload today, and I emailed my boss asking a clarifying question about exactly what all she wanted my notes on. I explained that I didn't want to offend anyone by overstepping beyond my jurisdiction and making unwelcome suggestions.

She responded by telling me to go ahead and include any suggestions I felt may improve things, and when I thanked her she replied ""You are so great!  üòä"". I'm not really sure if I'm supposed to respond to that, and if I am I have no idea what to say.

I know she probably has a friendlier than normal tone with me because she's (sort of) known me since I was younger (via occasional company holiday parties with my dad, etc), but that compliment just feels so broad that I really don't know how to address it gracefully.

What do you think I should do? Does this warrant a response, and if so, how might I go about wording it?

12,AutisticAdults,2023-05-26 16:10:20,,Did anyone else internalize that ‚Äúhorrified‚Äù look people can give us for making social mistakes?,"I never once thought to question it. Everyone acts like that‚Äôs the ‚Äúright‚Äù way to show someone they‚Äôre doing something ‚Äúwrong.‚Äù But every time it stung so bad, and I interpreted that look as meaning *I am a disgusting stain on the Earth.* Even when I observe people making this face to others, I feel the same way, they are sending a message that tells the person they‚Äôre disgusting. It‚Äôs not simply displeasure or disapproval, I‚Äôve seen that, that horrified look is sending a different message, a destructive message. That look does not say I or someone else *did something wrong* it says mine or another persons *existence is wrong*. 

I don‚Äôt know this is so confusing. I‚Äôve found myself making that same look thinking ‚Äúthis is how I‚Äôm supposed to show disapproval, I‚Äôm just being like everyone else,‚Äù but it feels so wrong. SO WRONG. My moral compass screams to me that *this is not the right way to show disapproval despite the fact that it‚Äôs the socially acceptable way of showing disapproval.* It feels fundamentally dehumanizing on either end. I don‚Äôt know how to explain this to most people because for them it‚Äôs ‚Äúugh! That‚Äôs just the way the world is!‚Äù But I hope someone here understands what I mean. I‚Äôm not trying to fight the fact that this is what people do to show disapproval, I understand that and I can respect that while believing that this method of showing disapproval is destructive. It‚Äôs *shame*.

I get that most of us hate the whole ‚Äúit‚Äôs not what you say it‚Äôs how you say it‚Äù type of thing, and right now it sounds like I‚Äôm being like that, but honestly what I hate most about that phrase is that people often hold us to different standards just to put us down‚Ä¶not cause they care about the morality of things.

Edit: I just need to get this out somewhere. I‚Äôve violated my moral compass trying to keep up with this social stuff that I‚Äôm trying to learn. And I feel disgusting inside. I feel so disgusting.

16,AutisticAdults,2023-05-26 15:00:04,blushvibe,30/M autistic/ADHD partner fixates on cat fur?,"Hi there! I‚Äôm really happy I found this community, and I‚Äôm wondering if someone can shed some light on a question my partner and I have had for a while now. 

My fianc√© is 30, and a late diagnosis for both autism and ADHD. When he was around college age, his parents got their first pet cats for the family. He‚Äôd had experience with animals before, of course, but these were his first ‚Äúpets‚Äù and thus the first animals to really spend time with him in a way other people could observe. 

They noticed he was intently fixated on their cats‚Äô fur and would politely point it out to him (without telling him to ‚Äústop‚Äù‚Äîthey were pretty gentle with him) but he couldn‚Äôt stop for more than a little bit. The physical act is difficult to explain, but almost every time he‚Äôs around our black cat, he ‚Äúinspects‚Äù her fur intently through staring, and moving small bits of her fur around to see down to her skin, or to maybe see underside of her coat? Almost like the way monkeys clean each other, but he‚Äôs not picking anything off of her? 

It doesn‚Äôt hurt our cat at all, and is totally harmless, but he does it a lot, and when he does, it‚Äôs really hard to break him out of it. He asked me to just gently nudge his hand out of the way when I see him doing it while we‚Äôre all family cuddling together, but he goes right back to it immediately. I‚Äôve nudged him like 5-10 times in a row consistently, and it hasn‚Äôt helped. 

He doesn‚Äôt know why he does it, and it came on very very late in life, as you can see. He does stim with his own hair a lot (curling the front piece around his finger near his forehead)  and likes to rub one spot for a long period of time (when he‚Äôs holding me, he‚Äôll move his thumb back and forth rapidly on my skin‚Äîthis is sometimes painful for me) so he‚Äôs very tactile. 

We‚Äôre both at a loss for an explanation and are wondering if anyone else has experienced this in their partner, or does it themselves? Maybe someone can shed some light on this for us?

22,AutisticAdults,2023-05-26 03:29:57,Scout1769,I Firmly believe I have ASD. Any advice for a guy just learning about the spectrum at 29?,"My entire life I‚Äôve always been, different. Growing up, kids and even adults would see me in a very unique light but would always dismiss it as ‚Äúsilly little quirks‚Äù or ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just how he is‚Äù. I was diagnosed with ADHD around 1st grade and I took Adderall until 2012. I never really considered anything more but something was/has always been‚Ä¶off about me and  my social understanding never matched even the other individuals that had ADHD. 

Where do I start? I find it impossible to control the volume of my voice, I don‚Äôt know (still) when to talk in turn without accidentally interrupting. If someone explains something one way and I explain the exact same thing but from my vantage no one knows what I‚Äôm talking about. Loud sudden noises (like fireworks and gunfire give me anxiety). I have to do thing in a certain order and it makes me angry if things get out of whack. I seem to talk normal in my head and writing/typing but I struggle to talk to others and I am amazed if a conversation goes remotely well despite rehearsing it in my head over and over. Eye contact makes me uncomfortable. People think I‚Äôm being mean or rude when I feel like I‚Äôm completely neutral or even friendly. I repeat myself a lot, and even edited this post because I kept repeating myself. When confronted, yelled at, or even anxious or overwhelmed I have bad verbal shutdowns, where I just panic in my head but on the outside I‚Äôm just blankly staring or looking down. There is so much more. 

I recently found a paper from kindergarten regarding transitioning into first grade and the observations about me that the teacher and nurse at the school had made that year executed by the guidance counselor, nurse, and a doctor they had come in the school each year (this was 1999 in a little backwoods country school). It examined basic physical, linguistic, and cognitive functions at that age. I was 5-6 at the time. I had a hard time speaking and I remember that part, they had me in a 1 on 1 language class with the guidance counselor. At the bottom of the paper was additional notes that read:

‚ÄúSpeech Language -Diagnostic
We highly recommend special classes for **** 

Observations:
 **** shows high potential for PDD-NOS & ADHD. We advise you as the parent/guardian of **** that he sees his pediatrician before the new school year. 
*There is more to the note but there is an old stain that made some if it illegible.‚Äù

From my understanding PDD-NOS was an old diagnostic criteria for Autism before it was changed to ASD. (Please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong) 

My entire life my parents never told me, nor did they pursue it with the pediatrician or any of my doctors. I struggled all the way through school and barely graduated in normal classes when I should have been in special ed‚Ä¶it was brushed off as ADHD because my mom always did the talking at the doctors and I was only allowed to say what she coached me to say, and now I know why‚Ä¶I guess she just couldn‚Äôt accept the fact her son had a learning disability. 

*side note I grew up in a wealthy but abusive household as an adopted only child. 

I‚Äôm married now and still struggle everyday with the same things I always have but it is way different as an adult.
There is so much more to my story but too way much for Reddit, I‚Äôm also physically disabled as icing on the cake so I‚Äôve thought about starting an instagram or a YouTube channel to help spread awareness but I don‚Äôt know if it would catch on. If anyone has any advice on getting an official diagnosis and how to better understand and cope with this new discovery please let me know.

24,AutisticAdults,2023-05-26 02:31:22,Kmama,Advice from autistic adults for my teen - he lost his wireless headphones and broke his phone. How much responsibility should I expect him to take?,"My son, Max, is 14. he is autistic and has ADHD (inattentive type). He is a typical teenager in that he wants to fit in and be part of the crowd. He is also a typical teenager in that he is addicted to his phone. 
We gave him my old iPhone X at the start of the year so he could join in with other kids at school. We also gave him a pair of really good ($100) pair of wireless headphones. We spent more on the headphones because they have good noise cancelling, which he uses a fair bit when he is overwhelmed. He also uses the phone a lot to listen to music when he is out of his comfort zone. Otherwise it‚Äôs used for typical teen stuff - social media, watching YouTube, chatting with friends, etc.
Anyway, Max is not good with his possessions. He is always losing them and dropping them, treating them roughly etc. I think the word careless summarises it best.  He has had to replace or pay for repairs on a few of his items in the last three years. He saves up his birthday/Christmas money from us and his grandparents but doesn‚Äôt have a regular job. We keep offering to give him pocket money if he will do some jobs around the house, but he refuses (he says ‚ÄòI‚Äôm too lazy‚Äô.) I won‚Äôt let him get a job outside the house until he starts doing some jobs at home, as my belief is that if he has enough time and energy to earn his own money, he has enough time and energy to help at home first.
Anyway, in the last month, Max has lost his headphones at school somewhere (and they have now probably been taken by a less honest student), and this week he has dropped his phone and broken it. He doesn‚Äôt have enough money to replace/ repair them.
Part of me feels that he has to learn responsibility for his items, and needs to not be bailed out when he is being careless (things we have told him repeatedly, like don‚Äôt walk down the street on your phone, not looking where you are going, but he does it anyway). But part of me recognises his neurodivergence is affecting his ability to be careful with his items. I am ADHD myself, so I often lose my phone/headphones/ wallet etc. And I accept that it is part of my brain and wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to replace my own items, even if it was a stupid mistake on my part. I forgive myself for my neurodiversity.

I made a post in a chronically ill group about advice for staying hydrated as someone who hates water. 

I‚Äôm AuDHD and hydration has always been a struggle for me. I didn‚Äôt know it was strongly due to things like not getting hunger and thirst cues properly, things like executive dysfunction, other symptoms of AuDHD that just make care task so damn difficult to do. 

Most of the responses were great and I have tons of suggestions to consider. But one person started off their comment with ‚ÄúI hate to break it to you but part of being an adult is drinking water‚Äù. It felt patronizing, I have a lot of rejection feelings towards any kind of behavior people push as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. Because even tasks that are necessary, just because need to do them even for my health, it doesn‚Äôt make it easy. 

They also started pushing the whole ‚Äúsugar is bad‚Äù thing. And idk about anyone else, but as someone who got shoved into diet culture really young I struggle with disordered eating. And it‚Äôs important to pull away from this idea that some foods are good and some foods are bad. So I let them know this and asked them to just be more mindful, and I assumed they didn‚Äôt mean to be patronizing but it did come off that way. 

Things just escalated and it turned into them making fun of me for asking for advice but then not liking their advice. They said I was ‚Äúbitching‚Äù because I wouldn‚Äôt drink water but complained about not being hydrated. They then compared me to their mother who complains to them about their weight, to which they tell her not to eat sticks of butter, and then they added their mom is always offended by this. 

They claimed to be AuDHD as well and said it didn‚Äôt stop them from ‚Äútraining‚Äù themselves to drink water. 

Tbh the whole situation made me cry. I‚Äôm scared to even post here that I might be antagonized by others. As someone who struggles to build connections, I just always assumed spaces like this were easier and people were always more compassionate because they can understand. This person triggered all the things I fear about my AuDHD which is that it‚Äôs not disabling, I‚Äôm just lazy and don‚Äôt want to do the work.

I (20f) study nursing. I'm in my 3rd year (out of four) and we got the news today that our whole year will go from 3 to 2 classes. This meant that they mixed all the groups. Most friend groups were kept together and some were split (for example mine, we got split 2-2, when our teacher (who was involved in this) has subtly tried to split us up for 2 years now, we are good students fyi).

This made everyone fairly upset, because we will now have classes of 26 and 27 people, instead of 3 with 17/18. We got very different news 2 weeks ago (that our while class would have the senior year together after working towards it for 3 years together).

I am the class representative, and decided that next to the messy and high emotion debate there will be tomorrow, we should send an objective and respectful email stating what it has done to us.

Now this is where I messed up. Some of our current classmates currently do an internship abroad. I should have included them more in the process before sending it. 
I learned later that they stand very differently in this than us (they are more emotionally detached and more accepting of this outcome).
We had the idea that maybe 2 girls (abroad) would want to change with 2 of my friends. This way everyone would be reunited with their friends. We wrote it down and I included that as a solution in de mail, when the girls abroad hadn't agreed to that yet. I have apologised to them both multiple times and send another mail stating that the names named shouldn't have happened, because not everyone had said yes to this yet. 
The girls did say they didn't blame me, but next time to communicate to them first and that they hope this doesn't have any consequences. That made me feel alright but horrible.

Later I got more feedback that some others from abroad found it to emotional and had some comments about wording and points made. We called and everyone explained their side (them not finding this very nice towards the new potential classmates and me saying we purely wanted to express emotion in this and tell what it did to us about what and how it happened). They sounded okay with it, and I did apologise multiple times again that I should have included them more.

I am crying rn, because I should have waited longer to send it, even though a different teacher said it was nicely written and my whole class said to send it.

Everyone forgave me or said it was okay, but I'm still very disappointed in myself.
I'm so tired these days (I'm also overstimulated from having so much going on and really want to do everything right)

Was it not thinking your behaviours or impulses were repetitive enough/at all because you actively moderated/surpressed them through your life?

Curious what doubts you had to wrestle with before you ended up receiving essentially a confirmation from a professional. What helped you to overcome these doubts?

Yesterday I had barely slept and was the warmest day of the year so far, I chose the wrong clothes (too high neck and the cotton top was a bit too thick). The bus was too warm. Here I was already on thin ice. 

Got to uni and this alarm kept going off. We tried to have a seminar outside but it was loud, so we went inside again. I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable stimming too much and my nerves were fraught‚Ä¶

Bought lunch and the machine messed up my order‚Ä¶ twice. But eventually I got it right. Picked a book up at the library and then went to look for a book for my dad because his birthday is next week.

I was crying so much and I couldn‚Äôt stop. Everything felt out of control and I was panicking. There had been too much noise and there were too many people.

In the mean time, I‚Äôve found myself overanalyzing everything I do and think.

For whatever reason, whether I‚Äôm starting to unmask, notice my tendencies more, or I‚Äôm internalizing symptoms and signs of Autism, it seems like literally everything I do lines up with either common Autistic experiences or symptoms. The more I think on it, the more it feels like everything about me is caused by something, instead of just being who I am.

39,AutisticAdults,2023-05-25 18:01:13,Broad_Taro_Trapz,Not diagnosed with ASD but seems likely I have it and not sure what to do.,"Long story: I‚Äôm in my 40s, and my whole life I have felt different from others, like I don‚Äôt fit in. I have dealt with serious anxiety and mild depression since I was a child. I have been diagnosed with ADHD-c mostly off of extremely inconsistent school performance when I was a kid: if I found something interesting I could learn it easily and retain all the facts forever, but if something didn‚Äôt interest me I couldn‚Äôt  (and still struggle to) focus, I daydream constantly and looked for something that would interest or stimulate me. This involved destructivity and hyperactivity that would annoy my parents and teachers. I also had impulse control issues that nearly got me arrested several times that have gotten better but I still struggle to use any sort of social media appropriately. This all sounds like run of the mill ADHD, and ADHD meds help somewhat. 

But I have also always felt very uncomfortable in social situations, like I just don‚Äôt know how to act appropriately. My default were either over the top behavior that others found annoying (I learned to control that as an adult) or shutdown (in a corner by myself/fleeing). I can fake being normal for an hour or two but I hate it. So as an adult I don‚Äôt really socialize at all if I don‚Äôt have to and I really have no friends outside of my immediate family. I have 3 interests I am extremely obsessive about and I can‚Äôt imagine not being able to pursue them. I have a job that fits one of my interests and I am pretty good at it, but I try to find excuses to avoid socializing with
my coworkers. They are good people but it just feels awkward and stressful for me. 
I am also married with three kids, and my youngest and I are extremely similar. She was a really challenging child behaviorally since birth (just like I was) so we started seeing therapists and eventually a psychologist and at age 8 she was diagnosed with ASD without intellectual or language impairment. She is now 13 and the similarities between us are only more apparent now (with the main difference is she no longer has any violent outbursts that I continued to have until age 20).

My wife and other children are now convinced I have ASD either in addition to or instead of ADHD-C, and I suspect they are correct. 
My question for you all is do you think this is something worth pursuing with a psychiatrist? I realize it would be better for my family if I was less obsessed with my routine, and I do wish I had friends. I feel like I know how to make friends but what I have to do to make friends-hanging out, making small talk, planning things isn‚Äôt worth it. Basically the idea of changing the way I am and who I am at this point in my life is scary and I am resistant to it.

I‚Äôm NB afab and 28. I realized I was on the spectrum a few years ago but am only now starting to accept it. It‚Äôs so lonely. I know no other autistic ppl. I know that could potentially help but I‚Äôm so exhausted and depressed. Sorry it‚Äôs a long one, there‚Äôs a tldr below. 

It‚Äôs not that I can‚Äôt find joy in some interactions it‚Äôs that I have to wade through so much anxiety and confusion to hit upon enjoyment. It makes interacting feel scary and not worth it. I live alone and don‚Äôt work and leave the house on average once  a week (this has gotten more inconsistent) for groceries and to do laundry at my moms. My sister also lives there. I have no adult friends besides them and a new one (my first one that‚Äôs not family) I‚Äôve been solely texting because in person is too hard. Even with her I told her I had to take a break due to issues with isolation. 

I really love my mother and sister. I don‚Äôt know what I would do without them and their support. I like my new friend, she‚Äôs so kind and funny! But interactions always feel‚Ä¶well bad. 

I‚Äôm able to unmask at times with all of them but I usually end up feeling ashamed and confused about even being a person? Like hearing my voice can be nails on a chalkboard but I compulsively keep speaking and seeking reassurance (I also have OCD) then just spiral. I always cry around them and get ‚Äòexistential‚Äô as they may say. I‚Äôm just so depressed and confused about myself and life it‚Äôs all I can focus on. I think of it as an unstoppable overflowing. It has to come out and I‚Äôm powerless to stop it. I feel like I‚Äôm too much and not enough constantly. I feel like nobody knows me and my pain. I just want to fix it maybe but obviously talking doesn‚Äôt help. Makes it worse honestly but I can‚Äôt stop. 

I feel Infantilized often. Even though I know it‚Äôs not intentional and there‚Äôs no Ill will behind it, obviously it still hurts. As if I‚Äôm just a little baby who just doesn‚Äôt get how to be a person yet. But I feel I‚Äôve never known. 

With my new friend I struggle to feel I‚Äôm enjoying our friendship even though I know I like her and the things we talk about. My body just feels so tense when speaking with them and after interactions I pick them apart endlessly worrying I did something wrong. I always think I did something wrong and ppl just won‚Äôt tell me. Reading between the lines is exhausting. I‚Äôm struggling not to break it off out of fear and exhaustion. 

TLDR: It feels easier to isolate. I‚Äôm incredibly in my head all the time when alone and it‚Äôs hell but it feels like a ‚Äúhell you know‚Äù type of thing. It‚Äôs preferable to the strain of interaction. 

I feel like I never know what is expected of me!! I‚Äôm simply tolerated. I feel like I‚Äôm in a damn play and don‚Äôt know my lines. I know I‚Äôm loved but I don‚Äôt feel loved. That I‚Äôm a black hole and it just gets lost in me. I feel like nothing. Nobody. 

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm posting this for except desperation and a potential for advice. I feel so lost and lonely. If anyone has similar experiences please share.

 Even if I don't have autisim I know ""something is wrong with me"". A month feels like a long time so I would like to askin avance:
 Did some of you had to go to more than one specialist to been diagnose? 
In case that I am not in the spectre. Did someone know which diagnoses they maybe give me?

46,AutisticAdults,2023-05-25 15:48:57,SolyLunaX,"My male partner is suspected to be Autistic, but refuses to seek diagnosis/treatment. It‚Äôs taking a toll on our relationship.","My (39M) partner of 3 years is suspected to be autistic by our couples therapist that he hasn‚Äôt gone to in about a year but I still see. He shows many characteristics the biggest ones being a very negative reaction to intense emotions (especially mine) to the point that he literally physically runs away from me, and hypersensitive to any real or perceived criticism. ANY ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs impossible to have a conversation with him about anything negative even when I try as hard as I can to use all the communication tools I‚Äôve learned in therapy. He usually blows up and if the topic is specifically triggering he becomes verbally abusive. 

I (34F) am diagnosed ADHD and have my own triggers and issues, especially with rejection sensitivity which is the icing on the cake since he is minimally affectionate and while most days I know he loves me, it‚Äôs very difficult to actually see it. 

Anyway, I‚Äôve spoken to him several times about my concerns for him as well as for what it‚Äôs doing to us as a couple and he‚Äôs just not having it. He refuses to go to a psychiatrist or even back to therapy with me. When we first went to therapy it was going well until it started bringing up feelings for him he just could NOT handle. 

We‚Äôre both Latinos which adds another layer of stigma to mental health which plays a huge part in his reluctance, since any kind of neurodivergence is seen as ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù and ‚Äúlack of motivation‚Äù that can easily be fixed with faith and determination so that doesn‚Äôt help the situation at all. Not to mention it makes it nearly impossible for him to understand MY issues and MY meltdowns at all. I recognize he doesn‚Äôt have the tools yet to understand or manage it but it‚Äôs really hurting me. 

I know that inevitably if this doesn‚Äôt get any better I will need to walk away, but I would really like to find a solution. He was my best friend and has been my ideal partner in every way and I just don‚Äôt know how to move forward from here. I know if he doesn‚Äôt want to help himself there‚Äôs not much I can do and that it‚Äôs not my responsibility to do so, but I would really like to find a way. 

Has anyone been effective at getting a loved one to treatment? If it was you, how would you want your partner to approach it? Any other advice for me that would also help preserve my own mental health?

I don't get people, I try but I don't understand how they're minds work and used to try to fit in but never did. I had some trauma in my early 20s that made me stop trying and since then I have lived alone with very little social communication. I find people scary I will avoid them irl because I'm scared of offending them and it turning confrontational, in that instance I will either lock up like my operating system crashed or just loose the ability to think straight making me talk loud/erratic.


I started painting models a couple of years ago and felt I did a ok job for a beginner but had nobody (friends or family) to ask if I was being bias over my own work, so I joined reddit. I posted my work and the response I had was overwhelming, I had never had positive reinforcement like that from anyone but my own mother, I literally cried with joy (it still makes me overwhelmed to think of it).

It was through my new found hobby and the kind people of reddit I eventually started to open up to people, I was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder in my early 30s and joined so I joined a reddit sub for social anxiety. It was in that sub someone surgested I may have undiagnosed Autism and suggested I took some online test.

I took those test and scored very high on them suggesting a high possibility I have some form of Autism. Since I did them (a couple of months ago) I have spent every day obsessing over what Autism is and reading/watching/listening to any information I can get.

I come to the point where I need to go see a doctor and ask for a referral to a specialist but I don't want to waste the time of a already overwelmed NHS. What if I'm not Autistic and I am just the broken thing I have accepted myself to be. I should imagen the assessment process is expensive and I don't want to waste resources on me that could help somebody in more need.

I'm sorry if I offended anyone with anything I said in this post, that was not my intention so please forgive me if I did. I have never been good at social communication.

My special interests are psychology and religion, so naturally I'm very interested in the many places where the two meet. I've recently stumbled across this idea that a large part of what motivates people to participate in religious group activity and attaches them so strongly to their particular tradition is this seeking after and enjoyment of collective effervescence (a phenomenon where individuals in groups can begin to feel and act as a group rather than individuals). I've read that people seek after this experience instinctively to develop and strengthen social bonds. This has been posited as a possible explanation for group religious experiences of connectedness with a god or gods, the holy spirit, etc. It also is thought to be part of why people in modern times enjoy group activities such as sporting events and concerts, which have shared mechanics and psychological effects with religious group activities.

The kicker is, I hate this feeling! I've experienced collective effervescence and it felt like my brain was hijacked by a stranger. I also don't care for concerts or sporting events, but I always assumed it was because of the overwhelming stimuli. Now I wonder if it also is due to my avoidance of this phenomenon. Also, despite religion being a special interest, I am not religious. I've tried to participate in multiple religions and join multiple religious groups due to my high interest in religion, but none of them ever fit for me. I'm curious if this is an autism thing, but I can't find any data online, anecdotal or otherwise, about autistic or even other neurodivergent opinions/experiences related to collective effervescence.

One of my favorites is 90 Day Fianc√© and all of its spin-offs, so naturally, when Match Me Abroad came out on TLC, I hit play. 

The basis of the show is that individuals who are interested in dating abroad hire matchmakers and go out on arranged dates. 

One of the (adult) men, who is autistic and openly identified as so on the show, has HIRED one of these matchmakers who is horribly, horribly ableist and infantilizing toward him.

64,AutisticAdults,2023-05-24 17:36:21,The_Teacat,Has anyone's family ever used a meltdown against you and/or lie to others about what actually happened?,"I've never talked about this one but it's happened a few times with mine, who are very conservative people who don't really believe in special treatment for things like this, and believe that if you're not on their side, you have to be Stockholmed until you are. Any sense of self or personal identity is not quite allowed and will be used against you unless it serves them. I'm still recovering from a lot of it and it's impossible to predict how much unwiring I already have to do, but I tend to be their scapegoat since I fight against it as much as I can.

But yes. I know there's nothing ""wrong"" with me, but they like to manipulate certain reactions out of me so they can demonize me even more. Specifically they've done this with meltdowns and my attachment to sentimental objects about as long as I can remember, seemingly just because they can. It's set me back a *lot* and left me with trust issues as well as anxious and depressive issues I don't like acknowledging since I'm concerned that gives them a ""win"", and I don't like admitting they can have that affect on me. (And it gives them more ways to toy with me and overpower me.)

This happened as recently as a few years ago, during an event where I was having a small, personal crisis over a financial issue. I wasn‚Äôt very comfortable around my family at the time and was going non-verbal while processing it, but the main culprit kept stalking me around and trying to force an answer out of me. It ended up not well; I ended up screaming at him to leave me alone as I kept having to retreat further and further to try and find privacy since I was so upset and embarrassed, and all he would do was follow me and? Act like there was anything he could do?

I ended up getting cut a few times trying to get away and was in the process of dealing with that as well and he still wouldn't leave me alone and that just pushed me further. And some windows were broken and he lied to the police about what was happening to make him seem more sympathetic, and none of my family understands what was actually happening and how unsafe and in-danger and just plain upset I felt; when all I needed was some privacy to get my center back and process some shitty feelings. They just demonize me for it now and barely even talk to me; all I wanted was to be left alone during an obvious meltdown? A deeply embarrassing, frustrating moment that their forced involvement kept exacerbating?

I've been dissociating a lot since then, because it's hard to feel safe showing any emotion or vulnerability around them knowing what they might do. I have a very hard time feeling confident in myself, telling stories about things that have happened, and taking responsibility for things due to everything that's happened to me in situations like this. Am I the problem here? These are the people who used to hit me just for being upset with me, punish me for being upset about things, and scold me for basic emotions without understanding why I was so frustrated, and never really helped me in a way that didn't serve them too, so obviously it's difficult for me to feel comfortable showing these things around them, and it's easier to shut down, but it's obvious they can still exacerbate meltdowns when they need to use them against me.

Has anyone else's family done this or been like this? How do you feel safe when they know they can use basic aspects of your brain's wiring like this and when you know they're against you anyway? I've been trying to leave for a long time and they just keep finding ways to remove that ability from me and attempts to infantilize me to keep me further held back and control me/take advantage of me even further. It's not so fun and feels super not nice actually speaking, you know?

My husband and I have had a rollercoaster of a relationship as far as highs and lows, and not being able to properly communicate our issues and be in sync. I‚Äôve recently started questioning if my husband is on the spectrum after a friend of mine was recently just diagnosed and had a revelation that a lot of his life struggles could have been better managed better had he known sooner, and it made me realize that my husband has a lot of those similar qualities. Once I realized this might be a possibility it was like this lightbulb when off and I started wondering if a lot of things I was getting frustrated with were because of the possibility of his ASD, and it made me see him in a new light (and even has made me pause before getting frustrated with him after realizing maybe he can‚Äôt help certain things). 

Here is my list of things that have made me question this:
- He doesn‚Äôt make a lot of eye contact with me, and when I‚Äôm telling him a story I often find myself saying ‚ÄúAre you listening?‚Äù And he snaps back ‚ÄúYes I‚Äôm listening!?‚Äù 
- He gets a lot of anxiety when going to a new place, and always asks where we will be parking when we get there and is anxious the entire drive 
- He doesn‚Äôt like when plans are ‚Äúsprung‚Äù on him, and it makes him mad and have caused several fights between us if my family invites us over ‚Äúlast minute‚Äù (aka a couple days away). 
- He always questions everyone‚Äôs motives and constantly thinks everyone is against him or is talking behind his back, even when they are not.  
- He goes through phases and obsessions over things, and it completely takes over his mind. For example: for months he played the same video game for hours and hours every day, then for months and months he obsessively watched YouTube videos about skateboards every night, then for a year or two he obsessively got involved in the QAnon cult movement online (it almost ended our marriage because it was affecting me and our kids). 
- He gives ‚Äúsqueeze hugs‚Äù where instead of gently hugging me sometimes he‚Äôll squeeze me so hard that it hurts and I have to tell him to stop 
- He uses the same phrases in conversation constantly. 
- He doesn‚Äôt like anybody (even me when I‚Äôm just cleaning our house) touching his things, and gets very angry if he can‚Äôt find something of his. 
- (This one has caused a TON of emotional conversations and arguments between us) He doesn‚Äôt seem to understand how to comfort me when I‚Äôm upset, or even show any care when I‚Äôm sitting in front of him crying about something. He stares blankly at me or just says ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok.‚Äù in a monotone manner. And when I say ‚ÄúI feel like you don‚Äôt even care about me or care when I‚Äôm upset‚Äù he always acts really confused and says ‚ÄúYou know that‚Äôs not true? I love you‚Äù.

69,AutisticAdults,2023-05-24 15:34:59,idkijustlovemydog,I'm so sick of my supposed friends. I bought tickets to a concert for three of us in advance. No one even mentioned paying me back until I brought it up. And still haven't been paid back. Plus so much more in post,"There was a concert that was gonna sell out fast (my friends love the artist and so do i). I tell my friends about the concert and we're all excited. We hang out and they agree to pay me back so I buy 3 tickets while we're hanging out. Total, they were $300. 

When it comes close to concert time, I arrive to my friend's house on time. I checked a million times and the concert started at 7. My other friend doesn't even arrive until 8:30.

We finally get to the concert at 9:00 and it's over by the time we get there. My friends really didn't care at all. Because they had no intention at all of ever paying me back for those tickets...

The money itself isn't what bothers me, it's the principle. I shouldn't have to remind someone to pay me back for a $100 ticket. I reminded them a few times, but I shouldn't have to beg to be paid back. Let alone 2 fucking people. These two people are always acting entitled to my belongings. Whether it be money, my time, food, rides, mental space, literally anything. And I'm so fucking sick of being disrespected.

The thing is tho.....it feels like everyone eventually starts to treat me like this. If I want friends, it seems like I have to settle for people that will be ""the least"" rude to me if that makes sense. I am so sick of it. I don't want to become bitter but it's hard. 

Sorry for the vent, I just really needed somewhere to post this. The way I'm feeling right now, I never want to see these people ever again. But I know I will....

I'm terrible at talking to people, but I'm wondering what some of you would say to these ""friends"" if this happened to you. I need some help formulating what I should say to them. 

 I only ever really reminded them twice to pay me back but I feel that's enough. I shouldn't have to call out everything they do to earn respect. They know damn well what they're doing and they're just taking advantage of me and don't care.

The problem is - or the problems are - my psychiatrist doesn't want to refer me to anyone who can diagnose autism since I already have the BPD diagnosis.

78,AutisticAdults,2023-05-24 03:59:32,Naima92231,"At 61, It Occurs to Me That I'm Probably On the Autism Spectrum.","Last year I reconnected with a man I met in my late-20's (he's 6 years older), whom I considered a (very attractive) friend. I've know and cared about over the decades, but I got married, moved, had a wonderful son (now 24), eventually separated 
/divorced and move to another state with him, just to get away fro my ex.

But eventually I moved back (with my son) to the town I love the most, where my old friend still lives. He's 67, and I'm 61.

When we re-connected, he shortly thereafter went into the throes of some serious health complications. He'd lost a lot of weight and basically couldn't get up from his living-room floor to even feed himself, and was skeletal. So I brought him to my place for a while, where I could keep him fed, get him to doctors' appts., etc.

He continued to stay with me (or I'd stay at his place) after he got better. We were very affectionate with each other, but it was always platonic (not my idea--I'm seriously attracted to him, but I'm
not sure he understands why!).

Over time, he's become less physically affectionate (we've never even kissed). I don't mind (TOO much) not having sex, but we still sleep together sometimes and he's much less cuddly (not always, but more distant). I really miss that.

But he's warm and funny and talented and delightfully quirky. I love him as my best friend, but it's hard.

Anyway, a few months ago it dawned on me that he might be a very smart, high-functioning person on the spectrum. I slowly introduced the possibility to him--especially his sensory issues (I didn't question him much about sexuality), and a few other things. He seemed interested, and not insulted, by the possibility. We watched ""Rain Man,"", and now we're both always quoting from it.

I often tell him that, even when he makes no sense, he makes more sense to me than anyone. I trust him (not a common thing with me!), and I love him--I'm just not sure as WHAT, but that's pretty much okay. Well, sometimes it's been painful, but he knows that, and he's always kind and sweet (if a little hyper-critical sometimes). We tend to be there for each other, and he's obviously put effort into thinking about how I feel and adjusting how he responds.

I enjoy spending time with him more than anyone in years (aside from my soon, but that's different, of corse!).

I think that he and I tacitly agree that he's an ""aspie"" (I know that word's not used much any more), and, as I've learned more about it for his sake, I'm starting to believe (at 61!) that maybe I've been on the spectrum my whole life as well. For a long time I've thought that I have (and now get medicated for) ADD, but when I think back over my life and interactions I wonder..

I've taken a few online autism tests, with varying results, but today I took the AQ test and tested 33 out of 50! The questions can be so vague and difficult to answer, but I assume that's the way the tests are designed.

So, I guess, what next? I've never particularly trusted therapists. I just think back over my 6 decades, and how badly things often turned out at jobs, etc., and I guess I'd just like to understand. I know there's no magic pill for it, and I guess I'll always be this way.

But I've always carried a lot of shame and a lot of ""not quite fitting in,"" and I wonder if I can somehow reconcile all that, or if I can.

How did nobody know? Probably for the same reason they never knew I had ADHD‚Ä¶ my parents are almost certainly neurodivergent.

And now I‚Äôm nearly 40 and I don‚Äôt have the right tools for the job and I‚Äôm an alien who can‚Äôt find her way back to her home planet.

94,AutisticAdults,2023-05-23 18:02:05,motanz,More gullible than I‚Äôd like to think,"Last week I had a technician check my washing machine and I wanted it to be fixed asap. So, he talked me into accepting the full service and everything looked legit. They had me sign some papers and they left with half the money ($200 USD). They came back the day after and ‚Äúfixed‚Äù it, I paid them another $200 + tip. Two hours later, the washing machine wasn‚Äôt working anymore.

I immediately called them and they told me not to worry, they would come back the day after. That was last Wednesday and they haven‚Äôt. Every time I call them they give me a bs excuse and promise me they‚Äôll come soon.

Mind you, I‚Äôm not from the US, things like this are a little more informal in my country, so it‚Äôs not necessarily strange to pay people upfront and just trust they will complete the service, normally there are no problems.

But, I‚Äôm feeling iffy about this and I‚Äôm now assuming I‚Äôve been scammed for $400 USD. I‚Äôm researching my legal options, but knowing my country‚Äôs justice system, I don‚Äôt have a lot of hope.

This is not the first time something like this happens to me (fortunately not as expensive), but I‚Äôm constantly in situations where people just take advantage of me and I don‚Äôt notice until later or when someone else tells me what happened.

It makes me so frustrated, since I‚Äôm 33 and whenever I try to do adult things, I always mess them up.

Sorry for the rant, and sorry if this is not appropriate for this sub, but I feel like this is part of my autistic experience and I wanted to share to see if someone can relate or give me some words of advice.

100,AutisticAdults,2023-05-23 06:53:31,Valgrimm93,Identifying triggers for Late Diagnosed/Self-diagnosed Adults,"\*Cross Post\*

 I found out about 8 weeks ago I am likely autistic and have been in burnout essentially ever since. I have noticed that when I am at almost zero energy and am in a safe space, I am often numb and don't feel a whole lot of anxiety or much else. When I do something to recharge some energy however, like go for a walk in a park or partake in my interests (primarily PC gaming), I actually will gain some ambient anxiety to feed off my newly gained energy even when otherwise completely comfortable. For example I was playing a game much of today and felt fine, but as soon as I logged out, I was hit my immediate low grade anxiety, which has been sticking with me ever since.

My guesses as to what might be causing this is:

1. Anticipation of my intake screening appointment with a therapist specializing in autism in about a week, to determine if I should move forward with adult diagnosis. I am feeling fairly sure in my self assessment, especially since hitting burnout and figuring out what was happening, but am frequently imagining what I will say in the appointment even though I really have no idea yet on the format.
2. Stimming. Now that I am aware of my stimming, including some (realistically many) I didn't even know I was doing before I started watching for them, I feel like I perhaps have more conscious control of whether I do them or not. I feel like I am actually doing things I did subconsciously all the time before (rhythmically twitching my fingers, shaking my hands, etc) less since I am more aware of doing them and just don't. I do literally feel a compulsion to do some things when I am not though. Do those aware of their stimming have to do so more consciously?
3. Some unknown irritant I haven't identified yet.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to how to identify what is bothering you when you are having obvious stress from somewhere in a place that otherwise seems safe and relatively trigger free? I am just wondering if anyone has any suggestions for identifying triggers, or if could be due to lack of conscious stimming (or accidental conscious suppression of stimming). Thanks in advance for any suggestions.",8,6,6,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13pgp0x')>,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/13pgp0x/identifying_triggers_for_late/,False
