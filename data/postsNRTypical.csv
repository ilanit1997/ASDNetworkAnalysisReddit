1,depression,2023-05-27 10:58:24,LostCookie29,Thinking of cutting everyone off,"I (25F) recently made a huge sacrifice for my family members. Leaving my bf behind. Leaving not so comfortable but less toxic life just to follow what my parents say. Now I regret doing that.

I'm thinking of breaking up to cut connections with him and stop hurting him. LDR has been hard on us. Maybe I want me to stop hurting.

After breaking up, I'll leave this house and run away to a different state alone and build my life from there even from nothing. Hell, I might even be homeless then but for last I can live the life that I own.",0,1,1,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13t4dgg')>,/r/depression/comments/13t4dgg/thinking_of_cutting_everyone_off/,False
2,depression,2023-05-27 10:51:16,VanaVisera,(F27) I Feel Like A Complete Failure,"I’m a 27 year old goth woman who feels like all of my suffering has been for nothing and I don’t want to live to see 30. 

People look at me and they see a “pretty”girl and assume that I have a lot of friends and things going for me. But the truth is…is that I have no friends and no romantic relationships. And I struggle to connect with other people because of my mental health issues.

This is going to be a brutally honest post, just warning you If you are easily triggered. It’s very possible I will likely delete this post eventually because it’s perhaps too honest and revealing.

As I child, I had many learning disabilities. My parents hired a tutor who was an older man to help me at school. When I was 9 or 10 years old, I was raped by him. He eventually killed himself years later. I didn’t even know how to process what happened and it didn’t start to effect me until I got older. 

I have struggled with severe depression consistently since I was 15. When in the summer of 2011, my Grandmother who I loved very much, passed away. My girlfriend at the time broke up with me and my older cousin whom I loved since childhood like an older brother stopped talking to me after he went to college.

Since then, going into my twenties…I have had friends, boyfriends, girlfriends, jobs, etc. But nothing ever sticks. Everyone goes away in the end. Every job I have, I quit. I’m not good at anything and so it’s hard for me to find joy in working. I’m a college dropout despite being academically intelligent. But even so, I feel like a complete failure.

In terms of friendships, I always seem to befriend the wrong people. Most of my friends never actually cared about me. They were all drug addicts and drug taxers. I’ve had “friends” steal from me, lie to me and generally I always get abandoned or ghosted eventually. This has caused me to develop severe trust and abandonment issues. Also those “friends” actually got me hooked on drugs and alcohol for several years.

When it comes to romantic relationships, I’m bisexual and have had success in having some long term relationships. However I’ve cheated on almost everyone I’ve ever been with. I don’t know why, likely the fear of being vulnerable. The fear of being abandoned. But every time I’ve done it. I tell the person immediately after and break things off. Because I have a massive guilty conscience and hate lying to people.

I have also physically abused some of the people I’ve dated (grabbing them by the shirt or chest, pushing them. I’ve never punched them or anything like that). It’s like I have two personalities…I can be kind, empathetic, gentle, supportive, well adjusted. But I have a horrible temper and a compulsion to destroy things. When people make me angry everything becomes a blur. Only for me to just “snap” out of it. I’m either a kind hearted gentle person or an extremely violently angry person. It’s like there’s no in between.

When I’m angry, I lash out to an extreme length. I’ve thrown things at walls and yell so loudly that many of my partners are genuinely terrified of me in the moment. Almost two years ago, I got into a horrible fight with my now ex fiancé. It’s somewhat difficult to explain but I pushed him, he fell back and as he did; one of my fingernails scratched the top of his forehead. For weeks afterwards he had a large scratch on his head. The guilt of that killed me on the inside and it still does.

Two years later, out of emotionally crippling guilt I got back into contact with my exes that I have physically and verbally abused. To just have some form of closure and again sincerely apologize for the bad things I’ve done. To my amazement and disbelief, they all forgave me. They all genuinely don’t think I’m a bad person and they think that my explosive temper is some sort of trauma response. However I feel that I don’t deserve their forgiveness. 

I began to realize that self harming stopped my explosive temper. If I lash out at myself first, I can’t lash out at other people. So I cut my left arm almost every night with a razor blade because it snaps me out of my negative state without hurting other people.

Since I am on the topic of romantic relationships, my sex life has been nonexistent. It’s actually incredibly difficult for me to have sex. It takes me a very long time to even be comfortable with somebody before I have sex with him. And it’s incredibly common for me to start having a panic attack just before having sex. I hyperventilate and start shaking violently. 

And what’s even worse is that I’ve never have dated or been with anybody that has ever comforted me during one of these episodes. I just have to get over it myself and wait it out. More often than not my romantic partner(s) are annoyed by it instead of empathizing with me. Which has really affected my self-esteem and sexual confidence 

Last year I was also involved in a horrible car accident and was nearly killed. I almost died from blood loss that was due to an injury on my left arm. And yes when I cut myself, I do cut my left arm with the razor blade specifically because it reminds me of the car accident. I’m not sure why I do that but I do.

The accident was quite traumatic for me and I don’t think I’ve ever been the same since it happened. I don’t feel like the same person anymore and my mental health issues got significantly worse since it happened to me.

The fact that my exes have forgiven me gives me the tiniest amount of hope that maybe I am a good person and there is some sort of redeemable quality in me. I feel like a horrible failure of a person that’s failed in every aspect of their life. And I don’t blame anyone reading this for hating me as well.

And yes while I have gone through some trauma that’s no excuse for my poor behavior in the past. I don’t think I will ever be able to forgive myself and honestly I think I deserve my suffering. I often think about suicide because I think that’s what I deserve. I don’t see any other way out. I’ve gone to therapy for 10 years, I’ve been on every anti-depressant and antipsychotic medication on the market. I just don’t know what else to do.


Honestly, why would anybody want to be my friend? Why would anybody want to have me as a girlfriend or wife? When you’ve done the things that I have done and have experienced the things that I have experienced. How can I ever be honest with somebody without being terrified of them hurting or leaving me?",0,2,2,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13t497j')>,/r/depression/comments/13t497j/f27_i_feel_like_a_complete_failure/,True

5,depression,2023-05-27 09:59:08,Last_Temperature_55,I quick my antidepressants cold turkey and now regretting it.,I quit taking my antidepressants just a couple days ago going full cold turkey. I was on 75mg of Effexor which didn’t do much and also found out I my parents didn’t want to pay for healthcare. I’m a 20 year old women so I was able to be on it for another 5 years. Upon finding this out this means no more therapy because it was going to be $67 out of pocket and another $70 for the meds. Money is tight so I decided to go cold turkey with the help of some “trees” So far it’s been pretty hellish going through withdraw but I’m wondering what I did was wrong and if maybe paying the extra $300 (i use to go to therapy twice a month) was worth going through the withdrawal. I really didn’t want to have to depend on the meds so much but things were getting mentally tough at the beginning of this year. I haven’t been able to talk to anyone about this who really can give much feedback because my parents think taking medication is bs anyway and my bf offered to pay for it but we really don’t have the money for it (plus getting healthcare in my state is nearly impossible unless you have kids) I know he just wants what’s best for me but I really want to get off this stuff and be able to sort things out with out the meds. If I do feel like I’m going to hurt myself or feel bad I will go back to the therapy and meds. Just right now I don’t think I’m able to with my current situation. In all honesty I feel pretty fine and things have been pretty normal with me. I’m just not sure if what I did was the smart decision but I’m already going on my 3rd day without taking my meds.,0,1,1,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13t3e2x')>,/r/depression/comments/13t3e2x/i_quick_my_antidepressants_cold_turkey_and_now/,False

I asked the doc and he said you’ll be fine after a few weeks of stopping the meds but he’s just not letting get off them.

8,depression,2023-05-27 09:46:39,ThrwawyNoLove,my best friend is getting married and I feel so insecure,"We‘re both in our late twenties and marriage is huge in my culture. Her bf converted for her and they‘ve been together for a few years now.



I feel like she has her life more together than me. I always was a person that needs more time for everything and I struggled a lot in life - like a lot of mental health issues, a family on my mom’s side that was very dysfunctional to the point it even affected us sometimes due to my mom being traumatized by them, struggling in school/university/relationships… 


I‘m also in the process of getting diagnosed for ADHD (inattentive type) because up until 2020 I was an even huger mess. I was able to finish university and get a job, but ever since then I felt so empty. I also had a lot of sexual abuse trauma in my life. Because of the last encounter, I didn‘t have a partner in 7 years, because my self esteem is so low. Despite 5 years of therapy (3 different types), a psychiatric daily clinic stay, medication etc. I never got over it fully. I was diagnosed with Avoidant personality disorder at age 22.


Now that my friend is marrying soon, I‘m reminded once again how much I don‘t live up to anyone. I‘ll get asked why I haven‘t married yet.


I can‘t tell anyone it‘s because I think I‘m too ugly and unworthy for that. I can’t tell anyone the aspect of someone touching me or seeing me in vulnerable moments makes me nauseous. I only told my therapist about it but my therapy ended in 2022… It‘s embarrassing and pathetic. I truly believe it though. I‘ve completly shut myself off. I‘ve felt disconnected from my feelings for the past year now.


Work keeps me busy but I‘m so bad at doing stuff by myself. Organizing things, managing money etc. is so hard for me. It takes too much energy… If it was up to me, I‘d just want to live on a small farm or small forest house, have some animals and live a life without anyone. 


I tell people I‘m not interested in a relationship and honestly 90% of the time I‘m not. I feel too overwhelmed with my daily life to care about another person and most people around me are very superficial regarding looks. But the fact that I‘m the only single friend in my entire circle makes me so self concious… It makes me feel inadequate


Anything I achieved seems irrelevant. It doesn‘t matter that I struggled through university yet still graduated, I think it‘s worthless and anyone can do it.

Some people know some things and others don’t see much at all, but I can truly say nobody really has a clear view of how my life currently is. I have had severe depression for years now and for the vast majority of it I have been on medication. I can’t explain why but my for a lot of my life I have been lying about so much about so many things simply to have others either not worry about me or not think down of me. This can range from stuff when I was a teenager in school to present day in my adult life. The major way I have been coping with my depression recently is use of alcohol and marijuana. It usually comes in spikes (?) where I drink/smoke heavily for a couple days. I think really the only reason why I stop is because after a few days my body hurts far too much. For a few months now I have stop taking my medication completely and seeing my psychiatrist/therapist. Full on ghosted them. The reality of why I did this is I have put myself into debt through these habits and at the time I chose to use my income for more self destructive habits than actual treatment. I knew then it was a horrible decision and I still understand that now. The more I reflect on the hole I have dug for myself in the last couple of years the more I realize how monstrously hard this will be to get myself out of. I want to work on paying my debts and receive some sort of therapy again. Paying for everything that I need to will take several months as I do not work a great job by any means. I absolutely can’t ask anyone for help with this because I can’t do that to them. I would feel horrible. To me it’s so much easier to get shitfaced drunk just for those moments where I don’t feel horrible about what I have been doing to my life.

16,Anxiety,2023-05-27 11:00:20,ToyLollipop,Anxiety ruins the relationship with my family (thoughts of suicide),"Yesterday, we had to celebrate children's day earlier. I decided to come at the place where it celebrated together with my mom. We arrived and I saw lots of children and teens there. It was a stadium where the celebration had place. I wanted to come there because maybe I could meet someone, but apparently, I wasn't prepared. There was someone who invited me to stay next to them. I did, but I never talked because I feared to say something stupid. My mom eventually called me and told me there were some exclassmates I could go and talk to. I couldn't find them. I was too afraid to see someone that I could accidentally make eye contact. I saw lots of people I know having fun and I had the feeling that I didn't know what to do. I only wanted to crouch and cry. (I know that people don't have any problems with me, but I can't stop the thoughts of people who look at me and call me a loser or a weirdo. I always think that every move I do will lead to harsh concequences. I shouldn't view life like that, yet I hate myself for not stopping. It was my fault for being a crybaby and acting jealous at school anyway. No one thought of me as a great person because of that, and so I tried to perfect myself as much as possible, and I still think I'm not enough.)

My mom saw me do that. Usually when I have panick attacks, my mom would try to confort me, but that time she got angry, took my arm and forced me to go home. She would tell me all the time we were walking home about the fact that she is tired of waiting for me to finally open up, to talk to people. She is tired to see me stay quiet. She saw me staying with that girl and told me ""she invited you to stay and talk to her, yet you didn't say anything like a stupid bitch"", telling me that I need to go to a psychiatrist (to be honest, I wouldn't mind that, but of course she won't take me to one because she thinks I don't actually need one). One thing that made me feel like killing myself is that she bans me from talking to a friend of mine, who I have a lot in common with because ""you literally sold your soul for that friendship and you wouldn't talk to anyone else."" I think of it as a hypocritical move because she was the one who recommended me to talk to the person in the first place.

I thought that my mom has changed because she finally observed that I suffer. I guess I was mistaken. She wouldn't listen to me anymore. When my dad heard of this, he got pissed on my mom and reminded her of my heart condition and that her behaviour leads us to nothing. He then accused her for breaking my arm (which it wasn't even broken). Later, my dad asked me about what happened after we left from the stadium. Then he told me that my behaviour is mainly influenced of my internet activity, that he'll throw away my gadgets. I was always afraid that they will probably end up divorcing because of me. My mom told me several years ago that they mostly fight because of me.

I am afraid of becoming any of my parents. I don't want to become like my mother because of her manipulative tendencies (that I recently discovered) and I don't want to become like my dad, who's overly protective. At this point I don't know if I should kill myself or not because I've got no one. Yet I'm too afraid of death. I can't even get proper help. Maybe when I'll finally have my own life, things will get better.

What I mean is, for example, I work at a music venue. A huge, very long music venue. It takes about 10 minutes to walk from one side to the other. If I'm leading my crew to do a job, or taking a group of new hires to do some training and I am in front of the group, it feels like I have forgotten how to walk. My right leg feels paralyzed while my left leg goes completely loose and feels like it's flopping around. I don't know what to do with my hands and arms even if I'm holding something, so they normally stay stiffly at my side while I try to move them occasionally on purpose. I also don't know where to look while I'm walking, so I'm either awkwardly staring at the ground so much that I go off course or run into something, or just awkwardly darting my head around to stare at random objects until I feel like I don't look weird anymore.

I've experienced this for years but I have finally realized how exhausting this is and am wondering if anyone has any tips or tricks to soothe this when it happens. I have a 12 person crew of completely new employees at a sold out concert tonight and I have to walk all of them around to introduce them and answer questions and I just know I'm going to make myself look like a weirdo.

I started a new construction job this week, it is in a remote area and for a good company. In this industry due to high risk nature of work we are subjected to random drug and alcohol tests to make sure we are fit for the dangerous environment.

I started on the same day as another guy who is the same age as me. We are discussing the random drug and alcohol tests. 

I mentioned that in my previous company I failed a drug and alcohol test. I tested positive for cannabis after smoking a couple of joints on my birthday and getting tested when I returned to site. 

I told him I regret it massively and don't smoke any more as a result. 

That seemed fine, we continued talking about drugs and drug experiences.  He mentioned that he sometimes enjoys cocaine sparingly.

I told him I no longer take any stimulants after being sold Crystal Meth when I tried to purchase MD. This seemed fine at the time as well, he asked what it was like, if I stayed up for days etc.

However since then (three days ago) he is acting much more distant with me. We were forced to ride together in the car today and he started complaining about people failing drug tests and telling crazy stories in the work place.

I was taken aback, I thought my stories were appropriate given the topic of discussion was drugs and he mentioned doing cocaine. I told them in the spirit of being honest about who I am and my experiences in life.

I got the vibe he is trying to bring me down, as if he thought I'd done something terribly wrong and he knows better about how to behave around a construction site.

But before that one of our blockmates who is also a part of their group approached my seatmate bcoz their friends he went behind me i didnt pay him any attention tho coz i never liked him I knew he was mean from the start and likes to make jokes insulting other ppl just for their definition of fun. And the other guy whispered that im their i heard and he said ew and that he would kick me i believe he was trying to seem discreet but not really in a way for me to hear?!

Im just a quiet student who mind's his own business and i dont like talking to anybody because i have this fear that they think of me as weird and already judging me.

28,Anxiety,2023-05-27 08:55:57,digital_2020,"Propranolol, anxiety and reconsolidation of the memories","So, recently, I became aware that there are some recent research and innovative applications of propranolol regarding the healing of PTSD/Anxiety symptoms.
  

  
I have read some research materials, and it appears that the main mechanism of healing is achieved by taking propranolol approximately one hour before retrieving a disturbing memory. It is believed that during the active period of the medication, the emotional response associated with the memory is either removed or reduced when the memory is reconsolidated.
  

  
Does anyone have any experience with this? What are your thoughts on whether this could be a viable approach to healing?
  

  
Thanks in advance!
  

  
PS: Also I'm also adding ChatGPT response below on this matter:
  

  
**How propranolol can be used to heal ptsd and heal negative emotional response from memories?**
  

  
*Propranolol is a medication primarily used to treat conditions such as high blood pressure, angina (chest pain), and certain heart rhythm disorders. While it is not approved by regulatory authorities as a specific treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), some studies have explored its potential use in reducing the emotional intensity associated with traumatic memories.*
  

  
*The concept behind using propranolol for PTSD is based on the idea that the drug may interfere with the process of memory reconsolidation, which is the stabilization and re-storage of memories when they are recalled. By administering propranolol shortly after a traumatic event or during the recollection of traumatic memories, the hope is that it may disrupt the emotional response associated with those memories, potentially reducing the intensity of PTSD symptoms.*
  

  
*It's important to note that the use of propranolol for PTSD is still a subject of ongoing research, and its efficacy and safety for this purpose are not yet fully established. The results from studies have been mixed, and more research is needed to determine its long-term effects, optimal dosing, and potential benefits and risks.*
  

  
**What might be the mechanism of propranolol healing effect with regard to memory reconsolidation**
  

  
*The exact mechanism by which propranolol may affect memory reconsolidation is not fully understood. However, there are a few proposed theories regarding its potential healing effects on traumatic memories and emotional responses:*
  

  
*Noradrenergic modulation: Propranolol is a beta-blocker that primarily acts by blocking beta-adrenergic receptors. One theory suggests that traumatic memories and their associated emotional responses involve heightened activity in the noradrenergic system, which is involved in the stress response. By blocking beta-adrenergic receptors, propranolol may reduce the release of norepinephrine, a stress hormone, and thereby interfere with the emotional consolidation of traumatic memories.*
  

  
*Disruption of memory reconsolidation: When memories are recalled, they enter a labile state known as reconsolidation, during which they are susceptible to modification or disruption. Propranolol, when administered around the time of memory retrieval, may interfere with the reconsolidation process, weakening the emotional intensity associated with the memory. This disruption may lead to a reduction in the negative emotional response to the memory over time.*
  

  
*Contextual memory impairment: Another proposed mechanism is that propranolol may impair the contextual memory associated with traumatic events. Contextual memory refers to the details and environmental cues associated with a particular memory. By disrupting the contextual memory, propranolol may weaken the emotional response tied to the traumatic event.*
  

  
*It's important to note that while these theories provide possible explanations for the effects of propranolol on memory reconsolidation, further research is needed to fully understand its mechanisms and confirm its effectiveness in treating PTSD or reducing the emotional impact of traumatic memories.*",0,1,1,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13t2d3c')>,/r/Anxiety/comments/13t2d3c/propranolol_anxiety_and_reconsolidation_of_the/,False

I have a few ideas how this happened, but I guess I've ""aged out"" of the massive loan I took off 13 years ago (when we were rich for a hot minute and Nmom blew it adding onto/renovating The House Everything Happened In). I've been on disability except for brief periods of time ever since, knowing I'd never be able to afford a life where I wasn't dependent on other people.

My mom was likely an N (definitely histrionic) a worse alcoholic, and responsible for the majority of everything that went wrong in That House (a lot of the time she'd get us out of it, acting like she didn't create the whole damn thing in the first place). But she had a lot of legitimate gripes about my dad. The thing she didn't realize is that he just went along with the shit she said and she hadn't ""changed"" him (one of the strangest things she ever said was ""never EVER try to stop changing a person""... WTF?) She loved him, and she actually thought she'd gotten him to change, but the one thing she knew was that she could not make him love her back. He stayed with her, and enabled her, because he was too useless to do anything else.

The truth is, I did love my mom. My dad, not so much. But the issue with my mom was that the love was *unhealthy*. Still, I needed love from a parent, so I went after her. I wasn't exactly the GC (that was my older half sister, she didn't have a dad so my mom thought she had to love her twice as much?) but when I found myself being held with all the responsibility but none of the respect, I couldn't take it anymore. After a particularly bad incident when I was 24 I had to go VLC/NC for almost a year to save my own sanity.

In addition to his drinking, my dad is probably in the beginning of dementia at this point. Even if he's not, I know it's only gonna get worse from here with him. He's made it clear he doesn't want a relationship with me and I'm fine with that. I'm starting a family of my own now, my girlfriend has a 14 year old who I've known since she was born. Her father wasn't on the birth certificate and has since died, and if we have a kid together I don't know if he'll get to be the grandpa. But I certainly won't mistake the same mistake he did and treat the older kid who never had a father like she wasn't mine.

Right now I just have to pay off the few loans that ARE on my credit report, as well as my minimal credit card debt. So I'll be watching my score go up over the next few months. Maybe get another credit card so I can have another line of credit. Anyone have any tips on how to do this? Anything would be appreciated.

My memory is hazy, so some parts might be inconsistent and there might be missing pieces of information so please bear with me.
  

  
I grew up in a chaotic household. Not a day went by when my father and my brothers would fight. It gets extreme to the point where the police had to get involved. I was a child then, and I knew my brothers resented my father, but I did not know the real reason why.
  

  
Not until I turned twelve. I discovered my father messaging someone online if there were any available men he can fuck. It was a haze after that, I couldn’t focus in school and I would randomly burst into tears during class. Since my class teacher knew my aunt is a fellow teacher in school, she brought me to her. Needless to say, I told her everything and how it affected me. I harmed myself as a way to cope, and I had frequent suicidal thoughts.
  

  
She told my father about it because my depression became worse each day. One day, my parents brought me to this secluded restaurant. My father talked to me privately, and I really expected him to come clean and tell me the truth- but of course he chose to lie. You know what excuse he gave me? “It was my friend using my account. It wasn’t me.”
  

  
I knew he was lying, but I pretended to believe him because I was afraid of him and the consequences that would ensue if I choose to fight for the truth. I didn’t want to cause any more chaos. My depression continued and I still continued to harm myself because of this.
  

  
Weeks later, he found out I was still harming myself.
  

  
Instead of showing guilt and remorse for what he did- and what it did to me, he punished me for my feelings. He beat me up and threatened to ‘lock’ me up in a psychiatric ward since I had ‘lost my mind’. He knew he was the reason why I turned like this, and yet he could do that to me. I was made out to be the villain for being stuck and depressed of the painful truth.
  

  
This happened six years ago, and just recently I came into his office and looked into his laptop with the intent of gathering evidence of him cheating. What I’ll do with the evidence, I’ll just figure it out in the future. Of course, he was still fucking other guys.
  

  
One of the conversations went like this:
  

  
guy: “Let me come over, I’ll just pretend to be a masseur hehe”
  

  
dad: “Next time, it’s too risky right now. I’m dead if I get caught.”
  

  
In relation to this conversation, my brother caught my father doing a blowjob signal to two guys who came into our home.
  

  
In another conversation my father said. “Don’t come early, my kids are still awake.”
  

  
I just don’t get it. How can someone be so fucking shameless? How does he get to be successful and act innocent while my brothers are suffering from the truth? All these lies, all these manipulations, pretending that we are an ordinary family- I’m fucking tired of it all.

A week ago I (47M) passed out during bloodwork where a nerve was touched. Had never happened to me before. Lost feeling in my hands during and after the short episode. Numbness and tingling then spread over my whole body after a couple days. I now have all the symptoms described as a MS attack/flare-up (numbness, tingling, dizziness, sweating without a fever). My BP and HR have shot up as well. Came on very quickly.

My understanding is time is critical for treatment for first attack if this really is MS. I’ve gone to ER (bloodwork and CT were clear) and been referred to a neurologist but that appointment could take weeks. I’m talking with my general practitioner on Monday where I plan on asking for an MRI asap.

Could you see this kind of reaction just from hitting a nerve during bloodwork? If so, could it take months to resolve? Assuming it may be MS, what should I do in the meantime until I can be seen by a neurologist to try to minimize my chances now of relapses in the future? What else should I be asking my GP?

I also have lack of appetite, weight loss and a weird mild pain on my lower-right abdomen. I've been to many doctors and went through many tests and scans but nothing could find the reason of it. 

I've been to these doctors: Internist, GP, Gastroenterologist, Psychiatrist, General Surgeon, Urologist. 

I've had these things done: Bloodwork 5 times, Urine analysis, Stool culture, Xrays, Ultrasound, CT, Endoscopy. Everything came out clean, there was not a single problem.

I informed my psychiatrist about this and we got on olanzapine again but nothing improved after 2 weeks. 

Important things: I can't sit down because i get very nauseous and begin burping frequently but it gets better when i lay down on my bed. I can stand up but i still feel nauseous and have to lay down again quickly. My symptoms get better for a few hours when i talk a long walk outside.  

I've lost 6+ kilograms in 20 days and yesterday i could eat dinner for the first time since the beginning of my illness but it was with the help of walking a long distance for a few hours outside.

Its now getting on to 7am my time, ive been up since 2PM the previous day on just 4 hours, and again, If i tried to lay in bed right now i would just lie awake, not fatigued or tired at all.

When I do fall asleep, I sleep like a rock, I get good quality sleep, and always wake up feeling rested, and when I do sleep I sleep for a normal amount of time, just at abnormal times, after being up for abnormally long.

Besides that every other time I've picked her up to clean her eyes as best i could and check on her she was very squirmy.

I'm really scared and don't know what to do or what's going on. And for the record not only were the kittens not planned but we also can't keep them, so please don't like roast me or whatever about ""poor financial choices"" or ""why have cats if you can't afford them""

He's been doing it on and off for 48 hours now. He calms down in the early afternoon and after feeding time. He seems to be the most agitated at night and early morning. I have another cat who is acting perfectly normal, and Taco is not being aggressive towards her. It's almost like he can sense something in the apartment that I can't.  
I took him to the vet today and they said he was totally fine. Did an exam and everything checked out. They said he was constipated and were going to perform an enema but he ended having a bowel movement at the vet and they called me to pick him up. They said his agitation could be stemming from stomach pain, but when I got him home the behavior continued.  
I have looked all over my apartment for something that might be bothering him and I can't find the source. The only thing I can think of is that my roommate's girlfriend is currently staying with us for the week, but she's been here before and she's super sweet to him and he's never had a problem with her.

The mom and dad have been tested for HCM and passed in the time before breeding.

The vet said that it’s possible the heart murmur will disappear on its own, but getting an echocardiogram is probably wise regardless of whether the murmur persists or not. The breeder said the vet called it a ventricular septum defect.

What should I do? The breeder offered to pay some of the costs for an echo and is also willing to make an agreement for a money-back guarantee of sorts. We’ve been waiting for these kittens since February, when the mom was pregnant.

77,antiwork,2023-05-27 08:47:32,vburnin8tor,Written up & Verbally Reprimanded for clocking in on time.,"I work at a skating rink, and the “expectation” is to clock in once you have your skates on. See, the problem is that there is 0 ‘early’ or ‘late’ leniency meaning if you miss your clock in time you’re late.

(Safe to assume the crowding and stress around the clock in location @ clock-in time)

I learned this fact on my second day, because I tried to be a “diligent worker” & arrive and wrongly assume I could 15 minutes early. Ever since that day, I’ve been clocking in as soon as I step foot in the building with no skates on. (Additionally there is a clock in station immediately beside the employee entrance but I’m forced to use the one in the office because “You’re not allowed”)

So, as evidenced by my 99% on time accuracy stat on Homebase; I enter the building at 7:13, and make the trek to the office to clock in.

Multiple Admin attempted to stop me: getting in my way, whistling at me, & demanding I go put my skates on.
I ignore them, headed straight to the clock in station, and Damn, it’s still 7:14. I need manager pin approval in order to clock in. I stand there for less than 30 seconds, and all 3 on duty admins walk into the office.

“Hey you can’t do that, you need to have your skates on”

Okay, I’m clocked in I’ll go put them on now.

“No we mean you need to have them on before you clock in”

There is no leniency on this machine so I won’t have enough time to lace up my boots and then come back to clock. Unless you’d like me to enter the building with my skates on.

“Why are you making this difficult? You clock in once you’re ready to work, which is with your skates on.”

I’m ready to work as soon as the door shuts behind me, and because I’m restricted from being here early, I have no reason to be here early, therefore I will clock in as soon as I enter the building.

“You can’t do that. You need to be here before then to lace up your boots & be ready.”

If you need me here earlier than 7:15 for any reason, I’d like my clock in time adjusted. Like I’ve said already I’m ready to work and provide value to you once I’m in here. Hell, I’m in the parking lot for 10 minutes or more on a typical day and I don’t get in trouble out there.

“We won’t be adjusting clock in times just for you, but you will be getting ‘written up’”

Okay, I understand I’ll be written up for being here on time.

~*Cue the write-up posturing song and dance*~


Needless to say I will now be arriving early & bothering admin to approve my 69 second early clock ins.",4,3,3,0.67,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13t2863')>,/r/antiwork/comments/13t2863/written_up_verbally_reprimanded_for_clocking_in/,False
78,antiwork,2023-05-27 07:59:02,Trackswaq_4,Was this interview unprofessional? Or is it just me?,"Hello all, I hope you’re doing well. I had an interview yesterday and I am curious to see what you all have to say about it.

I initially applied for an Information Technology position at a local health clinic locally, within a couple days I had an email stating that I would like to be met with for an interview. I kindly responded to the email with something along the lines of “Absolutely, what available times do you have?” The IT manager says that he has an appointment for Friday (May 19, 2023) and for Thursday (May 25, 2023) I am a father of 3 with an infant that is barely a month old. I had other obligations to attend on the 19th, so I told the manager that I am available anytime on the 25th. The next day, (May 19, 2023), I got an email from the same manager asking if I could meet him at 10 A.M. that same day. Not a super big deal, I just thought it was kind of weird that he would ask me to come in that day when I had already specified that I had other things to attend. He reassures me that Thursday the 25th would be fine still. I show up to the clinic 15 minutes early (just to ensure that I could find where I needed to go) I talk to the front desk receptionist like the IT manager instructed me to and to ask for (let’s call him Bob). I ask for Bob and they call him and according to the receptionist he totally forgot that he even scheduled me for an interview. He tells the receptionist that he will be there as soon as he possibly can (no ETA)  I was recently laid off from my previous IT job and I have 3 children of my own so I really need the money. So I waited in the lobby in hopes that he would be there in a couple minutes  to get this interview underway. 30-35 minutes later he shows up ready for the interview. I follow him to the conference room that they have in their basement, as soon as we sit down in the chairs, he folds his legs and hops on his phone instantly and stays on it for a solid 15 minutes. (The interview was only 20 minutes long) he asks me several questions about my relevant experience in the field (pretty standard questions) but he did not seem to be listening to what I was saying and would interrupt my sentences with another question. About 10 minutes into the interview, we hear a knock on the conference door, another IT coworker of his says that another person is here to interview. (Apparently he had forgotten about this person too) this gentleman came prepared in a nice suit and ready for his interview. Bob tells the coworker that he needs to come back on Monday for the interview. I feel bad for this poor guy, I know I would have been pissed if I were him. He politely says that he will be back Monday. After he finally gets off of his phone, he looks at me and says, “I didn’t really have time to look at your resume, what are your salary expectations”. I’m not a recruiter or a manager by all means, but isn’t the point of a resume to see your candidates on paper before an interview? Anyways, I explain to him that my salary expectations are around 50k / year. (That was what I was making at my previous job) and that I was willing to go a bit lower if the position starts around that range. He tells me that the position starts off at $15 per hour, and that I could try to talk to HR about possibly getting that starting wage higher. But wouldn’t really count on it. 

I don’t see myself working here anytime soon just because of the wages alone. But I also feel like Bob was completely unprofessional about the entire interview process as a whole. What do you guys think? Am I being a Karen? I don’t want anyone else to have to go through this shitty experience like I have. I’m 26 years old and haven’t had a ton of interviews, but this experience was completely different than any other I have had.",4,1,1,0.67,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13t1gud')>,/r/antiwork/comments/13t1gud/was_this_interview_unprofessional_or_is_it_just_me/,False

we still have some mutual friends, and we have seen each other a lot these last couple of months for that reason. whenever we see each other now we chat and fake a conversation. I feel like we are all good. kinda like seeing an ex where the relationship did not end bad. but I just found out that she is really bitter with me, and are complaining to my friends about seeing me, and how awkward that is for her. our friends are just as confused as me seeing how normal everything seems in front of me, but then she is so mad when I am not around. but anyways my friends seem to be really annoyed with her trying to be the center of attention all while faking being super nice and innocent. and she also has a lot of other lovely qualities that made my friends realize how toxic she is. so is it wrong of me to hope that they cut her of? and what do I do about her, I know all of the stuff about her hating me through my friends, and she seems not to hide it from them. I feel like I have the upper hand being for not talking about her behind her back, but at the same time I want to be petty and let her know that she is awful.",0,1,1,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13t47nk')>,/r/offmychest/comments/13t47nk/i_am_happy_my_friends_are_cutting_off_my_former/,False

background. im 25f. in my teens i had a couple back to back pretty abusive relationships. both more leaning into sexual abuse and mental. i got out, i moved on. im in a happy relationship, coping well on my own outside of therapy, have a good job, a good apartment, and great pets. life's good.

He is emotionally closed off, almost never talks about himself, any information is few and far between, and half of it from coworkers. He is an ex-addict, and that would always worry me. He won't hang out outside of work because he's so introverted. More like impossible. He hates compliments.

I know I'm not special. His attentions shouldn't mean anything and it should be easy to drop this crush because honestly he can be kind of cringey.

BUT

He's so impossibly handsome to me. He smells amazing. He gives the. Best. Hugs. When I am stressed he really listens and gives great advice. When I'm sad he hugs me for as long as I need to feel okay. He's so forward and confident, comes off as very Dom, which is also impossibly sexy. I feel so comfortable and myself with him, touching him, or him to me. All the sassy flirty things I'm too shy to say to other guys come so naturally. He never judges me. 

We've talked about maybe being a thing one day, at least smashing it out, but that I need lots of time to heal from my last relationship. I adore his friendship too much to use him as a one night stand anyway. But how am I supposed to move on with life when I literally *dream* about this person? 

Every day I tell myself to drop it.

Every day I adore this hot mess a little more.

I'm tired of being confused. Tired of chasing his breadcrumbs of affection while acting proud like I don't even want it. Tired of feeling vulnerable. Tired of clumsily making advances that go nowhere. Tired of mixed signals. He wants me, but not to spend time with me, when he's casually fucked plenty of girls around me. 

Today I was sitting on a high stool with my legs up waiting to clock in and he came over, bent down and kind of half layed in my lap to say hi. I stroked down his head and his whole back and felt like I could do this for the rest of my life. He let's me fix his hair when it's messy and when I ask for a bite of his food he fixes me the perfect bite and feeds it to me. 

I can't do this anymore. It hurts.

I should get a new job. I have an offer for AGM at a friend's restaurant. I should just go. If he ever wants to see me he'll have to make an effort for once.

92,offmychest,2023-05-27 10:23:41,SadFail976,I wish either I were dead or my father were,"My (19F) father (44M) was never really around growing up and I resent him for that. Even during the times he was around, it was like he wasn’t really there. And if he was there, it would either be to physically punish me for some kind of wrongdoing or handing off his responsibilities for taking care of me to my mom. It’s as if he doesn’t want to deal with me, and nothing I do is enough to convince him otherwise. 

I never really had great memories of my father, and the good memories that I have can all be counted on a single hand. These were the only three times he actually acknowledged me for anything I did or said something as a compliment. I also resent him for being the most petty, insensitive, indifferent, insufferable, negative, emotionally unavailable person I know and the fact that I need to associate myself with him and see him now at any given part of the day makes me want to end my own life. 

My reasoning for this goes from something as simple as taking all of the sweet parts of fruits for himself, to telling me to go jump off a train platform when I’m clearly in distress and not in a good mental space, to insulting me and my appearance and invalidating my pain and suffering, to becoming physical for being too much for him to handle. I have had my panic attacks triggered by him and sent to the hospital because he would try to slap/choke me when we had an argument. Two weeks ago, we had another argument. 

I was diagnosed with a treatable type of cancer earlier year and had a few surgeries done since then and just need to go through radiation to complete my treatment. So no threat of my life being lost, but cancer is cancer and just because it’s treatable doesn’t mean I won’t be feeling like shit from the process and recovery. Two weeks ago, I was 12 days post-op  and needed to go outside to run errands but the ends of my steri-strip from the surgery were staring to curl and get caught on clothing. Before I got dressed I decided it would be a good idea to have the ends be cut off, except the incision site is somewhere that is difficult to accurately maneuver around. And I don’t want to accidentally stab myself with a pair of scissors. 

So I go to my father who is the only person who is home and available to help me, but he ends up ripping off the steri-strip instead, leaving my incision site angry and irritated for a few days. (After a previous surgery, my steri-strip was ripped off in the in my sleep and it woke me up because it was so painful so imagine how this felt) 

I told him multiple times prior to me giving him my pair of scissors to only cut off the edges only and leave the middle of the steri-strip alone, but he doesn’t heed my wishes. Much like how he doesn’t respect anything else about me either. 

I honestly don’t know why I thought it was a good idea to go to him for help in the first place. 

After I realized the steri-strip was gone and the fact that it wasn’t the scissors that were tugging on my skin but him tugging it off, I was speechless and asked him “why he would do that instead of doing what what asked”. And he replied with something along the lines of “stop making it a big deal, i did you a favor” and I stormed to my room to cry and punch the wall because I felt so violated. 

I called my mom to talk to her about what happened to calm myself down and she said she would speak with him. I hang up to go get myself ready to leave, but as I was leaving the bathroom I hear my father talking loudly on the phone with my mom complaining about me along the lines of being an ungrateful brat and other shit talk. I heard this and feel the need to defend myself, but it escalated from there and ended up with him slapping me to silence me.

We haven’t spoken since but today after a few days of radiation, he asks me if I know I need to take my laundry outside to be washed at a laundromat because he doesn’t want the household washing machine to be contaminated. I asked why and he replied saying because me and my clothes are dirty. (I have a separate laundry basket and do my laundry separately from the household but I wasn’t aware I needed to use a whole different washing machine) I honestly don’t understand whether this is coming from a place of ignorance or malice.

My father hasn’t been very supportive throughout my cancer treatment, never asked about my progress, never went with me to my appointments, never checked on me after my surgeries, etc. even said I was a liar when I got my initial diagnosis. And expects me to perform daily normal tasks that are usually easy when I am not feeling awful, when I’m feeling awful. I had a very severe bruise on my arm from an A-line post-op and was doing housework a bit slow, but he still gave me shit about it and laughed at me when pointed out I have a large bruise and didn’t want to make it worse. 

At this point, it is best if he doesn’t even step a foot near me because nothing he does helps me in the slightest bit. Seeing his face alone spoils my whole day. I feel like it would be better for me to be dead rather than needing to interact with him. I hate him, I have felt this sort of way for as long as I remember.

Whether you’re on X end or Y end of the political spectrum, a transphobe or an ally, etc…. Thinking that way is just going to piss off everyone on either side of the trans debate. Like I can see both sides, for different reasons, tearing that idea to shreds. Saw that and shit just pissed me off. 

I fall on the ally end of the spectrum and hate seeing people who are typically oppressed hypocritically turn around and treat others the same way they don’t want to be treated. Like, how are you going to be a trans woman who wants to be accepted for being who you are, only to turn around and say ciswomen aren’t real/valid women? HELLO!?!?! The call is coming from inside the house, you ignorant asshole. 

And it doesn’t help challenge bigots to change their mindset when you give them ammunition by being a hypocrite. In the live there were actually a lot of ciswomen trying to respectfully talk to the host and the host just wasn’t having it. I can’t fathom the internalized misogyny the host must have. 

Unfortunately, it’s an opinion like that, that gives TERFs ammunition to try to validate their platform. While I don’t agree with their platform, I can see a TERF seeing a trans person quite literally putting down other women and saying, “See, that’s why we believe what we do!” In closing, I’m just upset and ranting.

109,rant,2023-05-27 04:19:34,kiwilovethekiwis,I have a problem with my transgender partners,"I have a problem with my transgender partner. More than just my partner, I have a problem with the community itself. I’m not here to get into the politics of why I dislike transgenderism, i’m here to tell my story of why I struggle to date anyone who identifies as trans. I have had three girlfriends so far, all of which identify with he/him pronouns. For a lesbian, this is one of the most frustrating things to have to deal with in relationships. As a lesbian, I would like a girlfriend, and nothing other than a girlfriend. I want to tell people I have a girlfriend, I want to talk about girl things, I want to be with someone who can really get deep with me emotionally and understand how I’m feeling. And any lesbian would know that no guy could ever understand a woman’s feelings as much as another woman. Now, I’m all for a total feminine woman as a partner. I do enjoy the raw vibes and energy of a traditionally feminine woman as much as the next guy. But a bit of masculinity is what I find the most appealing. However, nowadays, you wouldn’t believe how difficult it is to find a raw energy, semi-masculine woman in our society that’s still values the entirety of being a woman. Nowadays, young girls are brought up to be confused about their gender identity. As they go through puberty, an age which they are most confused and uncomfortable about their bodies at, they are told that if you just transition or change your gender identity using pronouns then all of your problems and discomfort will go away. This is what they are taught and I have seen this in so many young women. It has gotten so bad that the only women that are semi-masculine and desirable to me as partners are those who call themselves boys and use he/him pronouns. These are the more semi-masculine women who still keep their femininity, exactly what I desire. I have dated three of these women and all three of them, right before our relationship ended, have asked me the same question; “Do you see me as a boy?” When I hear this question I know the relationship is about to go down south. I have given three separate answers to this question, and all three attempts of saving the futile relationship have failed in the same dramatic ways. And every time a new relationship fails, it hurts worse than the last. It got so bad the third time when my partner completely lost her mind after I told her the truth, I didn’t see her as a boy. She sought revenge for the rest of that year until I finally graduated from high school. She tried to take my friends away, ruin my future relationships, And even go as far as to attempt to destroy a major art project I had been building for months in the metal shop out of spite. Luckily she was apprehended by my teacher before she could destroy it. But it was after our relationship that I finally decided I would never date another trans person for the sake of side stepping around the drama and the hurt. Each relationship I had with a trans person went wonderfully for the first few months or so. But in each relationship I had either slipped up or directly told my partner that I was a lesbian. The times I directly told my partners were the times I had trusted and hoped they would be civil enough to have a conversation about our identities. And typically there would be no issue between us for another few months or so as our day to day relationship continued as normal. This is until my partners decide to bring up my forbidden sexuality once again, close to the end of our relationship. They talk about how my being a lesbian is “oppressing” them and making them feel like I don’t value their gender identity as much as they would like me to. Keep in mind, the only time I had ever brought up the fact that I was a lesbian was at the very beginning of our relationships. ONLY at the very beginning. I would never bring it up for the rest of our time together because I knew how sensitive these transgenders were about their identities. The only times my being a lesbian was brought up was by them in order to create conflict. These were the women that I would most frequently fall in love with. They were women that I valued their character and personality over, over any sort of gender identity they were recognized as in society. I loved each one from the bottom of my heart and made it my biggest initiative to treat each one like the center of my world. That’s how much I valued these women as my partners. Without their transgenderism or gender identity confusion, any of those three women could have been my partners for life if everything else flowed smoothly. That is my problem with transgenderism, the transgender community, and my transgender partners. I vowed from this point on to never date another trans person for the rest of my life to avoid the hardships that came with it. And so far, I have been “sober” in that sense for the last two months…well…up until…

But if you leave it open the smell goes away. This was when the HVAC is off already.

When I google dirty sock smell in house people refer to mold in HVAC system.

1) The HVAC system in that room is completely changed (brand new interior and exterior units). Also asked the HVAC technician if vents need cleaning or have any mold. He said not needed.

2) I called mold specialist. He said he doesn't smell any mold in the room.

1) If i turn off the AC for like 3-6 hours including it's fan.
2) If AC's running only on fan mode and I take a shower in the nearby room with doors open (this room that smells has the interior AC unit, so all the air is sucked into this room)

I guess I am looking for advice at whether this is financially wise. I could swing for a lower priced car and sacrifice my desire and wants for 3 years of my young life, and possibly save $8-$10K. But is my rationale for what I truly want and would like financially reasonable to pursue this car?

I have $2000 in a savings account (made from reselling basic clothes) and by the end of the year i’ll have $2312 (24 weeks of work as i don’t work holidays).

My questions are:
1) Will $4312 be enough to start investing (planning on investing into EFTs)

2) I’ve read the lazy uncle guide on ETF investing and was wondering if it really is as simple as it reads

3) Was there any other sources you would recommend to learn about ETF investing

Sorry if this is not the appropriate subreddit for my question. Could you please suggest where I should post it?


I am writing to ask if I should receive an increment letter. I switched to a new company named XYZ from ABC in January 2023 since the work in ABC was not good. I was supposed to get approximately 15% of my total salary as a fixed year-end bonus at the end of FY2023 at ABC. When I joined XYZ, I informed them about the year-end fixed bonus that was mentioned in ABC's offer letter. XYZ did match my in-hand pay, and there was no fixed bonus or joining bonus. So, I thought I would be getting a basic increment at the end of FY. Now, everyone else has received their increment letter except me.

Is it dumb of me to expect an increment letter? If not, how should I convey this to my director/HR? It is a small company with 50-60 employees only.

150,personalfinance,2023-05-27 06:38:53,b0zAizen,Am I entitled to an used PTO payout in this situation? (Minnesota),"Background: recently left my job of 4.5 years after turning in a two weeks notice (my last day was Friday, the 19th). I had a review 6 months ago in which I did not receive a pay increase, but they did increase my PTO to 3 weeks. I used 2 weeks right away and when I decided to switch careers I took the high road and completed my final two weeks with the expectation that my unused PTO would be paid out. 

I reached out to HR (when I still worked there) to confirm my 5 days of vacation would be paid out, and they sent me a non-answer along with a formula for calculating how unpaid time off gets paid out (earned PTO is pro-rated by the amount of time worked since review (in my case, 6-months) so I would only be paid out 2.5 days instead of the 5 days I had available to use. HR even used my situation in the example formula to explain this. 

I received my final paycheck today and it didn’t have any PTO payouts added on. I emailed HR asking about when they would be sending it, and their response was another formula they use for calculating PTO payouts, but this time they used the sum total of of PTO I was eligible to use throughout the year (120 hours) and it determined I was not eligible for a PTO payout since I was only eligible for 60 hours and I used 72 hours.

My paid time off never accrued - it was available for me to use as soon as my review was processed. I asked my supervisor if he knew of this policy and he said that he didn’t know that was a thing either. If I wanted to be a jerk I could have used my PTO for the second week of my two week notice, but since HR explained it in a way that made me think I was eligible for at least half of it to be paid out since I gave them a two week notice.

Is there anything I can do? I don’t have access to my email anymore confirming I addressed this with HR prior to leaving the company. I got a job with a larger company in the industry and fully intended to use my previous employer as a possible vendor, so I don’t want to burn any bridges but I’m kind of upset by this and it’s leaving me with a pretty awful taste in my mouth.",2,1,1,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13t06fu')>,/r/personalfinance/comments/13t06fu/am_i_entitled_to_an_used_pto_payout_in_this/,False

I was drinking every day and night and digging myself a deeper and deeper hole into addiction. I dabbled in magic mushrooms a little bit before in my life and one night I figured I’d try doing some alone. Boyyyy, I ended up having a bad trip ( and at the time I thought) the worst night of my life. I went on this weird psychedelic journey through my own head and I told myself things like “I wasn’t worth anything “ or I “don’t deserve happiness”. I thought I saw God and angels and demons… and I’m not religious. This lasted for seven hours and I thought that it was just a bad trip, but afterwards I felt extremely different. It was like my whole mindset on life changed overnight. I began slowing down my drinking, and I stopped smoking as much weed. I started applying myself more at work. I began looking deep into myself and I was actually able to commit for the very first time in my life to my general well-being and happiness. I can dream again, and I have a clear head now. I can actually take a look at myself and see what I am. 

Now I’m not saying “Everybody should go out and eat too many mushrooms!”, but I do feel like it opened a whole new door in my life. I’m happy again. I don’t drink. I don’t smoke marijuana.

""bad blood"" in this scenario is pretty derogatory as if my mother and her family isn't normal humans like any other. I have been hearing this as long as i can remember and though over the years i have come to act as if it doesn't bother me anymore i still feel unwanted when it happens. I haven't felt wanted all this years of my life that I have been living honestly. It always seems like an underlying message of "" we gave up on our own personal lives to raise you so you better make it worth."" Whenever i do something that makes them feel that isn't the best choice or action to do by their perspective i hear pretty awful remarks by them. It can range from "" we are raising you up just because that's what your dying mother wish was"", "" ofcourse you are like any other dumb child, you after all carry your mother's blood in your veins"" to ""We don't care whatever you do, you aren't ours anyways."" I know compared to the awful physical and mental trauma that many live through mine seems almost miniscule and unimportant, I'm in no way ungrateful for the fact they are raising a child that isn't their own but it always doesn't make me feel the best. 

I suffered from unaliving tendencies and SH from age 11-18 because i couldn't deal with all these remarks. Added with the being a perfect kid who gets perfect marks that i had to keep up maintaining because if I didn't i would feel extremely anxious and guilty i fell into depression . (I have been clean for the past one year which I'm very proud of) and had to seek therapy outside their knowledge. They don't really believe that one can suffer from mental health problems. Added with the 2020-2022 covid era my mental health and grades tanked and i felt more isolated that ever. Such taunts, arguments and remarks increased along with some strain in the family dynamics as my granpa started showing signs of dementia then and it affected me a lot. I have been better since then and I'm doing well but things get hard some days and today was one of them so I thought maybe I should get it off my chest here. At the end of each day I'm thankful for the relatively good life that i lead and for all the opportunities it presents but their words never makes to fail me realise that I'm not really wanted anywhere and that them raising isn't something that they chose to do but something that had to given the past circumstances.

Yes I look back now and admit that I was a bit spoiled. My parents worked so they could provide with what we needed and after it was just me mom and 1 sibling. she did spoil me a bit because I was heart broken. I was a daddy's girl to no end. 

Now my older 3 siblings had it a bit rough. I don't know much besides what I've gotten out of my mom because it was rough for her too. But besides some unfortunate major incidents I remember our life being decent. But I always remember one siblings (we will call her M) having issues. 

M was and is a bit of perfectionist. She always had to match her clothes. Her hair and makeup had to be right. Me on the other hand I would just grab and put on whatever. I was always a tomboy and she was our moms girly girl. That never ended well. So our lives were to me at the time just sibling issues. But as I've gotten older and started processing my own issues I realized alot of them come from M. She was my biggest bully. 

I've accepted that she had her own demons she was fighting at the time and probably seen me as golden child while to me that was our older siblings. But somedays when I'm not doing so good and struggling I just want her to say I'm sorry. I'm sorry I hurt you because I was hurting. I know that will never happen. But I feel like it's something I need. I unfortunately do not have a therapist atm and am working through my issues myself. I wish we had a better relationship but I can't change the past and can only look towards the future to hopefully get better.

I am from a culture that views dating as a monogamous venture, as in dating one person at a time. 

I met my boyfriend through a mutual friend and some of us went drinking at a bar. I found him really hot when I met him for the first time the day before we went drinking and asked my friend if he was single. 
My friend said “Technically yes, but maybe no. He went on a date with a girl few days ago” - I had decided I wouldn’t interfere and only wanted to see him as a friend. Cut to the next day - he was looking insanely gorgeous and attractive and I obviously felt a stirring in my heart whenever he was standing next to me. 

My friends saw the sexual tension between us and we were all buzzed. They cheered on us to kiss on a dare and we started making out, and now we are in a serious relationship and looking forward to marrying each other in a few years.

me(16F) and a close friend of mine(16F) had a big fight about a month ago. It was me who started it because almost our entire friendship she doesn’t text me or talk to me unless i talk to her first, i’ve brought it up twice before we had the fight, i’m not the only one she fought with or had a problem with, alot of her friends also have a problem with that i think.
we would go days without speaking if i don’t reach out first. and if i do, she would take hours to an entire day to respond with a one word message, 2 words if im lucky. 
A mutual friend of ours is on my side, telling me i should ignore her because she’s being incredibly weird and she doesn’t know how to act, the said mutual friend also says that she always texts her, its what convinced me i was being ignored.
After that i started ignoring her. I wouldn’t talk to her or look at her and it lasted for about 2 weeks, and in those 2 weeks she never talked to me in person or online. I blocked her on insta and she never noticed, and there were two instances where she saw me and turned the other way.
Two days before the fight she came up to me and hugged me out of nowhere, telling me that she dreamed that i talked to her, that she wanted to talk but can’t think of anything to say and that she’d speak to me after the weekend in school, the school day came up and she didn’t come to me at all.
in the fight i asked why she never speaks to me and that i always reach out first and that we’ve talked about this before. She says that shes always tired and that she has problems at home, ok understandable. I said that if she had just told me we wouldnt have these problems. She then says that she doesn’t have to tell me, and says that she’s fought with other people about this issue and that the ones who understand, understand. And the ones who don’t can fuck off.
Now every now and then she gives me looks and thats all. she would text my best friend saying that she wants to talk to me but she doesn’t. Just a few days ago she texted my best friend again saying she wants to make up, and that she can’t bring herself to talk to me when she looks at me. My best friend tells her again that im ignoring her because of how hurt i was.

166,TrueOffMyChest,2023-05-27 09:17:29,battleshipfued,Saw something unsettling today,"Okay so I can't sleep and this has thrown me off all day. Was going to get groceries with my husband, as we are walking to the car in our complex we were approching the stairs we saw a young sister (maybe about 5) and her younger brother (about 2) climbing the stairs together. Something looked very off and as we were getting closer we realized the boy had no underwear or pants on. He was fully exposed and his sister was trying to take him somewhere. My first thought was what the hell? These kids must me lost, why isn't the child wearing anything outside of the house? Why are they alone?

I immediately stopped, asked my husband to go to the car and wait for me while i ask the sister where her parents are and where her apt is so I can escort these kids to privacy. She did not speak English but pointed at her brother and said his name. She wearing traditional clothing. For context I live in the USA and there is a good amount of immigrants in our complex but I had a hunch these kids were from Afghanistan because of their clothing and names, I'm middle eastern and tried saying Arabic words but she didn't understand either. I noticed the apartment they wanted to go to has a huge Afghanistan flag in one of the rooms that I glimsped one day roaming around. The sister seemed pleased to talk to me but we couldn't communicate. The boy seemed distracted and started going down the opposite way and they both looked away and I immediately went down stairs and found their mother. 

Their mother was in traditional clothing, fully covered, and couldn't speak English, I asked if she was from Afghanistan and she nodded, she was smiling and looking extremely weird and soulless. At that point I assumed she was a refugee. She was roaming around far away from her kids and seemed like she gave zero shits when I brought up that her son is naked and he needs to wear something and it's not safe for a child to be like that in public. After a while the Convo was going nowhere and I felt unsettled cos she wasn't doing anything and I made the choice to leave her be. 

I have never seen something like this before, I live in a very hot state during the summer and even then I've never seen a very young child a exposed in such a way IN PUBLIC while people walk around the complex midday, anyone can see him and his mom didn't care. It made me think something deeply wrong is happening in their household and that poor child has no sense of privacy. The mother was fully covered but didn't bother to cover her kid?? Is this shit common in afghan culture? Have u ever seen something like this? I felt so horrible for that kid and I felt like I should have done more but I was honestly too shaken and I did what I could.

She’s my X’s sister. We’ve always been close. I’m actively involved in her family. (Two children & Fiancé. )
I recently had a baby-5 months ago 
While I was pregnant I would go see her often Visit 1-2 days & stay a few nights at a time, up until I was 2 weeks away from my due date. I needed to stay home and settle in our new apartment to prepare for my L.O. 
I worked a full time job & drive 40 minutes to see her each day that I go. 20there20back. 
Our partners stay offshore hers for 2 weeks,  mine for a month..She wants company every single day that he’s gone. I felt like with Work, My Personal life, & My first child I kind of needed a break from over extending myself. If I don’t answer/ if I’m not available Marley calls the next friend or family member & they visit her for hours or a night/nights at a time.  

Did I mention Marley doesn’t drive or work? You didn’t ask but, yes, she has a car sitting in the garage. She drives occasionally
She is well & physically capable
She’s a stay at home mom with her 1yr old & 8yr old
I take Marley and Marleys children to doctors appointments/Check Ups, Occasionally the Store & Frivolous Shopping 

Just an example of what she will have me go over for: 

One time she called me to go over because her baby was Crying/Screaming. I was pregnant and literally just got into my house from finishing up a shift at work from 5:30 AM-2:00 PM (No Break and No sitting the entire shift.) As soon as I got there she told me the baby had gas, Marley gave her medicine & needed me to stay a few hours ‘in case she needed to go to the hospital’ She knew how to handle it in the first place. I was pregnant & honestly I can hardly regulate my own anxiety
OR 
The first week after I had my baby & my boyfriend had JUST got home. Picked him up from the airport with his mom, didn’t leave the parking lot yet. She ‘needed’ me to go sit with her just in case her 1 yr old daughter needed to go to the hospital for a cough. 
I’ve told her she could call me if it was a definite need for the hospital. She said she wouldn’t be able to wait for me if it were an emergency. I’d need to be there before hand. Just. In. Case. 
I drive out of my way & have to completely plan around going to see her every single time. 
It’s stressing me out. 
I just want to be home in my own bed. I have so many things to carry back and forth from her house to mine all while having a baby & being the only one of TWO of us to do things like this. It REALLY wears me out. 

So you can see why it gets a little exhausting. I just finished taking Stateboard exams, while kind of feeling like she didn’t understand what it meant for my career. She asked me to go out to the bar an hour away TWO days before my exam. Wanted me to perform services on her like Dermaplane, Tan, Lash Extensions etc. 

I tell myself- she can’t relate. 
To the Self Discipline, Mental Preparation, the money I’m spending on Supplies/Gas for my car.  Not to mention I have a 5 month old I have to be hands on with almost 25/8 

I’m wanting to go back to work & school again. 
 I almost feel like I’m not doing enough when I don’t go see her.. I’ve tried to cut it short by going once or twice every other week. I don’t want to be a bad friend 

I’m mentally preparing to talk to her about this

I must’ve spent an **hour** simmering it, adding spices, cutting garlic into the thinnest slices ever, etc.

My friend then fills the used tomato can with water and just pours it in “to get the last of it out”.

In my opinion it was ruined. They agreed and said it was tasteless. Except that it wasn’t because of the water. It must have always been tasteless.

Friend and roommate then start making a new bolognese because obviously I was wrong. They use the ingredients *I bought* whole the roommate laughs a little while saying “sorry for just taking over :D”.

170,AmItheAsshole,2023-05-27 10:50:33,Scary_Helicopter_611,AITA for asking my roommate to give me my half of our deposit ?," Hello Reddit! I have recently made the decision to leave the expensive city I am living in and move back home. This was a somewhat hasty decision that I made at the end of April, with the intention to leave this summer. I told my roommate right away to give them as much notice as possible, due to the fact they were going to be away for a month visiting family which coincided with my move. I ended up pushing my move date back by a month to help give them more time to sort out what they wanted to do e.g get a new roommate or move out, but the fact of the matter is they get back around two weeks before I leave. While I’m aware this is inconvenient, I gave them more than 3 months notice that this was going to be happening. 

Here’s where I’m wondering if I’m the AH. I recently spoke to the building manager who told me that the only way to get my very large deposit back was for my roommate to give me my half of the money themselves, and than they would take all of it from the building when they move out. As of now my roommate has no intention of leaving here or getting a new roommate. I am moving overseas, and shipping boxes is working out to be much more expensive than I thought. I need the deposit money to help pay for that. I just recently lost my job so have no source of income.

 When I told them this, they said that it was unfair of me to ask them to pay that money right now, especially “under the circumstances I was leaving them in”. I’ll also mention that I asked for 200 less than my half in case there was a cleaning fee or damages they wanted to take out when my roommate moved. There is no significant damage to the apartment so in my mind 200 was more than enough for my half. Roomate argued that if they gave me the money now and were charged more than that 200 later, they’d be the ones getting screwed. To which I replied that if that was the case of course I’d send more money. 

Roommate wants to wait and give me my half of the deposit when they move out. Although we moved into this apartment as friends a few years ago, things have been distant and we haven’t been close in a while. While I’d like to think they wouldn’t screw me over and not send me my half of the deposit upon moving out, you never really know what will happen. I’ll be out of the country, and could literally do nothing if they decided to do that. On the other hand, if they say they don’t have the money right now… what can I really do? But like I said earlier, I need the money to help pay for my move. 

Roommate is arguing that I knew that they would be away for a month and not working as well as having to essentially pay double rent when I leave (as they don’t want to get a new roommate), so it’s unfair of me to expect them to have the money for my half of the deposit.

For the last few years, he has had quite an extreme drinking problem. Sometimes when he drinks, he behaves really badly - in ways that directly impact the people around him. He has reaped the consequences of his drinking ten fold - sometimes in big ways(near death accidents), sometimes in small ways. I have always stuck by him though, and I have provided a huge amount of empathy and compassion when no one else has. 

In December, he came to meet me abroad. Immediately, the excess drinking started. He behaved incredibly badly ( hyper aggression so intense that he got kicked out of our hostel, took my passport, passed out on the sidewalk covered in vomit and more). 

This night wrecked our relationship. Things were never the same after that. After two tension filled weeks together abroad, he blatantly ignored me for two months. He practically ghosted me. 

I spoke about the incidents and how I was feeling to one of our shared friends. We were talking out of hurt and concern. As a bystander listening in to that conversation, no one would be able to deny that we frikin love this guy. This conversation got back to my cousin from another shared friend who overhead. He was furious with me - told me that I’ve broken his trust. We worked through this “betrayal” and for the first time in months our relationship started to get back in track. 

I had also vented to another one of my cousins about that night. Again, it is not a justification, but I did not tell them to hurt him. I told her because I myself was hurting, frustrated and worried.  I did not say anything about him, I just told her what had happened and that he worries me. Last night, this too got back to him. 

He messaged me this morning saying that he never wants to speak to me again because I have spoken about him badly to people. A part of me understands, but the other part of me knows that I never spoke out of nastiness - but out of my own frustration and hurt (doesn’t make it right, I know - but I kind of see why my venting was warranted).

Lately Amanda has been obsessing over ""cute boys"" or whatever because I guess she's just at that age now. I asked her if she could babysit her younger cousin on Saturday night because her aunt needed someone to babysit him while me, her and a few others had a girls night. Amanda replies that she can't and says sorry. I ask why, and she says she's gonna tell me a secret. And I ask her what. She tells me that a boy in school asked her out, and they are going to the movies together. And she expected me to be all happy and excited for her, but I was not. 

I asked if she's really going to choose some random boy over her own mother or family. She says that I'm twisting what she said, and that this would be her first date and she just wants to go. I told her that she needs to cancel and tell this boy that they can see a movie another day, she said no. So I decided to take matters into my own hands. 

Frank gets back from work not too long after Amanda and I's fight and I'm cooking dinner but only for Frank and I. When I call Frank over for dinner he asks me where's Amanda's food. I lied and told him that she wasn't hungry. Amanda smells the food from her room, comes downstairs and asks where is her food. I told her that she doesn't get any for being disrespectful. Frank has barely eaten anything so he offered Amanda his plate and that he'd make something else. And I told him no, but he did it anyways.

I (21F) invited my dad over for dinner a couple of nights ago. We have not always had a good relationship due to him being an alcoholic while I was growing up (he has been sober for nearly a year now). I cut him off when I turned 18 and moved out but we reconciled and have been working on our relationship for the past 2 months. 
  

  
During a conversation about my future plans, I mentioned my career goals and was explaining what university classes I was currently enrolled in when he cut me off and said, “Women belong in the kitchen, not chasing some dream job” and laughed. I was taken aback by this. I asked If he was being serious, and he said “No need to get your knickers in a twist about it”
  

  
In that moment, I couldn’t contain my anger and frustration. I told him his comments were disrespectful and he shouldn’t talk about women that way. He seemed unapologetic and said he was just expressing his opinion and that I should embrace my traditional role as a woman.
  

  
I told my dad that if he couldn’t respect me and support my dreams, he was no longer welcome in my home and that we should rethink if we should be in contact. He left after telling me that I couldn’t take a joke.
  

  
I haven’t reached out to him since but over the last couple of days, I have received a messages from family telling me that I broke my father’s heart by telling him we should rethink being in contact and that obviously he was joking, and I need to chill out. Now I'm feeling guilty and not sure if I should let this go, he's never expressed these views to me before so maybe it’s a one time thing.

I lost my only extended family member suddenly last year. It was a traumatic one. My friends were so amazingly supportive, brought food and sent flowers, came to the services, came to spend time with me and my family. Except my husbands sister that I thought was one of my best friends. Her absence during the whole thing was even more obvious when everyone else was so supportive. I know not everyone has the capacity to pour into another person at all times and have always acknowledged she has a lot on her own plate with 4 kids, but she never even gave a “sorry for your loss” text after I kept desperately trying to reach out and being at such a low point in my life. 

Eventually I confronted her about it because my feelings were hurt and the distance between us kept growing and I wanted to make an attempt to fix it. She told me she couldn’t talk to me about my [addict] family member dying because addicts are a trigger for her and she has no sympathy for them, and also then calling my husband an alcoholic and me an enabler, but also that since she already felt distant from me prior to the loss that she didn’t feel the need to reach out and be a good supportive friend. We never really got anywhere conversation wise, and I was far from ready to be cordial with her after the initial convo. As such I did not invite her or her kids to my sons small birthday party about a month later - it hardly seemed like the time or place to see each other for the first time after such a loaded convo (we already hadn’t seen them for 6 months), but when she found out about it she went off on me in a colorful text and then unfriended me AND my husband on everything and told us to have a nice life.

My girlfriend (24f) and I (24m) went out to a nightclub with one of her friends who I also get along well with. 

Anyway, it was super crowded, so there was no room for me (an avid shuffler) to dance and people kept bumping into me every couple seconds trying to get through and whatnot. So as I was really not having a good time, the girls kept wanting to push deeper and deeper into the crowd. So not wanting to kill their fun, but also not wanting to have a miserable time, I said i was going to head to this open spot way off in the back. And I did. 

My girlfriend is absolutely pissed that I left her at the club. For the record, I’d never leave her alone at the club, but she was with our friend, so I thought it was okay. That said, I can see her point that her boyfriend shouldn’t have left her in the club.

178,AmItheAsshole,2023-05-27 09:42:50,Valuable-Custard6374,AITA for the way I react during fights with my SO before my breaking point?,"Recently I've been struggling with my relationship with my SO because we are getting into arguments and fights. I've been struggling to understand who in the situation is the one perpetuating the fighting, myself or my SO. I will give just the fight that happened today as an example of what happens when things get out of hand.
  

  
For some context: Earlier today I was posting on a forum. I joined a debate and was having fun with the topic with a few other people. My SO doesn't understand why I bother posting on the forums, and ridiculed me about it, which he's done multiple times in the past.
  

  
Later, we were looking at houses and I made a comment about one that had an easement on the property, commenting that the property taxes may be lower because of it by a slight amount. He argued it wasn't true, so we looked at a few houses in the surrounding area, and I was correct about the property taxes being lower, but he insisted that I was wrong, despite us comparing the numbers. Then, he tells me that he was the one who said what I said, and that I was wrong because I said what he said. This frustrated me and I said ""What are you talking about. The numbers added up to make my point exactly."" he continues to argue this point, and I tell him that I no longer want to have the conversation and that I'm done and to please stop talking about it.
  

  
He continues to push it, and I continue to tell him I am not having fun and I don't want to have the conversation with him any longer. He then brings up ""How is this any different than your ""debates"" on that forum? you just like arguing with people"". This really got me pissed off so I told him a few more times to please stop the conversation and that it was making me upset and that debating and fighting are two different things entirely. He told me ""You're the one talking about it, it's not me"". I asked him to please stop and to leave me alone a few times again before I couldn't take it anymore, so I told him ""You're a fucking asshole"" and I got up from my chair. I said ""I can not believe you are forcing me to physically leave my house in order to get away from this conversation."" and I left the house with him continuing to yell whatever his side of the conversation was at me as I left.
  

  
This happens so often, and I'm sick and tired of it. I feel like I'm the one causing these fights to start, but I don't know if it's because I actually am causing it, or if he's making me feel like I'm causing it by the way that he's interacting with me. I know that by the end of the fights I've reacted poorly and am definitely a jerk, but I can't pin point whether I am the catalyst of these fights or not. I just feel like I'm going insane.

I pull up their Instagram and try to show her their feed to convince her that it’s upscale, but she doesn’t even want to look at it.

I was jetlagged, only wanted to see my wife (25f) and go to sleep. I was surprised to see that my MIL (48f) was also waiting with my wife for my arrival at our living room. The second I walk in, my MIL starts complaining about how I was supposed to arrive at 2am, how she has been up for one hour more than she thought she would, etc.. I had sent a message to my wife that my flight was delayed, but my MIL thought that I should have sent her a message aswell, even though I didn't know she would also be waiting for me. My wife calmed her mother down and I told them that I was going to sleep. That was apparently another thing for my MIL to start complaining. She thought that I needed to empty my suitcase before I go to sleep. My wife stood up for me and told her mother that I don't need to empty it right now and I can do it in the morning when I wake up. They argued for a little while, but finally I got my permission to go to sleep from my MIL. At this point I need to say that I left my suitcase closed and it was out of the way, standing near a wall. 
Fast forward to next morning, when my wife and I woke up to a scream from my MIL. Both of us got straight up from bed and went to see what happened. My MIL stood horrified in the middle of our living room and she was looking at my suitcase, which now was laying open on the floor. My wife asked what happened and my MIL responded that she had ""accidentally"" spilled coffee in my suitcase, because I had left it laying open on the floor. My wife and I both knew she was lying, because I did not leave the suitcase like that. I looked at my suitcase and immediatelly realised that the amount of coffee in my suitcase didn't match the size of the cup my MIL was holding, because the cup was small and there were lots of coffee in the suitcase. I started crying, because everything that I had in the suitcase was ruined. My MIL started saying I was overreacting and I shouldn't have left my suitcase laying around like that. She said I was an AH because I blamed her for what happened. At this point my wife kicked her mother out and comforted me.

My buddy (m21) had invited this girl (21) he'd been fwb with in the past to hang out with a bunch of our friends. Hangout eventually ends and me, my buddy, and the girl all head back to my buddy's place. We had a few drinks and smoked a little before calling it a night. I crashed on an air mattress in the living room while my buddy and this girl take his bed. (They're friends and share the bed fairly often, and have never done anything but sleep in said bed when people stay over after hanging out)

 Now his place has a really open floor plan, so his bedroom is pretty open so I can hear everything thats happening in there. He and I have a system. No sex when the other is there, neither of us wanna hear what the other sounds like in the sack lol.

 We laid down for bed and I ended up scrolling for a few before I heard something weird from his bedroom. Tonight was apparently the night he stopped giving a fuck about our rule because I could hear him and her groaning and her quietly gasping and his bed creaking FOR 20 MINUTES. I sent him a warning text that I could hear ""something"" but I ended up having to yell at them that I could hear them.

 They got really quiet and said they weren't doing anything but I ended up saying that they weren't being subtle and should cut it out since I can hear all of it.

 NOT 10 MINUTES LATER I HEAR IT AGAIN, albeit quieter this time. I texted a different friend and told her what was up and she told me that I should definitely just head home. So I lied to my buddy and said my roommate needed a ride home from his girlfriend's place but he said that he could tell I was lying and to just tell him the truth. I told him I didn't like hearing whatever was happening in his bedroom and that it kinda grossed me out.

 He said that nothing was happening and they were just making out.

 I tried to explain that I don't want to be at his place when he's doing stuff like that and he seemed upset that I thought that ""anything like that"" was happening. 

I get that I don't know what exactly they were doing in there, and I have a lot of stuff weighing heavy on me recently so I could have just snapped over something small.

He cooked for me and actually pressured me to stay at his initially to sleep over. He kept telling people I'm his GF even tho I clarified I was waiting on an official date nd it felt too fast. He was always upset if I didn't reply on time nd when I took a holiday he was suspicious of my friend cause he didn't get to speak to her. But we were talking only 3 weeks at the time..

Things felt quick but I said I'd try since he seemed sweet and making effort . We started having arguments recently . He didn't like how I'd be upset when he'd do something. When we argued he had called me all forms of names and apologised and I accepted.

How can we get over this road blocks together?,"We’ve been dating for 2 1/2 years and when times are good, they’re amazing and when times are bad, they’re really bad. She’s very insecure so I used to keep things from her because if she found out she would be mad. she found out anyways, and obviously was very mad, an example of this is she did not like me having female friends and texting them so I would hide the amount I texted them (it was only a few times a week, but she felt like I was prioritizing them over her). 

Nevertheless, it’s been a long time since her and I have had these arguments, and I am becoming more open and honest with her.

I say again because 3 years ago were also in a relationship. I broke it of at that time because he was a huge smoker en lied to me all the time. Now i have to admit I really missed him in those 2 years and when he contacted me I was willing to try again.

Now the issue ain't with the lying anymore. He has been brutal honest since we started dating again and I appreciate that. It's the fact I think he stopped trying to do his best for this relations because. I think the reason is because we already dated once he doesn't have to ""court"" me or something and just takes me for granted.

Some examples: everytime he is coming to my place he is always late or there is something more important to do then comming over. I am talking 3-4 hours later, every single time. Whenever he promise to do something it is not happening. If he promise to call te next day, he won't. If he says he has a suprise for me, he got nothing. In the beginning he would message me goodmorning and goodnight and we would talk through app all the time and call me a lot about things, but after a few weeks I get almost no text and he only calls me late at night after his work.

When I confront him about it he calls me crazy. He says I never talk about my problems with him. But when I do, he just sight and says he can't deal with this right now and I just have to give it a place on my own. 

Last week I was done. I coulnt handle crying myself to sleep every single night. I called him up and said I didn't wanted to do this anymore and I wanted to break up. He got defensive and said that we can talk about these problems right after he got back from a camping/ small music festival. He needed some time for himself to think and I understands that, because it was already a planned trip for him to be alone with his thoughts. He also said we will talk when he get back and he will try to change. So i agreed.

Now the night before he was about the leave I called him up. Only to find out he is not going to this music festival alone like he planned to, to be alone with his thoughts. He is going with his usual group of music festival friends. In about three weeks he will go again to a bigger music festival with these group. He lied to me saying he is going there to get some rest and peace and even cancelled going to Paris with me to do so. All for something that he will do again in 3 weeks.

I am devestated. I coulnt talk with him about this because when I tried talking about it the night before he was tired and said i need to deal with this on my own until I get back. Now I don't want to have this conversation and ruin his days there (even tho this happened). But I feel broken. I will be leaving to Paris on my own tommorow so I dont know when I have a change to talk. I don't know if I can handle talking to him, because I know he will not listen, blame everything on me and just let me deal with it alone.

190,relationship_advice,2023-05-27 10:26:12,Glittering_Abalone50,My boyfriend (M25) said I (F23) cause his depression,"On new years I asked my boyfriend of 3 years how he looked back on the passed year, and he out of nowhere said it was a very difficult and terrible year for him. He could sometimes look stressed and then I would ask him what’s wrong and comfort him. To me it just seemed like a normal stressful day or week. But apparently what he told me then wasn’t all that was on his mind. I’m always there for him and have never given him a reason not to trust me, why didn’t he let me help him? He told me that when the time is right he would tell me, so I waited.

Fast forward almost 5 months later. He would often turn cold and be really rude to me. If I asked him he was ok he would say I am asking him too many questions, not to worry and to leave him alone. I was walking on eggshells. Last week I talked to him about this and that it’s very difficult for me to understand his cold behaviour without knowing the reason why. He then told me “you wanna know the reason for my depression? It’s you”. I only replied saying “oh, ok. That’s not what I expected.” I tried my hardest not to show emotions cause he would then maybe say “see?? That’s why I didn’t want to tell you”. So I just took it and eventually we came to a solution (i have to change). 

He said I caused his depression by being disrespectful. I started uni again in September to work on my future and have made some new friends (mostly guys, I major IT-security there are only like 3 girls in the whole year). Also I’ve been into going to raves sometimes. On average I go to one every 2 months, tell him with who, send pictures and he has my location 24/7. He also knows my phone password and told him he can see my phone whenever he wants. 

Also apparently I ask too many questions (he doesn’t want me to ask how his work was when he comes home, how his meeting went etc). And I’m rude. He is Japanese and the way I talk and my opinions are sometimes too much for him. I can say in my friend group I’m known for being calm. 

I’m just really hurt I can say I always do my best for him and hearing that you’re causing the person you love depression is not really nice. Also my mom passed away this april and handling both these things is a lot. I have no energy left over I’m exhausted. 

My boyfriend can be so kind, funny and he helped me through so many things. We’ve been living together for more than 2 years now and it’s the first time I’ve really felt like I have a home. I love him but I don’t like this side of him. He can sometimes completely flip his personality and it’s scary, like laughing at me in my face while I share feelings saying “why you always crying”.

191,relationship_advice,2023-05-27 10:26:01,WelcomeSpecialist157,How do I (21F) repair something I’m not sure can be fixed with my boyfriend (22M)?,"Before I start, I absolutely loathe myself for this, and I know I don’t deserve him. I just want to try to fix this if I can. Losing him might be more than I can handle. We’ve been dating about 1 1/2 years.

So to start, about a month ago, I made a horrible mistake. I got way too drunk at a house party, and was convinced by girl friends of mine to kiss a few of them. I don’t remember doing it, but I’ve been told it was 2-3. I would have never done this sober. I’m straight, no doubt about it. Immediately after I did it, I told my boyfriend and started apologizing. I felt horrible, especially because some of those friends told him he should just forgive me and let it go, “because I was exploring my sexuality.” I wasn’t. I know I’m not interested in women. I’m just a shitty girlfriend who doesn’t control her impulses when drunk.
The next day, when we were both sober, we talked. He said he forgave me, and asked that I lessen my contact with those friends, which I did. I still felt guilty, and continued to apologize, but he said it was okay. Things were off since then, but I thought it was stress from graduating and starting work.
Tonight, he called me while drinking with his friends and said he really was having a hard time forgiving me. We talked and are going to talk more tomorrow, but he said he loves me but what I did just hurt him a lot. Which is reasonable. What I did was unforgivable and I don’t deserve his love or his forgiveness. But I desperately want to make things right and to start healing. I have no idea what to do or how to start it. I absolutely hate myself for what I did. It breaks my heart I hurt him. I just don’t know what to do.

TLDR: I cheated while drunk by kissing other girls, something I would never do sober.

In my mind I just try to honor my word, if I go out with the friends. It has nothing to do with who is more important to me, which my GF argues. I just think it is common sense not to cancel without a very good reason, once one commits. And I know my friends would not do the same to me. Also since my GF is also pissed about her friends cancelling on her, I don't see why I should do the same to mine and piss them off.

194,relationship_advice,2023-05-27 10:13:54,No-Matter5594,Libido mismatch with my (22F) boyfriend (24M). What to do about it?,"I have no idea what to start from, but I really need outside perspective on the current sexual dynamic I have with my boyfriend. The situation is very complex and it’s hard for me to tell every single thing that I think contributed to where we arrived now, so if something is confusing please don’t hesitate to ask a question.  
Important information before reading: We’re in our 20’s, we started living together a few months ago and were long distance for 2 years before that (different countries)  
To put the problem simply at first: Me and my boyfriend have very different libido. This generally applies to our sex life, but specifically to penetrative sex. I, as of now, have pretty much no need to have penetrative sex, contrary to my boyfriend.  
There are several things that are affecting my situation: From the beginning, penetrative sex was painful for me. My boyfriend did not rush me to have sex (I was a virgin when we met), we really took our time and he cared about my pleasure a lot, we bought dilators etc. so I could be as comfortable as possible. What’s very important to mention was that we were both interested in more kinky sex, he had experience with it but I only had fantasies about it. My perspective now (this is not how I felt back then) is that I did not have a good enough understanding what sex like that makes you feel like in real life and how to deal with it - this intensity was fun to watch or talk about, but in real life causing me slight pain/talking to me in a degrading way was different. Wanting him to be satisfied and seeing him happy and into it in my head was more important to me than thinking if this is actually pleasurable for me. At the time, there was still an adrenaline rush to it, he always asked me for consent (which I gave) and we talked about what we were doing. In general, I would say I have a lot of regrets about that time and I’ve talked about it, but I do not think he ever actually understood how this impacted me.  
While we were still doing kinky things and having more rough sex, he has done something I have specifically asked him not to do before because it made me feel bad - he put his hand on my throat and slightly squeezed. When he did I kind of zoned out (not because it was strong just out of shock I suppose) so we continued for a bit longer, then I stopped it and he said that he “was so close to cumming” (We both don’t cum from penetrative sex but that’s a different story). I talked with him how that was not ok and he apologised and I brought up that situation several times since then when we talked about our libido mismatch. This was basically the moment when I stopped wanting to have any kinky sex and every time we had missionary sex since then (like that time), I cry. It usually happens as soon as I see him “get into it” the way he did at that moment. It just makes me feel very depersonified, like I am not a person he loves, but a thing to fuck.  
Now, we’re in a situation where we try to have penetrative sex once a month and usually it ends quite quickly with my crying or being just about to do it. He comforts me, he hugs me, he is there for me when it happens. I have incredible guilt built up inside of me anytime we have a conversation about us not having sex anymore that I am not satisfying him. I have no idea what to do - I would love to go to a sex therapist, but we are both very poor and there is literally no disposable income we have besides the one for groceries and rent. I love this man incredibly and I know I want to fix it and he feels the same, but it feels like there is nothing I can do about these things. I feel like for both of us it’s this gruelling feeling that we cannot do anything about this anymore even though we want to and we love each other. It just feels some stupid to end a relationship when there is still so much love left and you grew together so beautifully over one thing (significantly, but nevertheless one) not working well.  
I don’t know… I am thankful to anyone that made it this far. Did any of you have similar stories - something you partner did put you over the edge and you just could not do kinky stuff anymore? Is there any way out of this where both parties are happy? Besides this, I would love to hear from any women who have vaginismus etc. on how they manage to have sex regularly and pleasurably. Thank you so much for any advice!  
TLDR: My boyfriend has way higher libido than me and is more interest in kinky sex. My interest in it faded due to a few situations between us and due to the pain I experience at the beginning of sex.

He stated the poison was tasteless and odourless and small doses were undetectable in blood tests.  He then backtracked and said he was joking and would never do that.
I discussed this with my partner at the time who said he had mentioned trying to design rodent traps.
My sisters child has had stomach issues all his life.  I mentioned this to my sister and suggested a urine test should confirm if the poison was or was not present.
My sister then had an argument with her husband in which he denied poisoning the child.
The child has just turned 18 and still has stomach issues and displays symptoms that could be related to mild poisoning.  The stomach issues have caused him to pull out of school and remain undiagnosed although multiple tests have been ran.
I don't want to ruin my relationship with my sister who has been a huge support to me in life.
My brother in law is a manipulator and schemer which has led him to be wealthy, and my sister admits at times she wonders if difficult situations he places her in are deliberate and he doesn't have a great relationship with her or the kids.

From what I can best describe my vision is looking through clouds. i make six figures from rental properties, investment and disability benefits. I also have a connection with a premium airline that allow me to havve significant discount on any flight and accommodation. Anyways, I met my ex girlffriend (26f), let's call her Jen, through a mutual friend and I found her to be very sweet and caring. Our friendship grew closer and we starter dating. She knew I was legally blind and I asked her if she was sure as I might be too reliant on her. She took her time and said yes. Due to my past relationships where I was being taken advantage of, I decided not to disclose my real income and flight benefits. I only told her my income was around $50k and that i own one rental property. Our relationship was great and i made sure not to be reliant on her but she insisted on helping me whenever I struggled with navigating around places and ordering food. To reward her for being a great partner, I bought her luxury gifts and overseas trips together. She was very happy which also made me happy. However, after six months of dating, she suddenly told me she realised she wanted to have an independent partner and did not want to be seen as someone who is dating a blind person so she broke up with me. I was heartbroken but I understood. Fast forward to four months later, I invited four close friends of mine on a trip to Japan as a way to move on and spend quality time with friends. All flights and accommodation were paid by me. The trip happened last week and we had a good time. My friends were very accommodating to me and grateful for my generosity. Jen  found out about the trip from IG story posted by one of my close friends. She asked my friend about it and they told her that I paid for the whole trip and that's where she found out that I have flight benefits and I make more than I originally told her. She called me to confront me about it saying if I told her the truth she would have stayed with me. I explained to her that i have been taken advantage of in the past and that I did not want to be treated the same again. She was angry and said she is not that kind of person and that I will never find a partner ever then hung up. My friends said she is clearly a gold digger. I forgave my friend who told Jen because they thought she knew. I question myself whether or not keeping my high income and flight benefits secret was the right thing to do and if i should be honest about it in any future potential relationship. A part of me tells me she is only angry that I lied to her in the whole relationship.

However some ugly looking mosquito starts trying to attack him, and his tiny body can’t fend it off. Suddenly the mosquito is punched and destroyed by another bug. It’s a little green shield bug looking thing. Tony looks at it in amazement. He has never been protected before, he was always the one doing the protecting. He wants to hug the bug. However the bug starts talking, and reveals that it’s actually Nicola in small form. Tony withdraws when he realises it’s her. But then she saves his life again, and he can’t resist being friendly towards her. They are having such fun together in small form, and they keep taking the drug to stay that way.

After I grabbed my rifle I went back towards my front door and shot off about 10 rounds but they all missed and he kept coming in. I ran back into my room and was followed by these guys and then they started pistol whipping me. 

Next thing I know I’m at some house with them and my girlfriends sister was there telling me, “I’ve had dreams like this, you just have to let it play out” many other things occurred during this dream that were just off the wall. 

However, I kept trying to wake myself up and couldn’t. I’ve always been able to wake myself up. But this dream scared me so bad.

I get a lot of nightmares often due to PTSD from Afghanistan and being a police officer. But I normally know I’m having a nightmare and either wake myself up or control the dream a little. But I just couldn’t do it this time. 

Has anything like this ever happened to anyone? Also I apologize if this is all over the place. I just woke up panicking because this dream felt so real.",0,1,1,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13t24uc')>,/r/Dreams/comments/13t24uc/weirdest_dream_ive_ever_experienced/,False
204,Dreams,2023-05-27 08:22:51,Cyanide850,Elrditch deity spoke to me,"I dreamt I was deep in some woods. It was sunset. There was a huge cabin, more akin to a guest house, next to a lake. The lake had dried, leaving a muddy goop where there once was water.

Me and some other people were watching the mud on the dock that went into the lake. We thought something was hiding in there.

Someone else came over, telling us to stop fooling around and get back to the house. As soon as they left, though, we all saw a giant fish-like head emerge from the mud only to quickly sink back in. We looked at each other stunned. For some reason I knew what would happen tonight.

I went to the house. I thought that I should warn everyone else there, but I didn't, for some reason. Maybe I was worrying only about myself or thinking they wouldn't believe me. I wandered the maze of a house until night soon arrived.

I knew I had to get out of there. I left the house, turned on the flashlight on my phone and ran away into the woods. I didn't make it very far. My light started to dim and I heard noises all around me. I ran back to the house.

When I got there, I saw a handful of people surrounded by monsters, I suppose. Those same monsters came up behind me and I was forced in with the other people in the center. We were all surrounded. There was someone heavily injured on the dock. Everyone else must have been dead by then.

I didn't get a clear look of the creatures surrounding us, but angler fish come to mind - large mouths with sharp teeth and big bulging eyes. They were approaching us until they suddenly stopped.

Something happened then. We were elsewhere. The ground had changed into this slimy fleshy texture, covered in veins, tendrils and puddles of dark liquid. The sky was full of giant tubes made of meat with strange stars behind them. Everything was in shades of violet and purple.

The deity was also there, floating in the sky.

It's hard to describe the thing. It's body shape was humanoid, but it had no face. It looked as if you'd asked an AI to generate a human made out of only H.R.Gieger art. It carried what looked like a scythe made of flesh. The blade though, true to Gieger's style, looked more phallic than an actual weapon.

I think I screamed at it to stop this and return everyone who had died. It responded then. I wish I remembered it's response word for word, it seemed important. From what I can remember though, it went something like:

""What's happened has happened. There is nothing you can do to change that. The only thing you can do is accept it and continue moving forward.""

It was then that it made the injured person on the dock begin to go through some kind of transformation. He grew longer limbs, his skin tore as his insides bloated and blades came out of his spine and other body parts. His eyes turned white and he began to salivate heavily as he stood up. (Think human to necromorph transformation)

I think I fell to my knees.

I don't remember what happened to the rest of us. Maybe the deity made us all transform into similar abominations as well. That or the monsters around us resumed their advance and killed us. Not sure what would have been the better option in this situation.

I woke up soon after. Strangely enough, I felt no fear.",1,3,3,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13t1un7')>,/r/Dreams/comments/13t1un7/elrditch_deity_spoke_to_me/,False
205,Dreams,2023-05-27 08:21:36,Ok_Resolve637,Death experiences in dreams,"Hello! I just woke up after having a very vivid dream about dying and then moving on to afterlife. The thing is I had seen that exact afterlife in my previous dreams. I am quite sure about it although I can't remember the exact dream.

So last night I was dreaming being on a huge ship with almost everybody I knew or had seen during my life. I didn't realize this until close to dying. We were on some kind of parkour course and our job was to escape some other people who tried to get us. If we got caught, we would become the hunters and tried to catch the remaining runners. I escaped with my friends but then one of the hunters shoot me with a bow (which was maybe a fake one because it didn't hurt at all and I didn't die from it). After being caught I began catching the remaining runners with other hunters. I chased one runner very far and ended up in the control room of the ship. This was the moment I realized that this whole place was a ship. The ship began to bank and before I knew dark water was rushing inside. The ship sank very quickly, almost like the Titanic with one side pointing to the sky and one side sinking into the water. I fell down into the water with all the other people and it didn't take long for everyone to realize that we were not going to make it. I swam trying to keep my head up to breathe and find my family and friends so I could say goodbye. After a while I found my dad and my boyfriend, hugged them and tried to message them that I loved them because we all were completely under water at this point. I remember thinking ""I will see you in the afterlife."" My mother had already died because I saw a dress floating around that I knew belonged to her. I took the dress and squeezed it and the next thing I knew was that I felt really sleepy and I couldn't hold my breath any longer. I felt like I was falling, although there really wasn't anywhere to fall to.

Then I felt a thud and opened my eyes. I was on a beautiful field filled with flowers and heard laughter and speech. I got up and I was wearing my mother's dress. After looking around I realized that there was a huge lake and the field was next to it. On the other side of the lake there was this huge bright glow like the sun, but million times brighter. Then I saw cats. The cats were playing together in the field and some slept under trees. I really don't know how but I instantly knew these cats were people I had met during my time on the ship. Then I felt a tap on my shoulder and realized that one of my friends was here too, as a human. We said hello and walked together on the shore, where the waves from the wave hit our toes. There were a few cats drinking from the lake and I asked them what this place was. They just looked at me and then pointed to the lake. A huge creature rose from the water, I mean a HUGE creature. Somehow I still didn't feel scared. The creature didn't say a word but nodded and smiled (even though it did not have a face) when I asked is this the afterlife. Then I looked behind me and watched as the field, the trees and the whole place began to fill with more cats and humans. Then I woke up.

If you read this far, congratulations. I wonder if you dream about afterlife this vividly and if you do, do you see the same exact dream every time you dream about it?

Its so intense that its like i can even hear my ears making a flushing sound from the pressure like theyre about to explode.

I pass on things I need to help others and I think I've set a bad precedence because now there's no prio for gear. I'm watching teammates gear multiple characters and I'm struggling with my main.

I had to be flexible and change my spec and relearn a totally new one for the good of the team. I was told that I'd be prio'ed for gear and anyway, no one else really needed gear anymore anyway. So basically I'm getting the scraps.

So my leader keeps telling me I need to upgrade my gear. The problem is that the gear I need isn't dropping and when it does other people are needing it as well. Tonight an alt character got the gear my lead keeps telling me to get! Then they ended up trading it to another player. I swear it's a ""good 'ol boy system"" at play.

I want to leave but I have a bunch of people I'm attached to within the group that are not at fault as well as family and IRL friends that play.

220,Advice,2023-05-27 10:40:53,throwraFrequentRow2,How do I move on from something like this?,"Was I potentially dealing with a narcissist?


In 2021 I was in a position financially, emotionally to be ready for a relationship 

I’d never had a boyfriend because for some reason I never felt attracted to anyone. Like kissing made me feel weird 

And I met a man who had just weeks ago immigrated to this country and had downloaded tinder.

We talked for just over a month until I was so ready to meet him. He was putting it off, I think cause he had just moved here and was unsettled. But he seemed keen, constantly texting me with updates about his day etc 

So I set up the first date. I was on a camping trip with friends which happened to be down the road from his house, so one evening I popped out to meet him. We had a great time, instant chemistry and amazing chats. He texted me how much he fancied me and couldn’t wait to see me again

For the first time in my life, I loved our kissing. They were passionate and intense chemistry, and I enjoyed sex for the first time too. I thought I’d finally met my person. I was always turned on around him and I was the one always initiating sex 

And from that point, we were dating. I had to plan all the dates as I was the one with the car. I would pick him up and we would go hang out somewhere outdoors.

The chats we had were amazing. Shared experiences of grief and interest in music. We would lay in the park and talk forever. He was kind and sensitive and reassured me he was a nice guy as I was cautious and apprehensive with dating. He told me all his exes still want to be friends with him as they know he’s nice and harmless.

I liked the pace of the relationship too, quick to become comfortable but not rushing things. He seemed very into me, soppy messages, loads of compliments and talks of the future. I felt safe and comfortable.I’ve never had a man I like, be interested back too so my feelings were amazing 

At 3 months, I moved closer to his town, not just to be closer to him but to be closer to my work too. 

It was at that point, my housemates pointed out I was doing s lot for him and he didn’t take me on dates. I cooked him dinners and planned fun things. I was supportive to help him find a new job etc . When he was sick, I was out getting him meds and stuff for his back ache. I felt like the adult in the relationship 

I brought up the lack of dates one day. I told him ‘I feel I do a lot when it comes to planning dates. I would really like it if you took the initiative to plan things. It doesn’t need to be expensive or even cost anything.’ He came up with some weird excuses like I was better at planning bla bla bla. Even on my birthday there was no effort 

But from that point, I felt a massive change in him. He was no longer super kind and friendly to me. He gave me very dirty evil looks and little criticisms all the time. When I brought up further needs, again in a sensitive way, I was told I was pressuring and manipulative. He talked about his ex girlfriends non stop. 

His attitude toward me got worse, he seemed so annoyed by everything. Even accusing me of being bad at planning and unable to understand sarcasm. He never even made an effort to get me food and drink when I stayed at his, I would have to make sure to bring my own food so I didn’t get hungry. Even him getting me a glass of water always seemed a big annoying effort for him

At the same time I was going through a hard time with loss of my job, some awful housemates, family illness and grief from loss of a family member 

He dumped me and told me he dated me because he was lonely and never fe in love

He never even spoke to me like he did with his exes, which hurts and makes me wonder what’s wrong with me",4,1,1,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13t4321')>,/r/Advice/comments/13t4321/how_do_i_move_on_from_something_like_this/,False

I call the number for Accounts Payable that they put on the letter about 10 different times, and each time the person on the line did not understand my issue, they seem Just as confused as I am.

I was even given 2 other numbers from them that directed me to billing, and they did not understand my problem either.

Eventually, I got one of the agents to email my issue to their manager, since no one was able to help. I finally received an email saying that they would look into it and re-issue me a new check. I ALMOST got it and then they sent me another email shortly after saying that my check's funds were deposited, which is not true. There was no pending funds or deposited funds anytime for that amount in the month of April on my bank statements.

It has been over a month and I am sick of jumping through hoops for what should have been a simple fix, and I know $30.00 is not a lot to some people but that could really help me out.

224,Advice,2023-05-27 10:32:05,Sho_up,Should I break up with my boyfriend?,"So long story here. Buckle up. (I shall use fake names for this story) 

Logan and I (Sara) have been together for 4 years this December. Met when we were 18 on tinder and clicked and have been together ever since. We will be turning 22 this year. I am 3 months older September 2001 and he’s December 2001. We have similar interests and we like spending time together, we’re close and he’s my best friend. Honestly we’ve raised each other and part of me can’t imagine my life without him. We’ve been living together for just over 2 years and have lived with his parents, on our own and then with my younger sister. 

We’ve been through so much together, his parents (very toxic) and their treatment of me, which we’ve sorted but still is kinda painful, my mums death (she was a narcissist but I’m her oldest daughter and we were still quite close), my struggles with obesity and PCOS/endometriosis, his poor mental health and undiagnosed depression, financial hardship, Covid 19 and the Aus NSW lockdowns, my complicated relationship with my father and younger brother and so much more. 

Although the main reasons I’m thinking about leaving him are as follows. 

1. Tonight he got upset and overwhelmed and punched a hole in our garage door, this isn’t the first time he’s done something like this. Once he was so angry he threw a McFlurry at the ground and screamed, he broke his hand in 2 places in early 2021 from punching a floor. He knows this behaviour triggers me as my boyfriend before him threw a brick through my window and constantly screamed at me for the little things which has caused me some trauma. I’ve attempted to communicate with him multiple times and he acknowledges every-time, this happens usually once or twice a year, although the arguments and screaming has picked up over the last 3-4 months. 

2. I’m not feeling very sexually satisfied. We have our once a week and it’s usually hand stuff which is okay but I’ve expressed an interest into other things and a different frequency and I’m denied or we agree and then it’s the same stuff every-time. Consent is important and I do respect his boundaries but even then he finishes and it takes me ages to because I’m not 100% enjoying myself. 

3. We have been together 3.5 years and not once has this man cooked me a meal, yes he’s made me toast and noodles, and grabbed the Uber eats from the door, but he’s never made me a meal because “my cooking tastes better”. We’ve talked about weaponised incompetence he is quite intelligent and knows how to make meals, and he says he will try harder and hasn’t.

4. Also not once has he planned a date, he’s paid for quite a few but never called to book a table or surprise me with something special I’ve booked and organised every single one in all 3.5 years. He also hasn’t bothered to get his licence so I do ferry him around quite a bit (contributes to gas and rego) and even though again I have tried to communicate with him about these issues I am met with “I will try harder” and “I don’t want to get my licence” “I don’t like driving” etc, even though our lives with benefit greatly from him driving, taking himself places, going to his own appointments etc. 

5. Final main point is I basically mange his life. I have a genuine belief that if I don’t run his errands for him he wouldn’t do it. He is listed as a dependent under me on his doctors forms because he doesn’t want his own account, I have to remind him to call his grandparents, I go out and get him new socks when his got lost or have holes, sew the holes in his pants, remind him to pack lunch and take house eyes etc and drop off lunch/house keys when he does forget. it makes me feel like his mum which I hate. I have mentioned little things here and there regarding this specific issue but we haven’t had a massive conversation. 

I would like to add to some of the positives as I feel like so far I’ve only focused on the negatives. 

He is incredibly funny and intelligent, in my eyes physically he is beautiful, flawed like every human but somehow I feel I can look past almost anything he does and be okay. When I see him I see home, comfort and fun. He is generous, has great friends and people skills, he usually shower with me. Washes my hair and face, cuddles me when I need, strokes my hair. He smells great even when he doesn’t and we have a 2 thirds 1 third on the finance split in our house. Logan works a full time job and I have a permanent part time job and study. He washes clothes for me and takes on and puts on my shoes for me when I get home/leave for work. 

I guess my main issue is am I staying with him because I’m comfortable or am I genuinely willing to look past these rough times and move on with him? I can see us getting married (although I’m not sure how he feels about commitment) and having children, I can see him being a great dad.

226,Advice,2023-05-27 10:29:39,blackwavves,Siblings money problem advice,"Hi everyone, I have a situation that needs an outside perspective. 

My mom passed away a few years ago but had an agreement with her job through her insurance to gift a family member a certain amount of money for life every month after she passes away. I have a small family with just my sister, dad and me. So my mom near the end of her life decided to give my sister the amount of $500 bc it was the most amount she qualified for. (I would of gotten $350.) My sister who is 8 years older, also bought her first home before that time and is renting it out with a slight profit. My mom also thought my sister would use the extra $500 for life for helping pay the mortgage of the Maple house, as we call it. The one thing my mom left me was a stock account worth $5000. My mom loved us very much equally. We never had the conversation about the fairness of the distribution of money. Well it’s been about 2 years since my mom passed and my sister has been receiving a free $500 every month since she passed, for the rest of her life. If you do the math, in 40 years it will be close to $240,000 she would of gotten for free. 
Well my dad’s health is declining and we are setting up a trust. We are having a discussion, and we talked about making things 50/50 between us so there is no bad blood with money between us. She has a house with her husband and the other home she rents out. I told her how I felt it’s unfair that she is getting all this money and if it was are gonna be 50/50 from the parents then shouldn’t that be apart of that too? 
After many discussions, she agreed it’s better to pay half than have bad blood between us. I told her that if things were reversed and I got the gift of $350, I would’ve shared 50/50 with her. We are the only family we have, and we should share things equally for when my dad passes away.

Do you think it’s wrong for me to think we should share this $500 for life? Or is that fair to be equals with everything?",0,1,1,1.0,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13t3wfn')>,/r/Advice/comments/13t3wfn/siblings_money_problem_advice/,False

Otherwise, no accidents in house, sleeps in crate well, and listens well for the amount of time we’ve had her (a week).

229,dogs,2023-05-27 10:50:49,MitziKittyCat,My dog doesn't like us to pet her?,"We adopted our 5-year-old dog when she was around two years old. She was found in the street as an estimated 7 months old, and spent her time from foster to foster until we took her in. 

Around a month or so after moving with us, she started doing systematic attacks on friends when they came over. She would lunge, bark, whine, and bump her nose on their face, as if she was going to bite, but she never did bite anyone, thought it was super scary. She's a medium-big dog (22kg). Long story short, we worked with a trainer (she's our first dog), made her a safe space in the house (crate and bed), and learned to recognize her triggers, so we haven't had an incident in a while. 

One of her triggers is being pet. We are very strict with visitors that they shouldn't touch her, even though she will often rest her chin on their knees. Her attacks were always unpredictable, she doesn't growl before doing it and she will go from looking calm to suddenly attacking the visitor. 

All good now, and we have a super life all together and a lot of fun. However, we have noticed that when she's resting at home and we talk to her and praise her, she wags her tail, but when we start petting her, she suddenly stops. Are we reading her right? She doesn't like us, her humans, to pet her? Is that a thing? We're okay with respecting her boundaries even with us, but I am wondering if this is normal. She is rarely affectionate, for example sitting close to us on the couch, or looking happy to receive belly scratches.

235,dogs,2023-05-27 10:31:15,zombottica,Question about Dog behaviour,"I'm not a dog owner. Just helping feed them occasionally.

1 female and 1 male dog. During mealtime, I go up to their fence door (they have a small backyard) and gesture for them to sit down which they do. Put their dog biscuits(?) in two bowls and add a bit of water to soften.

Place both in at the same time as they are behaving well (not jumping everywhere).

THIS time, the female dog finishes her food but the male one nibbles and growls. Like a low growl building up to a bark. I verbally ask ""what's wrong?"" - in English of course. And he stops. But less than a minute later, again the growls, with a bark. I feel like he's growling at the female that's just lying down having finished her meal.

This repeats a few times.

And he left maybe a third of his food untouched. While I'm staring he just sniffs it a bit, then turns away. A few times.

I try watering it a bit more - cause I dunno what to do. But still the waiting and some growling. There's even a few pieces of food on the floor, which they usually eat up real quick.

So after waiting more minutes (I'm just here helping feed the dogs) I decided I can't leave soggy food there overnight so I get a plastic bag from the car.

When the male sees it, he starts eating. 😅

At first the vet seemed to think this was brought on by foreign body ingestion but x-rays showed nothing. He got sent home on anti nausea ondasteron, serenia and metroniazdole, and a gastroenteritis low fat canned food. Poops turned from soft serve to liquid over night. Went back in to the vet and got given proviable and biome gi canned food. 

Poops improved for half a day and then went right back to liquid with some blood in his stool as well. It's only been about 48 hours since this all started but I'm so scared

I'm devastated. I have no idea how this happened since he never gets human food and snacks are very rarely given. On top of that trupanion refused to cover our claim since he's had an episode of vomiting before. 

They want to run some expensive blood test to check his cortisol levels. I'm just so sad that my baby is in pain like this, and that this will probably be something Lifelong. He was so healthy just 2 days ago.

Vets can't tell if he will get better but didn't recommend inpatient stay so far, I'm just so anxious and I know only time can tell but I feel horrible like I've let him down somehow.

238,dogs,2023-05-27 09:47:59,Lazy_Cat1997,My dog is depressed but I can’t tell him why things have changed!,"So as we know, dogs like a routine, and a few weeks ago we were all in a happy routine. It would be like this (on a work day) : wake up 7/8am, walk, work, home for lunch break, dog Walker, home, walk, dinner, bed 10/11pm. Then me and my partner went on holiday for 3 weeks and his mother came to stay at ours to look after our 2 dogs, Lola and Louis. Her favourite dog is Louis and boy does she let that be known, she ignores Lola and says how much she loves Louis and hugs him. In the past, she’s made Louis physically sick by giving him food that I’ve told her not to when she’s looked after him, eg cake and fast food! Anyway, so I made some rules: please stick to the same routine as much as possible, don’t feed them junk, don’t walk them excessively (she’s unemployed so she will take them none stop). So when we get back from our holidays, we’ve found out what the dogs new routine looks like: wake up at 4/5am (because that’s what time they wake her up and she happily gets up and gives them what they want instead of going back to sleep), walk all day, eat leftovers, bed. 
So now we’re back and MIL has left, Louis is miserable! He can’t believe we are doing this to him, only 3x1 hour walks a day and left 8 hours alone?! How can we do such a thing! To make things worse, I’ve got the flu since coming home so he can see I’m home but I’m just lying in bed, too Ill to take him out and he’s besides himself. Lola doesn’t care much as she is a foodie and doesn’t care about walks and MIL didn’t take her out all day unlike with Louis because she’s too strong (ridgeback). 
So now I feel the guilt and anxiety from Louis, he’s sitting at the front door constantly thinking we’re taking him out, he’s started to howl, he’s not sleeping with us at night, as soon as we get ready for work he’s excited thinking he’s going out (even though we’ve just taken him out for 45mins/1hour) and he wakes us up at stupid times 4/5am! I wish I could say to him “I’m sorry, we have to go to work to make money so you can eat and have toys” or say “I’m sorry, I’m sick, I can’t get up today, please play in the garden with Lola” and instead he stares miserably into the Abyss waiting for MIL to return and give him the life all dog owners want to give. I feel like he hates his life with us now, he’s seen that the grass is greener on the other side and thinks “why am I stuck with these people when I can go with MIL”? I mean I know he’s just a dog but I’m sure they see the difference between being with person A and person B.
