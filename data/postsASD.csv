He doctor told her that ""eating food that u are allergic to will cuz u to have autistic kids"" and we kinda had an argument where i said it has nothing to do with food, and she pulled a few articles that relate allergies to autism (autistic children are more prone to food allergies and food they are intolerant to) and she said ""well he's a doctor he's right""

5,AutisticAdults,2023-05-27 04:33:12,Putrid-Occasion1881,Autism and BPD? *Vent,"I got diagnosed with autism as an adult but I know of at least 2 people that are knowledgeable on both disorders and who know I'm autistic, that have noticed enough symptoms of BPD in me to ask my partner directly if I have this comorbidity. He said the idea has also crossed his mind since we met. 

I don't have a BPD diagnosis and none of my healthcare providers have mentioned it to me in my life but then again they didn't catch the autism until I brought it up either. I was curious that so many people were seeing this disorder in me so I did some research into it and it was uncomfortable how relatable it felt. I looked into specifically how autism and BPD can overlap and how they differ and I still relate very much to both. 

I don't really know what I'm looking for. For some reason I thought my autism diagnosis would be the last major psychiatric diagnosis I would receive in my life so I don't think I want to pursue if I would qualify for a formal diagnosis right now. I think I'm just uncomfortable because it feels like every time I finally figure out what's going on with me, there ends up being something else still.

 Does anyone else have experience with this comorbidity? Am I leaping to conclusions here by assuming there's a high chance I have this disorder based on my internet research and observations from others alone? This is how I discovered my autism after all. Is it worth bringing up to my therapist and/or psychiatrist to see what they think? I worry they'll think I'm being dramatic and that I'm looking for something to be wrong with me. 

If anyone has advice, can direct me to related resources, or would be willing to possibly tolerate me venting about this some more, I'd like to know.

When the compliment is coming from my direct supervisor, though, I really feel like I should learn to respond appropriately.

I'm currently doing some light freelancing work editing and proofreading for the marketing firm my dad works at (I had to go through the whole interview process and testing to prove I'm qualified, so it's not just something I was handed due to nepotism-- especially since he doesn't even work in the department involved with copywriting at all).

I was assigned my first workload today, and I emailed my boss asking a clarifying question about exactly what all she wanted my notes on. I explained that I didn't want to offend anyone by overstepping beyond my jurisdiction and making unwelcome suggestions.

She responded by telling me to go ahead and include any suggestions I felt may improve things, and when I thanked her she replied ""You are so great!  😊"". I'm not really sure if I'm supposed to respond to that, and if I am I have no idea what to say.

I know she probably has a friendlier than normal tone with me because she's (sort of) known me since I was younger (via occasional company holiday parties with my dad, etc), but that compliment just feels so broad that I really don't know how to address it gracefully.

What do you think I should do? Does this warrant a response, and if so, how might I go about wording it?

15,AutisticAdults,2023-05-26 16:10:20,,Did anyone else internalize that “horrified” look people can give us for making social mistakes?,"I never once thought to question it. Everyone acts like that’s the “right” way to show someone they’re doing something “wrong.” But every time it stung so bad, and I interpreted that look as meaning *I am a disgusting stain on the Earth.* Even when I observe people making this face to others, I feel the same way, they are sending a message that tells the person they’re disgusting. It’s not simply displeasure or disapproval, I’ve seen that, that horrified look is sending a different message, a destructive message. That look does not say I or someone else *did something wrong* it says mine or another persons *existence is wrong*. 

I don’t know this is so confusing. I’ve found myself making that same look thinking “this is how I’m supposed to show disapproval, I’m just being like everyone else,” but it feels so wrong. SO WRONG. My moral compass screams to me that *this is not the right way to show disapproval despite the fact that it’s the socially acceptable way of showing disapproval.* It feels fundamentally dehumanizing on either end. I don’t know how to explain this to most people because for them it’s “ugh! That’s just the way the world is!” But I hope someone here understands what I mean. I’m not trying to fight the fact that this is what people do to show disapproval, I understand that and I can respect that while believing that this method of showing disapproval is destructive. It’s *shame*.

I get that most of us hate the whole “it’s not what you say it’s how you say it” type of thing, and right now it sounds like I’m being like that, but honestly what I hate most about that phrase is that people often hold us to different standards just to put us down…not cause they care about the morality of things.

Edit: I just need to get this out somewhere. I’ve violated my moral compass trying to keep up with this social stuff that I’m trying to learn. And I feel disgusting inside. I feel so disgusting. And I understand everyone else is doing it just to keep up as well, does everyone else feel that filth growing inside of them too?",11,72,72,0.99,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13shbtz')>,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/13shbtz/did_anyone_else_internalize_that_horrified_look/,False

19,AutisticAdults,2023-05-26 15:00:04,blushvibe,30/M autistic/ADHD partner fixates on cat fur?,"Hi there! I’m really happy I found this community, and I’m wondering if someone can shed some light on a question my partner and I have had for a while now. 

My fiancé is 30, and a late diagnosis for both autism and ADHD. When he was around college age, his parents got their first pet cats for the family. He’d had experience with animals before, of course, but these were his first “pets” and thus the first animals to really spend time with him in a way other people could observe. 

They noticed he was intently fixated on their cats’ fur and would politely point it out to him (without telling him to “stop”—they were pretty gentle with him) but he couldn’t stop for more than a little bit. The physical act is difficult to explain, but almost every time he’s around our black cat, he “inspects” her fur intently through staring, and moving small bits of her fur around to see down to her skin, or to maybe see underside of her coat? Almost like the way monkeys clean each other, but he’s not picking anything off of her? 

It doesn’t hurt our cat at all, and is totally harmless, but he does it a lot, and when he does, it’s really hard to break him out of it. He asked me to just gently nudge his hand out of the way when I see him doing it while we’re all family cuddling together, but he goes right back to it immediately. I’ve nudged him like 5-10 times in a row consistently, and it hasn’t helped. 

He doesn’t know why he does it, and it came on very very late in life, as you can see. He does stim with his own hair a lot (curling the front piece around his finger near his forehead)  and likes to rub one spot for a long period of time (when he’s holding me, he’ll move his thumb back and forth rapidly on my skin—this is sometimes painful for me) so he’s very tactile. 

We’re both at a loss for an explanation and are wondering if anyone else has experienced this in their partner, or does it themselves? Maybe someone can shed some light on this for us?

25,AutisticAdults,2023-05-26 03:29:57,Scout1769,I Firmly believe I have ASD. Any advice for a guy just learning about the spectrum at 29?,"My entire life I’ve always been, different. Growing up, kids and even adults would see me in a very unique light but would always dismiss it as “silly little quirks” or “that’s just how he is”. I was diagnosed with ADHD around 1st grade and I took Adderall until 2012. I never really considered anything more but something was/has always been…off about me and  my social understanding never matched even the other individuals that had ADHD. 

Where do I start? I find it impossible to control the volume of my voice, I don’t know (still) when to talk in turn without accidentally interrupting. If someone explains something one way and I explain the exact same thing but from my vantage no one knows what I’m talking about. Loud sudden noises (like fireworks and gunfire give me anxiety). I have to do thing in a certain order and it makes me angry if things get out of whack. I seem to talk normal in my head and writing/typing but I struggle to talk to others and I am amazed if a conversation goes remotely well despite rehearsing it in my head over and over. Eye contact makes me uncomfortable. People think I’m being mean or rude when I feel like I’m completely neutral or even friendly. I repeat myself a lot, and even edited this post because I kept repeating myself. When confronted, yelled at, or even anxious or overwhelmed I have bad verbal shutdowns, where I just panic in my head but on the outside I’m just blankly staring or looking down. There is so much more. 

I recently found a paper from kindergarten regarding transitioning into first grade and the observations about me that the teacher and nurse at the school had made that year executed by the guidance counselor, nurse, and a doctor they had come in the school each year (this was 1999 in a little backwoods country school). It examined basic physical, linguistic, and cognitive functions at that age. I was 5-6 at the time. I had a hard time speaking and I remember that part, they had me in a 1 on 1 language class with the guidance counselor. At the bottom of the paper was additional notes that read:

“Speech Language -Diagnostic
We highly recommend special classes for **** 

Observations:
 **** shows high potential for PDD-NOS & ADHD. We advise you as the parent/guardian of **** that he sees his pediatrician before the new school year. 
*There is more to the note but there is an old stain that made some if it illegible.”

From my understanding PDD-NOS was an old diagnostic criteria for Autism before it was changed to ASD. (Please correct me if I’m wrong) 

My entire life my parents never told me, nor did they pursue it with the pediatrician or any of my doctors. I struggled all the way through school and barely graduated in normal classes when I should have been in special ed…it was brushed off as ADHD because my mom always did the talking at the doctors and I was only allowed to say what she coached me to say, and now I know why…I guess she just couldn’t accept the fact her son had a learning disability. 

*side note I grew up in a wealthy but abusive household as an adopted only child. 

I’m married now and still struggle everyday with the same things I always have but it is way different as an adult.
There is so much more to my story but too way much for Reddit, I’m also physically disabled as icing on the cake so I’ve thought about starting an instagram or a YouTube channel to help spread awareness but I don’t know if it would catch on. If anyone has any advice on getting an official diagnosis and how to better understand and cope with this new discovery please let me know.

We spent more on the headphones because they have good noise cancelling, which he uses a fair bit when he is overwhelmed. He also uses the phone a lot to listen to music when he is out of his comfort zone. Otherwise it’s used for typical teen stuff - social media, watching YouTube, chatting with friends, etc.
Anyway, Max is not good with his possessions. He is always losing them and dropping them, treating them roughly etc. I think the word careless summarises it best.  He has had to replace or pay for repairs on a few of his items in the last three years. He saves up his birthday/Christmas money from us and his grandparents but doesn’t have a regular job. We keep offering to give him pocket money if he will do some jobs around the house, but he refuses (he says ‘I’m too lazy’.) I won’t let him get a job outside the house until he starts doing some jobs at home, as my belief is that if he has enough time and energy to earn his own money, he has enough time and energy to help at home first.
Anyway, in the last month, Max has lost his headphones at school somewhere (and they have now probably been taken by a less honest student), and this week he has dropped his phone and broken it. He doesn’t have enough money to replace/ repair them.
Part of me feels that he has to learn responsibility for his items, and needs to not be bailed out when he is being careless (things we have told him repeatedly, like don’t walk down the street on your phone, not looking where you are going, but he does it anyway). But part of me recognises his neurodivergence is affecting his ability to be careful with his items. I am ADHD myself, so I often lose my phone/headphones/ wallet etc. And I accept that it is part of my brain and wouldn’t hesitate to replace my own items, even if it was a stupid mistake on my part. I forgive myself for my neurodiversity.
How much should I do the same for Max, and how much should I be trying to teach him responsibility? Am I creating a spoilt teen if I pay for replacements, or am I placing unfair neurotypical expectations on a kid who is struggling with executive functioning?",24,18,18,0.89,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13s0ucv')>,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/13s0ucv/advice_from_autistic_adults_for_my_teen_he_lost/,False

I made a post in a chronically ill group about advice for staying hydrated as someone who hates water. 

I’m AuDHD and hydration has always been a struggle for me. I didn’t know it was strongly due to things like not getting hunger and thirst cues properly, things like executive dysfunction, other symptoms of AuDHD that just make care task so damn difficult to do. 

Most of the responses were great and I have tons of suggestions to consider. But one person started off their comment with “I hate to break it to you but part of being an adult is drinking water”. It felt patronizing, I have a lot of rejection feelings towards any kind of behavior people push as “normal”. Because even tasks that are necessary, just because need to do them even for my health, it doesn’t make it easy. 

They also started pushing the whole “sugar is bad” thing. And idk about anyone else, but as someone who got shoved into diet culture really young I struggle with disordered eating. And it’s important to pull away from this idea that some foods are good and some foods are bad. So I let them know this and asked them to just be more mindful, and I assumed they didn’t mean to be patronizing but it did come off that way. 

Things just escalated and it turned into them making fun of me for asking for advice but then not liking their advice. They said I was “bitching” because I wouldn’t drink water but complained about not being hydrated. They then compared me to their mother who complains to them about their weight, to which they tell her not to eat sticks of butter, and then they added their mom is always offended by this. 

They claimed to be AuDHD as well and said it didn’t stop them from “training” themselves to drink water. 

Tbh the whole situation made me cry. I’m scared to even post here that I might be antagonized by others. As someone who struggles to build connections, I just always assumed spaces like this were easier and people were always more compassionate because they can understand. This person triggered all the things I fear about my AuDHD which is that it’s not disabling, I’m just lazy and don’t want to do the work. And that I’m not willing to take help that’s offered, and that I over complicate things or I make excuses for why some things are hard. Idk. I just wanted to try venting about this, I’m not asking for advice.

I didn’t worry about this as much until after I got diagnosed because the doctor who diagnosed me described me as having a ‘flat affect’.

I (20f) study nursing. I'm in my 3rd year (out of four) and we got the news today that our whole year will go from 3 to 2 classes. This meant that they mixed all the groups. Most friend groups were kept together and some were split (for example mine, we got split 2-2, when our teacher (who was involved in this) has subtly tried to split us up for 2 years now, we are good students fyi).

This made everyone fairly upset, because we will now have classes of 26 and 27 people, instead of 3 with 17/18. We got very different news 2 weeks ago (that our while class would have the senior year together after working towards it for 3 years together).

I am the class representative, and decided that next to the messy and high emotion debate there will be tomorrow, we should send an objective and respectful email stating what it has done to us.

Now this is where I messed up. Some of our current classmates currently do an internship abroad. I should have included them more in the process before sending it. 
I learned later that they stand very differently in this than us (they are more emotionally detached and more accepting of this outcome).
We had the idea that maybe 2 girls (abroad) would want to change with 2 of my friends. This way everyone would be reunited with their friends. We wrote it down and I included that as a solution in de mail, when the girls abroad hadn't agreed to that yet. I have apologised to them both multiple times and send another mail stating that the names named shouldn't have happened, because not everyone had said yes to this yet. 
The girls did say they didn't blame me, but next time to communicate to them first and that they hope this doesn't have any consequences. That made me feel alright but horrible.

Later I got more feedback that some others from abroad found it to emotional and had some comments about wording and points made. We called and everyone explained their side (them not finding this very nice towards the new potential classmates and me saying we purely wanted to express emotion in this and tell what it did to us about what and how it happened). They sounded okay with it, and I did apologise multiple times again that I should have included them more.

I am crying rn, because I should have waited longer to send it, even though a different teacher said it was nicely written and my whole class said to send it.

Everyone forgave me or said it was okay, but I'm still very disappointed in myself.
I'm so tired these days (I'm also overstimulated from having so much going on and really want to do everything right)

Curious what doubts you had to wrestle with before you ended up receiving essentially a confirmation from a professional. What helped you to overcome these doubts?

I fear I wont be able to articulate this in an assessment because I am in burnout and that they will remain invisible, or that these internal strategies/systems if known will somehow be not enough to qualify me as autistic.

Yesterday I had barely slept and was the warmest day of the year so far, I chose the wrong clothes (too high neck and the cotton top was a bit too thick). The bus was too warm. Here I was already on thin ice. 

Got to uni and this alarm kept going off. We tried to have a seminar outside but it was loud, so we went inside again. I didn’t feel comfortable stimming too much and my nerves were fraught…

Bought lunch and the machine messed up my order… twice. But eventually I got it right. Picked a book up at the library and then went to look for a book for my dad because his birthday is next week. There I got the call I was dreading, but knew was coming, that I didn’t get a job I really wanted (they wanted me but someone else had more experience)…

The straw that broke the camel’s back was that I hadn’t gotten my summer schedule for my job despite them telling me I should’ve gotten it last week. Not getting this job made me severely anxious about not getting the schedule. You know how it is… they said something and it wasn’t happening, and and the uncertainty just had me in bits. 

I was crying so much and I couldn’t stop. Everything felt out of control and I was panicking. There had been too much noise and there were too many people. But because I knew what was behind it, that I was having a meltdown, I put on my sunglasses and put videos on with subjects that calm me, and I immediately went home. 

I couldn’t communicate, but I could get home and rest. By the time I came home I had my schedule… but it upsets me so much when someone says that I should get something within a specific week and it doesn’t happen that week. I’d rather get a vague timeline than that (I think)

41,AutisticAdults,2023-05-25 18:01:52,VermicelliNo2422,How to Not Overanalyze Myself?,"Long story short, I’ve recently been diagnosed with ADHD and all of my medical professionals believe I’m also Autistic, but they don’t have an official system to diagnose adults, so I’m stuck in diagnosis limbo. In the mean time, I’ve found myself overanalyzing everything I do and think.

For whatever reason, whether I’m starting to unmask, notice my tendencies more, or I’m internalizing symptoms and signs of Autism, it seems like literally everything I do lines up with either common Autistic experiences or symptoms. The more I think on it, the more it feels like everything about me is caused by something, instead of just being who I am. My interests are stereotypical, I’m more aware of how oddly I move, I can’t stop overthinking my thought processes. Even in therapy, I’m more and more aware of how many of my problems can be explained by me being Autistic. I thought it would be a relief to have an explanation, but instead it’s brought up so much self doubt and insecurity that I can’t help but study everything I do.

Does anyone else get stuck in this loop? Is this typical for people who have just found out they’re neurodivergent? It’s shaking my sense of self, making me feel like nothing about me is me, and I’m just a compilation of symptoms. How do you get out of this thought cycle and just accept how you are?

42,AutisticAdults,2023-05-25 18:01:13,Broad_Taro_Trapz,Not diagnosed with ASD but seems likely I have it and not sure what to do.,"Long story: I’m in my 40s, and my whole life I have felt different from others, like I don’t fit in. I have dealt with serious anxiety and mild depression since I was a child. I have been diagnosed with ADHD-c mostly off of extremely inconsistent school performance when I was a kid: if I found something interesting I could learn it easily and retain all the facts forever, but if something didn’t interest me I couldn’t  (and still struggle to) focus, I daydream constantly and looked for something that would interest or stimulate me. This involved destructivity and hyperactivity that would annoy my parents and teachers. I also had impulse control issues that nearly got me arrested several times that have gotten better but I still struggle to use any sort of social media appropriately. This all sounds like run of the mill ADHD, and ADHD meds help somewhat. 

But I have also always felt very uncomfortable in social situations, like I just don’t know how to act appropriately. My default were either over the top behavior that others found annoying (I learned to control that as an adult) or shutdown (in a corner by myself/fleeing). I can fake being normal for an hour or two but I hate it. So as an adult I don’t really socialize at all if I don’t have to and I really have no friends outside of my immediate family. I have 3 interests I am extremely obsessive about and I can’t imagine not being able to pursue them. I have a job that fits one of my interests and I am pretty good at it, but I try to find excuses to avoid socializing with
my coworkers. They are good people but it just feels awkward and stressful for me. 
I am also married with three kids, and my youngest and I are extremely similar. She was a really challenging child behaviorally since birth (just like I was) so we started seeing therapists and eventually a psychologist and at age 8 she was diagnosed with ASD without intellectual or language impairment. She is now 13 and the similarities between us are only more apparent now (with the main difference is she no longer has any violent outbursts that I continued to have until age 20).

My wife and other children are now convinced I have ASD either in addition to or instead of ADHD-C, and I suspect they are correct. 
My question for you all is do you think this is something worth pursuing with a psychiatrist? I realize it would be better for my family if I was less obsessed with my routine, and I do wish I had friends. I feel like I know how to make friends but what I have to do to make friends-hanging out, making small talk, planning things isn’t worth it.

47,AutisticAdults,2023-05-25 17:16:12,Independent-Alps7271,Isolation feels easier,"
I’m NB afab and 28. I realized I was on the spectrum a few years ago but am only now starting to accept it. It’s so lonely. I know no other autistic ppl. I know that could potentially help but I’m so exhausted and depressed. Sorry it’s a long one, there’s a tldr below. 

It’s not that I can’t find joy in some interactions it’s that I have to wade through so much anxiety and confusion to hit upon enjoyment. It makes interacting feel scary and not worth it. I live alone and don’t work and leave the house on average once  a week (this has gotten more inconsistent) for groceries and to do laundry at my moms. My sister also lives there. I have no adult friends besides them and a new one (my first one that’s not family) I’ve been solely texting because in person is too hard. Even with her I told her I had to take a break due to issues with isolation. 

I really love my mother and sister. I don’t know what I would do without them and their support. I like my new friend, she’s so kind and funny! But interactions always feel…well bad. 

I’m able to unmask at times with all of them but I usually end up feeling ashamed and confused about even being a person? Like hearing my voice can be nails on a chalkboard but I compulsively keep speaking and seeking reassurance (I also have OCD) then just spiral. I always cry around them and get ‘existential’ as they may say. I’m just so depressed and confused about myself and life it’s all I can focus on. I think of it as an unstoppable overflowing. It has to come out and I’m powerless to stop it. I feel like I’m too much and not enough constantly. I feel like nobody knows me and my pain. I just want to fix it maybe but obviously talking doesn’t help. Makes it worse honestly but I can’t stop. 

I feel Infantilized often. Even though I know it’s not intentional and there’s no Ill will behind it, obviously it still hurts. As if I’m just a little baby who just doesn’t get how to be a person yet. But I feel I’ve never known. 

With my new friend I struggle to feel I’m enjoying our friendship even though I know I like her and the things we talk about. My body just feels so tense when speaking with them and after interactions I pick them apart endlessly worrying I did something wrong. I always think I did something wrong and ppl just won’t tell me. Reading between the lines is exhausting. I’m struggling not to break it off out of fear and exhaustion. 

TLDR: It feels easier to isolate. I’m incredibly in my head all the time when alone and it’s hell but it feels like a “hell you know” type of thing. It’s preferable to the strain of interaction.

49,AutisticAdults,2023-05-25 15:48:57,SolyLunaX,"My male partner is suspected to be Autistic, but refuses to seek diagnosis/treatment. It’s taking a toll on our relationship.","My (39M) partner of 3 years is suspected to be autistic by our couples therapist that he hasn’t gone to in about a year but I still see. He shows many characteristics the biggest ones being a very negative reaction to intense emotions (especially mine) to the point that he literally physically runs away from me, and hypersensitive to any real or perceived criticism. ANY … it’s impossible to have a conversation with him about anything negative even when I try as hard as I can to use all the communication tools I’ve learned in therapy. He usually blows up and if the topic is specifically triggering he becomes verbally abusive. 

I (34F) am diagnosed ADHD and have my own triggers and issues, especially with rejection sensitivity which is the icing on the cake since he is minimally affectionate and while most days I know he loves me, it’s very difficult to actually see it. 

Anyway, I’ve spoken to him several times about my concerns for him as well as for what it’s doing to us as a couple and he’s just not having it. He refuses to go to a psychiatrist or even back to therapy with me. When we first went to therapy it was going well until it started bringing up feelings for him he just could NOT handle. 

We’re both Latinos which adds another layer of stigma to mental health which plays a huge part in his reluctance, since any kind of neurodivergence is seen as “crazy” and “lack of motivation” that can easily be fixed with faith and determination so that doesn’t help the situation at all. Not to mention it makes it nearly impossible for him to understand MY issues and MY meltdowns at all. I recognize he doesn’t have the tools yet to understand or manage it but it’s really hurting me. 

I know that inevitably if this doesn’t get any better I will need to walk away, but I would really like to find a solution. He was my best friend and has been my ideal partner in every way and I just don’t know how to move forward from here. I know if he doesn’t want to help himself there’s not much I can do and that it’s not my responsibility to do so, but I would really like to find a way. 

Has anyone been effective at getting a loved one to treatment? If it was you, how would you want your partner to approach it? Any other advice for me that would also help preserve my own mental health?

I don't get people, I try but I don't understand how they're minds work and used to try to fit in but never did. I had some trauma in my early 20s that made me stop trying and since then I have lived alone with very little social communication. I find people scary I will avoid them irl because I'm scared of offending them and it turning confrontational, in that instance I will either lock up like my operating system crashed or just loose the ability to think straight making me talk loud/erratic.


I started painting models a couple of years ago and felt I did a ok job for a beginner but had nobody (friends or family) to ask if I was being bias over my own work, so I joined reddit. I posted my work and the response I had was overwhelming, I had never had positive reinforcement like that from anyone but my own mother, I literally cried with joy (it still makes me overwhelmed to think of it).

It was through my new found hobby and the kind people of reddit I eventually started to open up to people, I was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder in my early 30s and joined so I joined a reddit sub for social anxiety. It was in that sub someone surgested I may have undiagnosed Autism and suggested I took some online test.

I took those test and scored very high on them suggesting a high possibility I have some form of Autism. Since I did them (a couple of months ago) I have spent every day obsessing over what Autism is and reading/watching/listening to any information I can get.

I come to the point where I need to go see a doctor and ask for a referral to a specialist but I don't want to waste the time of a already overwelmed NHS. What if I'm not Autistic and I am just the broken thing I have accepted myself to be. I should imagen the assessment process is expensive and I don't want to waste resources on me that could help somebody in more need.

My special interests are psychology and religion, so naturally I'm very interested in the many places where the two meet. I've recently stumbled across this idea that a large part of what motivates people to participate in religious group activity and attaches them so strongly to their particular tradition is this seeking after and enjoyment of collective effervescence (a phenomenon where individuals in groups can begin to feel and act as a group rather than individuals). I've read that people seek after this experience instinctively to develop and strengthen social bonds. This has been posited as a possible explanation for group religious experiences of connectedness with a god or gods, the holy spirit, etc. It also is thought to be part of why people in modern times enjoy group activities such as sporting events and concerts, which have shared mechanics and psychological effects with religious group activities.

The kicker is, I hate this feeling! I've experienced collective effervescence and it felt like my brain was hijacked by a stranger. I also don't care for concerts or sporting events, but I always assumed it was because of the overwhelming stimuli. Now I wonder if it also is due to my avoidance of this phenomenon. Also, despite religion being a special interest, I am not religious. I've tried to participate in multiple religions and join multiple religious groups due to my high interest in religion, but none of them ever fit for me. I'm curious if this is an autism thing, but I can't find any data online, anecdotal or otherwise, about autistic or even other neurodivergent opinions/experiences related to collective effervescence.

One of my favorites is 90 Day Fiancé and all of its spin-offs, so naturally, when Match Me Abroad came out on TLC, I hit play. 

The basis of the show is that individuals who are interested in dating abroad hire matchmakers and go out on arranged dates. 

One of the (adult) men, who is autistic and openly identified as so on the show, has HIRED one of these matchmakers who is horribly, horribly ableist and infantilizing toward him. She has continually and literally compared this client to a “little boy,” said she “feels like she needs to look after him,” said he “will be the most challenging client she’s had yet,” said he “has a very boyish energy” and feels like she’s “welcoming [her] younger brother,” and is of the opinion that, and I quote, “he is looking for his mommy.”

Only a few episodes are out so far of this show, so I can’t say how it ends up or how much worse it may get, but I’m calling it out now. This is harmful and hateful.

67,AutisticAdults,2023-05-24 17:36:21,The_Teacat,Has anyone's family ever used a meltdown against you and/or lie to others about what actually happened?,"I've never talked about this one but it's happened a few times with mine, who are very conservative people who don't really believe in special treatment for things like this, and believe that if you're not on their side, you have to be Stockholmed until you are. Any sense of self or personal identity is not quite allowed and will be used against you unless it serves them. I'm still recovering from a lot of it and it's impossible to predict how much unwiring I already have to do, but I tend to be their scapegoat since I fight against it as much as I can.

But yes. I know there's nothing ""wrong"" with me, but they like to manipulate certain reactions out of me so they can demonize me even more. Specifically they've done this with meltdowns and my attachment to sentimental objects about as long as I can remember, seemingly just because they can. It's set me back a *lot* and left me with trust issues as well as anxious and depressive issues I don't like acknowledging since I'm concerned that gives them a ""win"", and I don't like admitting they can have that affect on me. (And it gives them more ways to toy with me and overpower me.)

This happened as recently as a few years ago, during an event where I was having a small, personal crisis over a financial issue. I wasn’t very comfortable around my family at the time and was going non-verbal while processing it, but the main culprit kept stalking me around and trying to force an answer out of me. It ended up not well; I ended up screaming at him to leave me alone as I kept having to retreat further and further to try and find privacy since I was so upset and embarrassed, and all he would do was follow me and? Act like there was anything he could do?

I ended up getting cut a few times trying to get away and was in the process of dealing with that as well and he still wouldn't leave me alone and that just pushed me further. And some windows were broken and he lied to the police about what was happening to make him seem more sympathetic, and none of my family understands what was actually happening and how unsafe and in-danger and just plain upset I felt; when all I needed was some privacy to get my center back and process some shitty feelings. They just demonize me for it now and barely even talk to me; all I wanted was to be left alone during an obvious meltdown? A deeply embarrassing, frustrating moment that their forced involvement kept exacerbating?

I've been dissociating a lot since then, because it's hard to feel safe showing any emotion or vulnerability around them knowing what they might do. I have a very hard time feeling confident in myself, telling stories about things that have happened, and taking responsibility for things due to everything that's happened to me in situations like this. Am I the problem here? These are the people who used to hit me just for being upset with me, punish me for being upset about things, and scold me for basic emotions without understanding why I was so frustrated, and never really helped me in a way that didn't serve them too, so obviously it's difficult for me to feel comfortable showing these things around them, and it's easier to shut down, but it's obvious they can still exacerbate meltdowns when they need to use them against me.

Has anyone else's family done this or been like this? How do you feel safe when they know they can use basic aspects of your brain's wiring like this and when you know they're against you anyway? I've been trying to leave for a long time and they just keep finding ways to remove that ability from me and attempts to infantilize me to keep me further held back and control me/take advantage of me even further. It's not so fun and feels super not nice actually speaking, you know?

My husband and I have had a rollercoaster of a relationship as far as highs and lows, and not being able to properly communicate our issues and be in sync. I’ve recently started questioning if my husband is on the spectrum after a friend of mine was recently just diagnosed and had a revelation that a lot of his life struggles could have been better managed better had he known sooner, and it made me realize that my husband has a lot of those similar qualities. Once I realized this might be a possibility it was like this lightbulb when off and I started wondering if a lot of things I was getting frustrated with were because of the possibility of his ASD, and it made me see him in a new light (and even has made me pause before getting frustrated with him after realizing maybe he can’t help certain things). 

Here is my list of things that have made me question this:
- He doesn’t make a lot of eye contact with me, and when I’m telling him a story I often find myself saying “Are you listening?” And he snaps back “Yes I’m listening!?” 
- He gets a lot of anxiety when going to a new place, and always asks where we will be parking when we get there and is anxious the entire drive 
- He doesn’t like when plans are “sprung” on him, and it makes him mad and have caused several fights between us if my family invites us over “last minute” (aka a couple days away). 
- He always questions everyone’s motives and constantly thinks everyone is against him or is talking behind his back, even when they are not.  
- He goes through phases and obsessions over things, and it completely takes over his mind. For example: for months he played the same video game for hours and hours every day, then for months and months he obsessively watched YouTube videos about skateboards every night, then for a year or two he obsessively got involved in the QAnon cult movement online (it almost ended our marriage because it was affecting me and our kids). 
- He gives “squeeze hugs” where instead of gently hugging me sometimes he’ll squeeze me so hard that it hurts and I have to tell him to stop 
- He uses the same phrases in conversation constantly. 
- He doesn’t like anybody (even me when I’m just cleaning our house) touching his things, and gets very angry if he can’t find something of his. 
- (This one has caused a TON of emotional conversations and arguments between us) He doesn’t seem to understand how to comfort me when I’m upset, or even show any care when I’m sitting in front of him crying about something. He stares blankly at me or just says “It’s ok.” in a monotone manner. And when I say “I feel like you don’t even care about me or care when I’m upset” he always acts really confused and says “You know that’s not true? I love you”. It’s just so confusing. 

If you made it this far I really appreciate it. I guess I just find myself constantly questioning myself and constantly questioning if these qualities of his are part of a high functioning ASD. He has a full time job, he provides for me and our kids, he’s very funny and I love him of course, but some of these qualities have made it really difficult to understand each other and for me to communicate things to him.

72,AutisticAdults,2023-05-24 15:34:59,idkijustlovemydog,I'm so sick of my supposed friends. I bought tickets to a concert for three of us in advance. No one even mentioned paying me back until I brought it up. And still haven't been paid back. Plus so much more in post,"There was a concert that was gonna sell out fast (my friends love the artist and so do i). I tell my friends about the concert and we're all excited. We hang out and they agree to pay me back so I buy 3 tickets while we're hanging out. Total, they were $300. 

When it comes close to concert time, I arrive to my friend's house on time. I checked a million times and the concert started at 7. My other friend doesn't even arrive until 8:30.

We finally get to the concert at 9:00 and it's over by the time we get there. My friends really didn't care at all. Because they had no intention at all of ever paying me back for those tickets...

The money itself isn't what bothers me, it's the principle. I shouldn't have to remind someone to pay me back for a $100 ticket. I reminded them a few times, but I shouldn't have to beg to be paid back. Let alone 2 fucking people. These two people are always acting entitled to my belongings. Whether it be money, my time, food, rides, mental space, literally anything. And I'm so fucking sick of being disrespected.

The thing is tho.....it feels like everyone eventually starts to treat me like this. If I want friends, it seems like I have to settle for people that will be ""the least"" rude to me if that makes sense. I am so sick of it. I don't want to become bitter but it's hard. 

Sorry for the vent, I just really needed somewhere to post this. The way I'm feeling right now, I never want to see these people ever again. But I know I will....

I'm terrible at talking to people, but I'm wondering what some of you would say to these ""friends"" if this happened to you. I need some help formulating what I should say to them. 

 I only ever really reminded them twice to pay me back but I feel that's enough. I shouldn't have to call out everything they do to earn respect. They know damn well what they're doing and they're just taking advantage of me and don't care.

The problem is - or the problems are - my psychiatrist doesn't want to refer me to anyone who can diagnose autism since I already have the BPD diagnosis. Plus there's only one place that can test someone for autism here and there's one day in the entire year where you have to call them for an appointment - for the next year. 4 hours where hundreds of people call that person to ask for an appointment.

81,AutisticAdults,2023-05-24 03:59:32,Naima92231,"At 61, It Occurs to Me That I'm Probably On the Autism Spectrum.","Last year I reconnected with a man I met in my late-20's (he's 6 years older), whom I considered a (very attractive) friend. I've know and cared about over the decades, but I got married, moved, had a wonderful son (now 24), eventually separated 
/divorced and move to another state with him, just to get away fro my ex.

But eventually I moved back (with my son) to the town I love the most, where my old friend still lives. He's 67, and I'm 61.

When we re-connected, he shortly thereafter went into the throes of some serious health complications. He'd lost a lot of weight and basically couldn't get up from his living-room floor to even feed himself, and was skeletal. So I brought him to my place for a while, where I could keep him fed, get him to doctors' appts., etc.

He continued to stay with me (or I'd stay at his place) after he got better. We were very affectionate with each other, but it was always platonic (not my idea--I'm seriously attracted to him, but I'm
not sure he understands why!).

Over time, he's become less physically affectionate (we've never even kissed). I don't mind (TOO much) not having sex, but we still sleep together sometimes and he's much less cuddly (not always, but more distant). I really miss that.

But he's warm and funny and talented and delightfully quirky. I love him as my best friend, but it's hard.

Anyway, a few months ago it dawned on me that he might be a very smart, high-functioning person on the spectrum. I slowly introduced the possibility to him--especially his sensory issues (I didn't question him much about sexuality), and a few other things. He seemed interested, and not insulted, by the possibility. We watched ""Rain Man,"", and now we're both always quoting from it.

I often tell him that, even when he makes no sense, he makes more sense to me than anyone. I trust him (not a common thing with me!), and I love him--I'm just not sure as WHAT, but that's pretty much okay. Well, sometimes it's been painful, but he knows that, and he's always kind and sweet (if a little hyper-critical sometimes). We tend to be there for each other, and he's obviously put effort into thinking about how I feel and adjusting how he responds.

I enjoy spending time with him more than anyone in years (aside from my soon, but that's different, of corse!).

I think that he and I tacitly agree that he's an ""aspie"" (I know that word's not used much any more), and, as I've learned more about it for his sake, I'm starting to believe (at 61!) that maybe I've been on the spectrum my whole life as well. For a long time I've thought that I have (and now get medicated for) ADD, but when I think back over my life and interactions I wonder..

I've taken a few online autism tests, with varying results, but today I took the AQ test and tested 33 out of 50! The questions can be so vague and difficult to answer, but I assume that's the way the tests are designed.

So, I guess, what next? I've never particularly trusted therapists. I just think back over my 6 decades, and how badly things often turned out at jobs, etc., and I guess I'd just like to understand. I know there's no magic pill for it, and I guess I'll always be this way.

But I've always carried a lot of shame and a lot of ""not quite fitting in,"" and I wonder if I can somehow reconcile all that, or if I can.

So, he talked me into accepting the full service and everything looked legit. They had me sign some papers and they left with half the money ($200 USD). They came back the day after and “fixed” it, I paid them another $200 + tip. Two hours later, the washing machine wasn’t working anymore.

I immediately called them and they told me not to worry, they would come back the day after. That was last Wednesday and they haven’t. Every time I call them they give me a bs excuse and promise me they’ll come soon.

Mind you, I’m not from the US, things like this are a little more informal in my country, so it’s not necessarily strange to pay people upfront and just trust they will complete the service, normally there are no problems.

But, I’m feeling iffy about this and I’m now assuming I’ve been scammed for $400 USD. I’m researching my legal options, but knowing my country’s justice system, I don’t have a lot of hope.

103,AutisticAdults,2023-05-23 06:53:31,Valgrimm93,Identifying triggers for Late Diagnosed/Self-diagnosed Adults,"\*Cross Post\*

 I found out about 8 weeks ago I am likely autistic and have been in burnout essentially ever since. I have noticed that when I am at almost zero energy and am in a safe space, I am often numb and don't feel a whole lot of anxiety or much else. When I do something to recharge some energy however, like go for a walk in a park or partake in my interests (primarily PC gaming), I actually will gain some ambient anxiety to feed off my newly gained energy even when otherwise completely comfortable. For example I was playing a game much of today and felt fine, but as soon as I logged out, I was hit my immediate low grade anxiety, which has been sticking with me ever since.

My guesses as to what might be causing this is:

1. Anticipation of my intake screening appointment with a therapist specializing in autism in about a week, to determine if I should move forward with adult diagnosis. I am feeling fairly sure in my self assessment, especially since hitting burnout and figuring out what was happening, but am frequently imagining what I will say in the appointment even though I really have no idea yet on the format.
2. Stimming. Now that I am aware of my stimming, including some (realistically many) I didn't even know I was doing before I started watching for them, I feel like I perhaps have more conscious control of whether I do them or not. I feel like I am actually doing things I did subconsciously all the time before (rhythmically twitching my fingers, shaking my hands, etc) less since I am more aware of doing them and just don't. I do literally feel a compulsion to do some things when I am not though. Do those aware of their stimming have to do so more consciously?
3. Some unknown irritant I haven't identified yet.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to how to identify what is bothering you when you are having obvious stress from somewhere in a place that otherwise seems safe and relatively trigger free? I am just wondering if anyone has any suggestions for identifying triggers, or if could be due to lack of conscious stimming (or accidental conscious suppression of stimming). Thanks in advance for any suggestions.",8,5,5,0.86,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13pgp0x')>,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/13pgp0x/identifying_triggers_for_late/,False

After my fourth fight in two days with my partner  about not being able to recognize tone, decided to take a quiz. And another one. And another. Results were consistent with my life so far, and some stuff I didn't even realize was ASD. Not being good in groups, not knowing when to talk, being too literal, needing plans, etc. Over a literal decade of feeling weird, out of place, etc. It all makes sense. I have so much research to do and resources to seek out, horray.....

Edit: forgot to say how I learned lol. Took some tests, then talked with my partner of 7 years. She agreed, apparently thought so since we met but there's no good time to say something like that ""hey you're cute and sorry about your trauma I also think you have autism"". Then today i talked with my therapist that I've been with for two years (for my own other stuff lol) and he agreed that it explains many things, and reframing past events helps. So he's going to treat me as if I have it, and recommended I get tested, which will take 7 months to schedule.

Edit 2: Oh wow some of you guys are way over valuing the tests and do not consider a licensed therapist who's been working 15+ years and has been my therapist for over 2 years to be a good judge. Obviously a few online quizzes are gonna do much, which is why I discussed them with my CACREP accredited counselor.

Hes not necessarily autistic (hasnt been diagnosed) but he has a lot of similar sensory stuff--like the way stuff feels really matters to him and can bother him a lot. And I mean I assume not all autistic people with sensory experiences like this have the same or even similar senory experiences... But I know theres some various suncreen options out there and  I thought maybe regardless someone here might have similar feelings and might have found a sunscreen that doesnt Bother Them.

I have struggled to maintain relationships with my peers or love interests all my life. I've struggled more to socialize with my peers in early years of my life, as nobody had any romantic interest in a ""weird girl"" like me. This struggle made me, since a young age, shutdown from the world around me in a regular basis. I would dissociate most of my days, at school, home or anywhere I would go. I would create fantasy scenarios in my head with my favorite fictional characters at the time and I would mostly just live inside my head all the time. 
Now, later in life, I keep doing this and it affects me harshly. I seem to end up doing it more and more in cycles. Basically I start a romantic relationship with someone I really like and if the relationship starts to deteriorate I try to communicate what needs to be worked on. In my experiences, my ex partners usually don't seem to care to work on taking care of our relationship and I start to slowly loose interest and hyper focus on this scenarios in my head again more and more. Until I am basically not living with the person am with anymore, I'm only living in my head all the time. My routines get transformed in going to work, barely eating and going to bed super early in order to be in my head as soon as possible. I struggle doing anything else besides shutting down and dissociating into those fantasy scenarios. 

Can anyone relate to this or any similar experiences? I feel desperate as I cannot escape this cooping mechanism... I know that I'm loosing precious moments of my life that I could be actually living but I get trapped inside my own head...

This is apparently a form of backchanneling - a linguistics concept about interjecting in conversations.

Instead of the NT eye contact, we tend to use the 'grunt' response, nod, or other non-verbal acknowledgement. I did a brief Scholar search, but didn't find any scholarly discussions on this.

1. We are going to do marriage counseling. 
2. Whenever I am feeling a little anxious, and at my wits end. I am going to say Yoda time. Also if I feel like I need extra alone time I’m going to say Yoda time 20 minutes or so on how how much time I need. If I’m on the verge of a meltdown I will hold baby Yoda in my arms. 
3. If my husband feels I’m being rude, he will say spicy with a number that my tone is at between 1 to 10. If he is feeling triggered by my tone, he will say ghost pepper.
4. We will have daily check-in’s explaining where we are with our moods.

I (19NB) find it incredibly difficult to change my problematic behaviour and establish new, healthy habits. I'm fairly good at identifying what exactly needs to change, but actually doing so is ridiculously hard for me.

I'll use an example - I'm a very self critical person and this often has a negative effect on my ability to cope in certain situations. If I perform badly at an activity, I will ridicule myself to no end, leading me to vocalise my anger at myself and sometimes spiral into self harm. 

Obviously, this is not good as it not only hurts me, but drives others away too. I've tried different things like breathing techniques, stim toys etc to distract myself but I haven't had any success. This further reinforces a strongly ingrained belief of mine that I am incapable of improving which then makes me even less likely to do so than before.

Then, say that I told myself that I wanted to start going to the gym to improve my physical health. Maybe I'll go for a few days, but after that I no longer have the motivation to do so because of my belief that I am inherently incapable of making any positive changes to my life. That's not to mention the sheer amount of times that others have told me that I am lazy for not improving myself which not only doesn't help but further perpetuates this cycle.

I wanted to ask if any other autistic adults in here experiences these problems? If you have found anything that helps you personally, would you mind sharing?

I can sleep for 13+ hours when i fall asleep, but it takes me usually 2 hours to fall asleep.

Hes prescribed me Stilnox which seems to be Ambien by another name. I can feel a ""change"" im definately sleepy, i go to bed, but i still cannot sleep. I know i am not sleeping, my husband says he notices when i do because i will not move and my breathing changes, and when it does come on, it is quick, i will fall asleep mid convo with husband. Thing that bugs me is its still taking 2 or so hours when the dr said to me it would be fast acting and should work in 10-15 mins. Has anyone else experienced issues with sleeping medication just not working as it should do? Im still only getting about 4 hours a night and taking it earlier does not extend my sleep as i seem to wake up about 8 hours after taking it. Ive been on it a week so wondering if it takes a while to work.

The other aspect is he has prescribed me concerta, which i am happy about as I have awful executive dysfunction and i want to try stimulants to see if i can make all my thoughts stitch together so i can complete something. My dr has told me to take the ambien for a few weeks to rule out sleep issues causing my focus issues, but with the sleep pills not doing what he said they would either, im tempted to just take the stimulants.

Im next seeing him in September and he said to do what I feel works for me, but Im curious if anyone else has experience wtih sleep medication not working  as i dont want to rush taking the stims if its just a case of ""it gets better"". My dr suggested a month between taking them, but he also said that sleeping tablets would work right away. I feel a bit like I am stuck in limbo. I know i can take the stims now, he said that i could take them when i wanted but it was his advice to give it a month to see how i feel on the sleeping tablets. Problem i have is im getting frustrated because it feels like the sleeping tablets dont work, but at the same time i dont want to add another medication to the mix if a bit of patience is needed.

""heaving breaths"" in short, do i slow down and see how the sleeping pills work over the month or do i take the stims to try and get some semblance of functionality?

(It was a dragon necklace, FWIW) Person 2 nodded at Person 1 by way of an answer, then got distracted from any further communication with Person 1 by my commenting on their necklace.

When I'm nervous or new to a situation, as I am with this group, I tend to try to joke around, am blunt, and tend to interrupt/openly eavesdrop on others, etc. I felt bad about this interaction later, as it occurred to me that I inserted myself into their conversation like that, and I might have inadvertently prevented Person 1 from getting to know Person 2 better.

Anyways, I have this thing where I think WAY outside the box. Like so far out of the box I look stupid. Like normal people are seeing the picture but my dumbass thinks it's something else. Let me give an example.   


A while ago, I saw a post on Twitter. It was a picture of a fake 1 million dollar bill and the caption read, ""I'm so fired"". The joke was obvious to everyone else- a cashier that took a fake bill thinking it was 100 dollar bill. My dumbass? I thought he worked at a fucking factory where they made the bills and he printed the wrong bill.  Technically a vague posting like that can be interpreted anyway but why do I always miss the obvious? I also questioned myself because I'm pretty sure money-making factories aren't a thing where people put the print on the money..   


This way of thinking usually happens when something is vague. Seems like everyone instantly gets it but my brain goes so far from it. Another time, my professor asked us something along the lines of, ""How are two people behind each other but see each other?"" He was basically testing us. So I went further outside the box because that was this test he was doing. I said, ""because the laws of physics don't apply"".  It's because they were standing behind each other.

I noticed that pizza was pretty gross though. The cheese was awful. I’m really picky about cheese. So in a silent moment, I say this pizza is not great. Just an off hand comment and I was still eating it. This really upset my wife and we got into a disagreement that’s left another bad taste in my mouth. She said it upset her because I was being negative and devaluing the food our family was eating and that it was rude. I didn’t get that at all and just felt like her personal boundaries around other peoples feelings were lacking in that moment. I would have understood it being rude if she or someone else had cooked it and/or picked it out. However she had nothing to do with it. I don’t see how I was devaluing it by not liking the taste. It’s not like I said this shit should be in the trash. Do any of y’all get what I’m missing here?

I'm not in conscious control of it, it really feels like a separate person living inside my head most of the time. And it's constantly telling me that I'm inherently broken, that I'm not a 'full' person, that I'm a burden on everyone around me, that I have nothing to offer others aside from superficial 'niceness' that's a product of my fawn response trauma, that I'm incapable of relating to others in a positive way or contributing anything of value, that I wouldn't have survived into adulthood under natural circumstances and I'm only alive now because my parents created a sheltered environment, etc.

I have a lot of difficulty with deconstructing these thoughts because I don't really have any rational arguments against them, just emotional ones (which doesn't work with how I think). As much as I'd love to have a more compassionate worldview, these thoughts unfortunately seem logically sound to me. I just wish my brain would stop repeating them to me ad nauseam.

I was diagnosed as a child, so I've perceived myself as 'broken' for a looong time, and I've had this toxic monologue in its current form for at least a decade if not more. It's completely destroyed my self confidence, it's made me utterly terrified of going on dates, and it's lead me to sabotage some of my social relationships.

Has anyone here experienced something similar? And if so, has anything worked to silence it? I've been trying mindfulness meditation, but it honestly feels like squirting a water gun at the sun. I have less of a 'monkey mind' and more of a 'dragon mind'.

154,AutisticAdults,2023-05-21 17:40:09,tinyghostdragon,How to tell whether the doctor assessing you is wrong/uninformed or whether you are misinterpreting your own traits as autism?,"Hi, everyone. This is pretty long, so bear with me. The TL;DR is that I doubt this particular doctor's ability to assess me for autism but I'm not sure how to judge whether she's right or whether I am, given her reasons seemed not great.

So, I had a doctor's appointment recently about me possibly being autistic. I've suspected it for about two years now, starting from seeing a bunch of relatable social media posts and then talking to my autistic friend, who said that she has been heavily suspecting that I might be on the spectrum or neurodivergent in some other way. Her then partner also thought so. 

So during these past two years I've been reading books, personal anecdotes online and articles, listening to podcasts or single episodes, doing all the at least seemingly reputable self-assessment tests I could find. And evaluating my past as well, of course. Everything indicates that it's very much possible, maybe even probable that I am autistic. I have differences in social skills and socialising is very tiring to me, I have sensory issues, I need a predictable structure to my life, I show signs of literal and black and white thinking, etc, etc. In short, I think I have enough traits to reasonably suspect that I might be autistic.

So I go to this appointment, not really sure what to expect. The things the doctor then asked me included whether I have a special skill, any intense interests, sensory issues, whether I have been bullies and what kind of sensory issues do I have. There may have been other things that I have forgotten. This whole meeting took about 30 minutes. Now, this doctor, who was very nice and polite, seemed not to be too familiar with autism and how it can present itself. She told me that to her I don't seem autistic because

1. I don't have major functional issues,
2. I have a Master's degree and am planning on getting a PhD,
3. I have friends,
4. I can make eye contact,
5. I can put my emotions into words.

My boyfriend and autistic friend thought these are crap reasons to think I'm not autistic. And I have to agree. Number #1 is probably the only thing I can agree to even on some level. Sure, I can take care of myself but I sometimes forget to eat and take a shower (until the dirtiness becomes a sensory problem on its own), and I generally have trouble with executive functioning unless I have a good routine going. Which I don't, atm, but that's not the point here. The fact is that I currently have low support needs, whether or not I am autistic or something else, and according to the doctor, that alone means that I probably wouldn't get a referral to neurological examination. She did say that we could continue with the process (for which I would need to get documentation from school, medical system, the lot) but if I'm still not likely to get a referral, I didn't see the point. Maybe I'll go again to a different doctor some day, with more preparation as I now know better what they want to know.

Numbers #2 and #3 seem like stuff that don't really work as arguments against me being autistic. My Master's is in the field of a special interest of mine (languages) and the PhD is going to be about languages too, if I manage to make it happen. And the friends thing just seems... arbitrary. My oldest friends are neurodivergent, so is my boyfriend, and my uni friends are from my field so we all know the same stuff about communication and language use, and of course we share the interest in languages. In short we have the tools to think about our communication with each other, regardless of our neurotypes.

Numbers #4 and #5 are partly covered by that language special interest. I've studied communication. But not just in uni. I remember as a child and as a teen consciously thinking ""oh, I should do this thing"", like make certain facial expressions, or tone shifts. My autistic friend even commented that when I'm relaxed with her, I have a pretty flat tone. As for putting my emotions into words, I've had to learn how to do that a long time ago. I'm FtM trans person, so I had to go through a diagnostic process for that in order to get medical transition approved. And more recently I've been in therapy to deal with a burn out triggered depression, so yeah. But knowing how to do something doesn't mean it's easy or that I've always known how to do that. The eye contact thing is something I can force myself to do (and I do force it) or I fake it by looking at the general direction of the other person, if they're far enough away.

One of my problems (in general, no idea if it's related to autism) is that I am really bad at telling about myself without being prompted with fairly specific questions, and sometimes even not then. It was likely a major hindrance here. Even now writing this I wonder what things should I include to make the conctext as clear as possible without writing a whole novel.

Anyway, given that it's often said that a professional should have a final say on the diagnosis, my question is: how do I know if they are a professional in this matter? How do I assess the validity of the evaluation? At this moment I still think I might be autistic but should I count this doctor's evaluation as a mark against the possiblity?

He does not seem to manage it well and will barely talk about it although I'm not sure he knows how to communicate what he experiences to those around him, including me. 

In the past, he's used discount clinic psychiatrists who diagnosed him with depression and IED, but only gave him an antidepressant and wrote him off around covid when the doctor shortage got bad. As a result, when things get bad, he self medicates with alcohol (in aa now). After moving to somewhere more affordable, it's gotten worse as he struggles to deal with change and is struggling to hold a job and fit in. 

I got him set up with Cerebral and helped him get his full medical history in there, but it is running us about $500 a month for a psych, therapist, and meds.

I also see a lot of stuff about how it won’t help to get a diagnosis anyway because there aren’t a lot of benefits to it once you’re out of school and don’t need a 504. Part of what really scares is me is stuff like people saying that having a diagnosis is going to stop me from getting gender-affirming care or from going to other countries and things like that. 

And it’s like. I did have an awareness that there can be downsides to getting a formal diagnosis before I got diagnosed, but I feel like I personally needed to. Aside from feeling like I was ‘faking’ all the time, I also feel like I do need a diagnosis for people to take it seriously. I even had a therapist who refused to listen when I told her I thought I was autistic and treated me very badly because of her belief that she just needed to treat me as though I have ‘severe anxiety’. This would include turning her camera off and ignoring me if I had trouble talking for too long and forcing me to watch a video of someone getting surgery while they were awake and making me watch the whole thing again if I moved (I was also being treated for a needle phobia). 

Along with this, I have a lot of severe phobias relating to medical care, particularly anything with needles. Me being autistic is pretty relevant to this because my reactions in a medical setting can be downright dangerous. I will scream, fight, try to escape, shut down, and/or avoid getting medical care I need altogether. Before getting diagnosed, my parents would just tell them about my needle phobia and doctors would underestimate it and think I would just have a little anxiety, so they wouldn’t be prepared and things would go badly. Now that I have a diagnosis on paper, doctors seem to understand a little better, even if I get kinda infantilized sometimes. When I needed an MRI, and also when I went to the ER, the doctors easily agreed to give me Valium. Nurses are a little nicer and will listen (for the most part) when they’re told how to keep me calm. The hospital and doctor’s office don’t argue when my parents need to stay with me. I feel like having the diagnosis in my chart really helps make things go a little smoother. 

When I was younger, I could kinda get away with avoiding the doctor more ‘cuz I was mostly healthy physically, but for the last few years, I’ve had a lot of health problems (including cancer that luckily didn’t need chemo but still sucked and had medical consequences). I can’t avoid getting medical care anymore because I now have life-long health conditions as well as some health problems that will hopefully resolve eventually. Which forces me to go into very stressful situations at the doctor all the time. I wasn’t diagnosed yet when I had cancer, and I needed it removed during the height of the pandemic, and my parents had to argue to be able to stay with me because of COVID restrictions. I was also held down when I freaked out about a finger prick because the nurse wouldn’t give me a minute to calm down. The dentist wouldn’t even let my mom come with me at all when I had to go. But I need my parents to be there both for comfort and because I tend to shut down and no longer understand what’s happening or be able to respond to questions. Without them, I just agree to whatever people say to me, no matter what it is. I’ve signed papers without understanding what I’m signing because I’ve been too scared to process them. 

It really just feels easier to have everyone on the same page and to have accommodations to keep me calm. I feel like I need a formal diagnosis to get medical care without being traumatized. 

But now all I see is people telling me how I’m stupid for getting diagnosed and stupid for putting it in my medical file because people say my rights are going to be taken away. But I feel like I didn’t really have a choice. What was I supposed to do, get held down and sedated by surprised doctors whenever I have a medical problem? Get traumatized even more until I refuse to go anymore and end up dying from something preventable? I’ve needed help and accommodations and just wasn’t getting them before, and I was not getting medical care I needed. I avoided getting a surgery I needed for five years because I was too scared. 

I’d rather be treated like a baby than be held down, and I’d rather tell the doctor I’m autistic than catch someone off guard while they’re putting needles in my body. I don’t want to lose rights like people keep saying I will, but I feel like most discrimination I’ve faced is the same as before even I knew I was autistic. I just didn’t know why people reacted to me a certain way before. And I can’t do anything about legal threats to my rights because my medical care is a more immediate need than a threat. 

So I don’t know. I’m just getting the impression that a lot of other autistic people think it’s dumb to get formally diagnosed but I feel like I didn’t have much choice anymore. And I’m just tired of constantly being scared that I’ve made some kind of huge mistake when I just want to get medical care.

EDIT: I’m reassured by the responses to this post. Sometimes I just need a little reminder that people don’t all have the same opinions as other people I happen to interact with online. I was just getting really worried about some things I’ve been hearing. 
(Also, to clarify, I do think self-diagnosis is valid, just as I think some people need a diagnosis. People have different needs, I was just starting to feel like the choices I made based on my own needs were bad because of how certain people have been talking and scaring me)",41,57,57,0.94,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13ncs57')>,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/13ncs57/i_feel_like_a_lot_of_people_are_scaring_me_now/,False

170,AutisticAdults,2023-05-20 20:42:51,Missleaded_,"How do you deal with boundaries and being perceived as ""difficult"" when you set them?","Hi! I'm new here, and I found this Reddit a very safe place to explore my diagnosis.

I'm a high-capacity autistic adult and I tend to be perceived as a Neurotypical person since it is not evident that I'm autistic. This is hurtful but I understand that is not their fault not knowing how diverse the spectrum is, so I brush it off quickly and change the topic. 

Lately, I started to explore all the situations that trigger my crisis, and most of them, maybe 90% of the time, are triggered by people overstepping my boundaries. For example, making decisions without my consent about something that involves me or talking about their implications beforehand, making a change of plans without asking how that affects me or my schedule. This is very frequent and kind of difficult to deal with since I don't feel safe disclosing my diagnosis to everyone, but it's really something that brings out the worst feeling I have ever experienced.

I don't want to go and say ""Please don't do this because I'm autistic"" since people always find it difficult to deal with me when I share that I feel disrespected or start gaslighting me into being convinced it's my fault. How do you deal with this kind of experience?

To give you some context, I'm supposed to attend a concert with friends, but they decided to upgrade all the tickets (three, mine included) to a more crowded location without even asking for my opinion. I'm sure I would have told them that I was ok with it since at least it would have given me a heads-up beforehand, however, I realized that just when I received an email with the info. When I told them how disrespectful it was to do it without even asking, they told me I was making a fuss out of it and started to receive very harsh messages from them, saying ""ok, you're angry, good for you :)"" ""you can go alone, I down-graded your ticket"". I went through a huge meltdown after that.",8,20,20,0.96,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13n837f')>,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/13n837f/how_do_you_deal_with_boundaries_and_being/,False
171,AutisticAdults,2023-05-20 20:17:03,AutisticIntrovert383,College/university is not built for us.,"I know this has been discussed before on this subreddit and the r/autism subreddit.

I attend a college which is on a quarter system and the classes last 10 weeks. This is 10 weeks of extremely fast-paced instruction and learning. The quarter system runs from September to June and consists of a fall quarter, winter quarter, and spring quarter. The quarter system lasts for 10 weeks. The college/university expects all students (regardless of neurotype) to adjust to the quarter system in 2.5 months. At my college/university orientation, the advisor said, “In our eyes, you all are adults now. You don’t have to ask to use the restroom…” This is ableist. We autistics do not mature at the same speed as NTs. Mentally, I still feel like a 13-year-old.

If I could go back in time, I would take a year off before starting college/university, as this would mentally prepare me for the rigors of college/university and the quarter system (10-week classes). In this way, I would be prepared and be able to adjust quickly.

The classes that I am taking this quarter are Maths 2D (Multivariable Calculus I) and Physics 7D/Physics 7LD (same class) (Electricity and Magnetism). My major is Computer Engineering. Despite one of my special interests being electricity (plugs and voltages), I cannot focus in my Physics 7D lecture class and discussion class. I am in week 8 out of 10 in my third quarter. I am almost done with my first year of college/university.

This is my third quarter. My first and second quarters were extremely challenging (new environment, new quarter system). I have still not adjusted to the quarter system. Hopefully, by September (start of second year), I will be adjusted.

When I started college/university in September 2022, we (students) are expected to figure out college/university on our own without any help. We (students) are thrust into an entirely new system and expected to figure it out with little to no help.

For us autistics, the adjustment period is closer to 1-2 years due to the sudden change in the pace of learning and instruction (10-week classes), workload (vague lectures and homework instructions) and the frequency of exams. All this causes an increased risk of a meltdown. I hope that I will be adjusted to the quarter system by September 2023. This was my first time attending onsite (in-person) classes after 2.5 years of online classes due to COVID-19.

In my EECS (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) classes, the professors explain the lectures in a vague/unclear manner, and they assume that we have already learned the subject before the quarter. They expect us to be “mature adult engineering students”. The professors don’t explain homework assignments. The professors explain the instructions in an unclear way and expect us (students) to figure the assignment out on our own. My professors always say, “You’re an adult. Figure it out. I’m not responsible for helping you with the assignment.”

Thankfully, my Maths 2D and Physics 7D/7LD professors are clear and direct. The questions on the quizzes and exams come from the textbook and homework problems.

Now, even though COVID-19 is still a pandemic, the professors have gone “back to normal” in their lecturing style. This means no online classes and no recorded lectures. My professors are not obligated to record the lectures. However, my accommodations state that I can record the lectures. Since I have slow handwriting, I take pictures of the lesson material. My professors have no problem with this.

As a result of autistic inertia, my mom has to sit next to me when I do my homework. Otherwise, if that doesn’t happen, no work gets done and I start going on other websites. Website blockers and timers do not work.

My accommodations in college/university are:

1. 2x extra time on quizzes/tests/exams
2. Recorded lectures (I can audio record the lectures and discussion sessions.)
3. Access to scratch paper (lined paper) on quizzes/tests/exams
4. Quizzes/tests/exams in a separate location (DSC\*)

I'm now freaking out inside","I DO have diagnosed anxiety after going thru some traumatic events past decade (childs death, 1 very abusive relationship but that was awhile ago, seeing the SO being ran over by a truck). Been struggling with a lot recently. Was recently switched to prozac and was also given a short term prescription for xanax to calm the nerves (I seem to wake up everyday with what feels like a very physical/in my tummy dread and terror). I'm in therapy, etc. In therapy it was suggested adhd could explain racing thoughts and such, so I went in for assessment. This was just an intro appt. There are further appointments (haven't even filled out the questionnaire she gave me yet) so no diagnosis has come... however... 

After some initial questions during the hour, she said it's more likely I'm on the autism spectrum (or both? But she seemed to lean towards 'not adhd and defo on the spectrum).

She cited eye contact - which I don't have a problem with I just often look away when in thinking mode.
She cited my hand position.
She cited my withdrawness (xanax? I've been sad lately?)
She cited my self admitted engineering brain (I'm a systems engineer) and my capacity to research something till I'm blue in the face.

Adhd made sense to me. Autism does not. My heart dropped when I heard it, and I don't know what to make of it or how to process it, especially while I await further assessment.

No one else in the family has had such a thing.

How have I gotten thru years of therapy or a year with a psychiatrist with no one ever implying anything remotely close to it?

How do I tell my SO? She's going to treat me differently from this point on.

I've seen severe autism. I've also seen mild/high functioning (work with some) and I don't see myself at all.

I've been reading for a few hours now and about the only thing I can see a correlation with is emotional sensitivity.

I don't fear change. I crave it. I love meeting new people. Zero problems sparking up conversation with strangers (or at least it feels like it? )

They have no flavor and taste like pee water half the time and don’t get you buzzed or drunk and they make you pee a lot.  You can drink 4 and not feel drunkish

I enjoy IPA and lagers and other beers because they’re usually higher in alcohol content so they have about 7%+ most of the time so you can drink one and feel content and buzzed. They also have more flavor and are genuinely enjoyable to drink.

My favorite at the moment is voodoo ranger 9.5% Fruit haze (the ones in the orange can) because they taste good, and one can will get you nice and buzzed for a while. So you spend less money, drink less to get the same buzz as drinking about 3-4 regular light beers and they don’t give you hang overs because they don’t have much sugar.

Is this just an autistic mindset ? I think about consuming alcohol very objectively. If I have the option between a light beer and water I’d rather drink just water.

How do you feel about this? (If you drink of course, if you don’t I understand)

Update: seems like most of you don’t really enjoy drinking but for the few that do they seem to enjoy hard ciders and lagers and fruity mixed drinks or a form of gin or vodka.

Backstory: I’m from the U.K. but fled to the US with the help of a friend, then Canada where I can legally work, have dual citizenship. 

I asked my family for advice about my legal rights to keep my job & how to, instead was sent a lot of stuff about how I’m never going to change & they should get power of attorney over me.
I was upset because I was only asking how to keep my job with my current ill health that is treatable with surgery, as I don’t know a lot about canada & its laws, but they are often manipulative like this. I wasn’t sure whether they were referring to my autistic diagnosis. I also got that recently. 

Whilst I’m grateful to have it instead of having a personality disorder put on me & the stigma that carried, I’m also worried how it can be weaponised against me, especially by people like them. I fled the U.K. because they were planning that before. I’m a functional person that just ideally wants some accommodations and is temporarily ill. My therapist told me to keep in touch with them because they give me a small amount of money each month I put into savings & that would help me get independence from them. But I’m worried about the potential influence they can try to wield, especially with my diagnosis. Most of my family are in the U.K. but some are in Canada. 

My uncle had Down’s syndrome and I’m noticing a lot of parallels with the way he was treated & I have been. He was put in many homes & his family acted like they were martyrs because of him. He was never given his own voice & agency. The number of times I’ve been told “why aren’t you like our martyr mother” & have my reality twisted like I’m a terrible person & they’re victims is ridiculous & hurtful. Don’t have children if you’re expecting them to be a certain person.

In addition to AuDHD, I also have OCD and *maybe* BPD. I'm in different subs for both of those illnesses, know people with those illnesses, follow other people on social media with those illnesses, and so on and so forth -- and I've picked up a common trend:

A general frustration with how ""neurodivergent"" has largely become synonymous with ""autistic / ADHD,"" and how autistic and ADHD people have effectively made ""neurotypical"" to mean ""allistic"" (i.e., not autistic) and / or ""doesn't have ADHD.""

Obviously this isn't our *intention*. I've seen lots of people, when the subjects are brought up, point out that things like depression, GAD, etc, are also neurodivergent.

Unfortunately, though, just because something isn't intending to be harmful doesn't mean that it isn't. Our continuous equation of ""neurotypical = this person who doesn't have autism"" is inevitably accusing a **whole** lot of people of being neurotypical when they aren't whatsoever.

Another issue I've seen related to our overuse is that I've actually seen a *lot* of autistic people be confused over why they don't find it easier to get along with ""neurodivergent"" people when they're referencing experiences with allistic individuals. 

The reason is that the studies they're thinking of note that we have an easier time of getting along with **other autistic people**, not neurodivergent people.

(That also isn't a given. Just as allistic people don't get along with all other allistic people, autistic people don't get along with all other autistic people.)

""Neurodivergency"" covers a wide array of diagnoses. It's depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, C-/PTSD, narcissistic personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, OCD -- it's literally every single mental illness known to humanity, right along with developmental disorders that affect the brain's pathways, and so on and so forth.

Someone who is diagnosed with PTSD (for example) is not going to get your behaviors and mindsets that ultimately stem from your autism. They *might* even be dicks about it.

That doesn't mean they're neurotypical -- it means they're allistic.

183,AutisticAdults,2023-05-20 03:29:28,Kleecarim,I feel like my diagnosis is invalid,"Hi,

I was diagnosed about half a year ago, after being told multiple times that I probably am on the spectrum but my symptoms probably won't be enough to qualify for a diagnosis. When I went to get diagnosed, the test results (multiple computer tests, some questionnaires my parents had to fill out, multiple for me and some other tests I don't know how to describe that dealt with reading facial expressions) basically barely scratched the mark to be enough for a diagnosis (I am talking if the required ""points"" were e.g. 30, I scored 31). The person that tested me basically asked me if I wanted to have the diagnosis or not (maybe she asked if I accept it, and she asks everyone, but I don't believe that tbh).

This makes it very hard for me to feel valid, as every time I mention to someone that I am autistic I feel like I have to add that I am not ""that"" autistic because I fear that I invalidate other people's struggles since I probably often pass as NT. I have a hard time in social situations, but on the other hand there are lots of symptoms I don't experience, or at least not in the severity many other autistic people do. For example, I don't think I ever had a meltdown, the closest thing I experienced to that is getting overwhelmed a lot when there are too many noises around me, but usually I can still function. I also struggle in social situations, especially when it's with people I want to get to know better, but smalltalk and other meaningless interactions (e.g. with cashiers) work just fine for me, and I don't think people notice I am ""different"" in those settings. Plus, I feel like a lot of the ""symptoms"" I experience became more severe in the last 2-3 years, when I started questioning whether or not I am autistic, so I am not sure if I am subconsciously amplifying them.

Another thing on my mind is the worry that those symptoms are caused by my diagnosed adhd. 

I don't really know what my aim with that post is, maybe I want to hear that I am valid from other people (probably not just maybe), maybe I just want to know if people can relate, or maybe I just want to know if other autistic people are okay with me claiming to be autistic even though I don't suffer from it as much.

I received my diagnosis in part due to symptoms of burnout that I was experiencing and they truly have not improved, and even gotten much worse after being fired. It was a relief at first, of course, but it’s led to a lot of problems now.

I’m at a point where I’m feeling totally powerless over my life in a way I haven’t ever felt before. I also have the ultimatum of needing to find work before the end of July or having to move in with my parents because they can’t provide more assistance, which is totally understandable on their end so no hard feelings, but it’s simultaneously such a deeply scary thought.

I’m genuinely looking for any method folks have found helpful in motivating themselves again and healing, or any advice on my situation from your perspective/experience. Words of comfort/solidarity also appreciated, 

Thank you so much for reading, I appreciate it!",9,22,22,0.97,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13memaw')>,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/13memaw/dealing_with_burnout_finding_work/,False

193,AutisticAdults,2023-05-19 18:10:59,purpleblueskys,How do I be friends/friendly with a neighbour who is trying to convert me? Or how do I respond to the ungrateful things she is saying?,"Cw: weponizing  a god for me not to take medication.


I moved here 16 months ago at the height of the pandemic. I am m29 and married to a man.

I helped out an elderly neighbour with some work this summer and refused payment (it took 10 minutes, and I had the tools already). 

She then proceeded to invite me to church. I told her I wasn't interested. She then did what I now realize is intake to prove I need Jesus. I am not against just not curious. During her information, she asked many invasive questions without allowing me to do the same. It was one-sided and power trippy. She asked about my work, which I don't because I am trying to get on disability. She wondered why. I have 5+ diagnoses which don't allow me to work. She asked me how many pills I take. She asked me if I was married and to what gender. She asked me about my family life. It just went on. 

Because she told me she works at the hospital, I answered all the questions because I was taught that people working there are in a position to help. I did not use my best judgment, and she took advantage of that.

She calls my male spouse a wife and says I must work and attend church. She says we are friends and not a married couple, even when I correct her.

She is weaponizing her god to tell me not to take my meds and that everything will be okay if I don't and do attend church. 

I know I shouldn't talk to her, but she lives four doors down in the row house complex and is on the board and is always out walking like we are. 

I need to have an adult conversation with her to tell her I won't be coming to church, and she needs not question my relationship with my spouse. 

How do I do this? What do I say? I don't want this to escalate by avoidance.

Eta she is waiting for me to text her a time when I can go in June.

Eta part two: we are part of the same small HOA, and I would like her as an ally.

Eta part three: please only give recommendations on how to converse with HER; I am not interested in bringing anyone else into this or being passive it's not my style and if I don""t talk to her, it will fester inside me.",47,38,38,0.91,0,<bound method VotableMixin.downvote of Submission(id='13m37jb')>,/r/AutisticAdults/comments/13m37jb/how_do_i_be_friendsfriendly_with_a_neighbour_who/,False
194,AutisticAdults,2023-05-19 18:04:53,,Well it’s finally happened.. infantilising behaviour from others,"So I’m newly diagnosed, still in the process of acceptance and realising where I’ve masked etc

In the midst of this little journey, I’ve discovered that I now get quite offended by the ignorance towards autism, despite being almost just as ignorant myself prior to my assessment. I consider myself extremely resilient to most things, especially verbal, but am learning that this is all likely due to the mask I’ve cultivated over the years so as not to seem “sensitive”. 

All of a sudden though, as I’m more comfortable talking about being autistic and what it’s like for me etc I’m finding some shitty people are more comfortable with almost mocking me and making out like I’m suddenly less capable because of my diagnosis? These are people I’ve worked with for four years that never knew anything and now all of a sudden have forgotten that I can and will absolutely knock someone the fuck out for being disrespectful if pushed too far. (I’m very aware violence isn’t the answer but where I grew up conditioned me to be desensitised to it and it became a necessary survival skill as a teen).

Anyway.. what gives? Why do people who have known me for years suddenly think that a diagnosis means I can’t defend myself or that there’s now permission to try and mock me when prior to my diagnosis, they wouldn’t dare? I’m not trying to make myself out to be someone particularly dangerous etc or some sort of violence advocate, moreso trying to stress the point that it’s as though everybody allistic got a memo saying that I’m now an easy target because I’m autistic, and yet, I’ve ALWAYS been autistic and in adulthood nobody has ever thought to try it.
