I am 4-6 weeks into brintellix for depression (I'm on venlafaxin for anxiety).

I know it is supposed to take weeks if not months to feel a difference, but every day has been filled with dread, constant self hate, low energy, bad mood, and just wanting to end my life. If anything depression is worse than before and have even less energy to fight.

On top of that, I have gained 20lbs since started brintellix, and I worry if I don't stop this medication then I will be depressed and overweight. I can feel myself having a strong negative mental reaction to being overweight, which I think in itself is something to understand (why do I feel this way?).

What I haven't been able to do is really take anything I learn in therapy to help myself outside of the 24hr window after therapy. My brain is so fuzzy that I struggle to remember the tools I have learned and it feels like I haven't grown at all and am in the same spot as years ago. So I get caught in the whirlwind and spin out.

I started watching (haven't finished) the Jonah Hill netflix special about his therapist, who uses some drawing/visualization techniques (in the therapy session at least) and I felt inspired. I am thinking of having physical things to remind me of different tools to use - either like actual objects/jewelry or drawing/non-permanent tattoo/stickers. 

So for reddit I ask this:

1. What are your ''tools'' / techniques for working through feelings in the moment?
2. Do you have any physical/visualized objects/techniques to remind yourself? Or if not, how do you remember them? Or jolt yourself out of a moment to remember that you even have tools?

I expect not every technique works for everyone, and that everyone struggles with different depression and anxiety challenges, but I appreciate any shared thoughts.

I never look forward to being with her. Our relationship and fights are what pushes me into depression, though I’m sure I would be miserable anyway. We have tried couples therapy and I think we need more help but she doesn’t want to go to more. I really want a divorce.

But wait! We have a 3 year old, and both live abroad temporarily and both come from different countries. So if we split up, there’s no clear way we can both be with our child unless we continue living abroad, which I know she will not want. And maybe we can’t afford to live apart either. Neat!

My fiancé and I are both disabled, mainly in huge part to our mental health. But these past couple months we’ve had some positive changes happening around our life and more to come. Mainly along the lines of finally being able to make a more accommodating apartment space that could potentially help us a whole lot with daily functioning. 

I know during the Winter people tend to feel depression symptoms going up. But I don’t know if it’s just that for me. Because every time I have things going on, I think about people that aren’t around in my life anymore and it just pushes me further into depression. 

My father walked out on me as a teen and I often think where he is in life and when I have things going on, what he would think of me. My grandmother passed away 4 years ago, before I had any semblance of stability and so I often wish I could share this life I’ve been building with her. I think about friends that just aren’t around. And more recently having to distance myself from the rest of my family, and so I think a lot about how I can’t share any of my life with them. For my own sanity, trust me, it’s best not to. 

I’m also neurodivergent and I struggle immensely with building relationships and making friends. So when I have a lot of changes happening, it quickly feels isolating and lonely because I genuinely don’t have anyone I can share it with. I’m part of a small community on Instagram, and a lot of my internet friends are always happy to hear what’s going on, but it’s more of passing updates. It’s never full conversations about my life or theirs. Not anymore. All the friends I used to have that used to know everything about my life, don’t want to be in my life anymore.

What I wasn’t expecting though is that in that time I was going to create more problems for myself later. I’ve always struggled on and off with dry scalp and dandruff. I’ve changed my shampoo and shampooing routine more times than I can count. It didn’t occur to me that not showering often enough for an extended period was going to cause extremely stubborn build up on my scalp. 

At this point it’s led to my hair falling out. And the worst part is it’s BARELY motivating me to wash it more frequently. I’ve switched to more natural products and have bought this specific scalp scrubber, and also have been doing oil treatments. I think I’d be seeing quicker progress if I could stick to being consistent with it. I even cut off all my hair to make things easier. 

It just sucks. It brings up feelings of me being a failure in some way because there’s this awful in my face physical evidence that I can’t take care of myself well enough.

Hey everyone, I'm 27, in college, and I have major depressive disorder, PTSD, and anxiety disorder. 5 years ago, I was able to hold a job, I was in college, and I had stability. I decided to quit work, and my wife and I went to school together. 
I'm still in school, after failing a few classes and being unable to keep up with the course work, I tried to calm the school thing down and go part time and work part time. Well, 5 jobs this year and I haven't managed to keep a hold of one for over a month. I have panic attacks that are so bad that I faint or throw up. And it's just over leaving the house. I've tried to relax, tried to find outlets with friends and I can't even manage that these days. My wife is super supportive, and kind. She understands, but I feel like I'm letting her down by failing so much at what I set out to do. I'm an artist, and haven't even sat down to paint or draw in months. 
This decline has happened over the course of a year, I'm feeling worse and worse about myself, I'm terrified I'm going to lose financial aid, and that we'll be homeless. I feel so hopeless and worthless.
I don't have insurance, and there's no counselor or therapist that's free out here that's equipped to handle someone like me, I've tried the only free resource out here. 
I genuinely don't know what started this decline in my mental state. Idk if it's just childhood trauma coming to a head, if that's the case why it started now, or how to even get out of it. I need advice and resources to resolve this...

i was referred to a local mental health team but it has been months and it is so difficult to talk to anyone. they call me and either i miss the call or i'm really not prepared for the call so i don't answer. i call back and they are either engaged or i speak to a receptionist and nobody is available and they will call me back but it takes hours and i do not feel like talking at that point. i asked if i could communicate with them via email but apparently the receptionist can't give out any emails because the person who has the email address would have to agree. i was thinking of writing a letter but i'm worried they will just tell me to call. i am okay with appointments where i have to see someone because i see that as a situation where i have to be in a room and at least something will happen (and i have practiced this way of thinking with seeing the doctor and it has worked. i am still polite and don't say how bad things really are but i have written things down and have spoken more than i ever have - but my doctor changed and my new doctor has basically referred me to this mental health team and said they are just their for medication reviews so the one place i started to feel relatively comfortable talking feels closed off).

Since then, going into my twenties…I have had friends, boyfriends, girlfriends, jobs, etc. But nothing ever sticks. Everyone goes away in the end. Every job I have, I quit. I’m not good at anything and so it’s hard for me to find joy in working. I’m a college dropout despite being academically intelligent. But even so, I feel like a complete failure.

In terms of friendships, I always seem to befriend the wrong people. Most of my friends never actually cared about me. They were all drug addicts and drug taxers. I’ve had “friends” steal from me, lie to me and generally I always get abandoned or ghosted eventually. This has caused me to develop severe trust and abandonment issues. Also those “friends” actually got me hooked on drugs and alcohol for several years.

When it comes to romantic relationships, I’m bisexual and have had success in having some long term relationships. However I’ve cheated on almost everyone I’ve ever been with. I don’t know why, likely the fear of being vulnerable. The fear of being abandoned. But every time I’ve done it. I tell the person immediately after and break things off. Because I have a massive guilty conscience and hate lying to people.

I have also physically abused some of the people I’ve dated (grabbing them by the shirt or chest, pushing them. I’ve never punched them or anything like that). It’s like I have two personalities…I can be kind, empathetic, gentle, supportive, well adjusted. But I have a horrible temper and a compulsion to destroy things. When people make me angry everything becomes a blur. Only for me to just “snap” out of it. I’m either a kind hearted gentle person or an extremely violently angry person. It’s like there’s no in between.

When I’m angry, I lash out to an extreme length. I’ve thrown things at walls and yell so loudly that many of my partners are genuinely terrified of me in the moment. Almost two years ago, I got into a horrible fight with my now ex fiancé. It’s somewhat difficult to explain but I pushed him, he fell back and as he did; one of my fingernails scratched the top of his forehead. For weeks afterwards he had a large scratch on his head. The guilt of that killed me on the inside and it still does.

Two years later, out of emotionally crippling guilt I got back into contact with my exes that I have physically and verbally abused. To just have some form of closure and again sincerely apologize for the bad things I’ve done. To my amazement and disbelief, they all forgave me. They all genuinely don’t think I’m a bad person and they think that my explosive temper is some sort of trauma response. However I feel that I don’t deserve their forgiveness. 

I began to realize that self harming stopped my explosive temper. If I lash out at myself first, I can’t lash out at other people. So I cut my left arm almost every night with a razor blade because it snaps me out of my negative state without hurting other people.

Since I am on the topic of romantic relationships, my sex life has been nonexistent. It’s actually incredibly difficult for me to have sex. It takes me a very long time to even be comfortable with somebody before I have sex with him. And it’s incredibly common for me to start having a panic attack just before having sex. I hyperventilate and start shaking violently. 

And what’s even worse is that I’ve never have dated or been with anybody that has ever comforted me during one of these episodes. I just have to get over it myself and wait it out. More often than not my romantic partner(s) are annoyed by it instead of empathizing with me. Which has really affected my self-esteem and sexual confidence 

Last year I was also involved in a horrible car accident and was nearly killed. I almost died from blood loss that was due to an injury on my left arm. And yes when I cut myself, I do cut my left arm with the razor blade specifically because it reminds me of the car accident. I’m not sure why I do that but I do.

The accident was quite traumatic for me and I don’t think I’ve ever been the same since it happened. I don’t feel like the same person anymore and my mental health issues got significantly worse since it happened to me.

The fact that my exes have forgiven me gives me the tiniest amount of hope that maybe I am a good person and there is some sort of redeemable quality in me. I feel like a horrible failure of a person that’s failed in every aspect of their life. And I don’t blame anyone reading this for hating me as well.

And yes while I have gone through some trauma that’s no excuse for my poor behavior in the past. I don’t think I will ever be able to forgive myself and honestly I think I deserve my suffering. I often think about suicide because I think that’s what I deserve. I don’t see any other way out. I’ve gone to therapy for 10 years, I’ve been on every anti-depressant and antipsychotic medication on the market. I just don’t know what else to do.


Honestly, why would anybody want to be my friend? Why would anybody want to have me as a girlfriend or wife? When you’ve done the things that I have done and have experienced the things that I have experienced. How can I ever be honest with somebody without being terrified of them hurting or leaving me?",0,2,2,1.0,0,,/r/depression/comments/13t497j/f27_i_feel_like_a_complete_failure/,True,False

I was on 75mg of Effexor which didn’t do much and also found out I my parents didn’t want to pay for healthcare. I’m a 20 year old women so I was able to be on it for another 5 years. Upon finding this out this means no more therapy because it was going to be $67 out of pocket and another $70 for the meds. Money is tight so I decided to go cold turkey with the help of some “trees” So far it’s been pretty hellish going through withdraw but I’m wondering what I did was wrong and if maybe paying the extra $300 (i use to go to therapy twice a month) was worth going through the withdrawal. I really didn’t want to have to depend on the meds so much but things were getting mentally tough at the beginning of this year. I haven’t been able to talk to anyone about this who really can give much feedback because my parents think taking medication is bs anyway and my bf offered to pay for it but we really don’t have the money for it (plus getting healthcare in my state is nearly impossible unless you have kids) I know he just wants what’s best for me but I really want to get off this stuff and be able to sort things out with out the meds. If I do feel like I’m going to hurt myself or feel bad I will go back to the therapy and meds. Just right now I don’t think I’m able to with my current situation.

I feel like she has her life more together than me. I always was a person that needs more time for everything and I struggled a lot in life - like a lot of mental health issues, a family on my mom’s side that was very dysfunctional to the point it even affected us sometimes due to my mom being traumatized by them, struggling in school/university/relationships… 


I‘m also in the process of getting diagnosed for ADHD (inattentive type) because up until 2020 I was an even huger mess. I was able to finish university and get a job, but ever since then I felt so empty. I also had a lot of sexual abuse trauma in my life. Because of the last encounter, I didn‘t have a partner in 7 years, because my self esteem is so low. Despite 5 years of therapy (3 different types), a psychiatric daily clinic stay, medication etc. I never got over it fully. I was diagnosed with Avoidant personality disorder at age 22.


Now that my friend is marrying soon, I‘m reminded once again how much I don‘t live up to anyone. I‘ll get asked why I haven‘t married yet.


I can‘t tell anyone it‘s because I think I‘m too ugly and unworthy for that. I can’t tell anyone the aspect of someone touching me or seeing me in vulnerable moments makes me nauseous. I only told my therapist about it but my therapy ended in 2022… It‘s embarrassing and pathetic. I truly believe it though. I‘ve completly shut myself off. I‘ve felt disconnected from my feelings for the past year now.


Work keeps me busy but I‘m so bad at doing stuff by myself. Organizing things, managing money etc. is so hard for me. It takes too much energy… If it was up to me, I‘d just want to live on a small farm or small forest house, have some animals and live a life without anyone. 


I tell people I‘m not interested in a relationship and honestly 90% of the time I‘m not. I feel too overwhelmed with my daily life to care about another person and most people around me are very superficial regarding looks. But the fact that I‘m the only single friend in my entire circle makes me so self concious… It makes me feel inadequate


Anything I achieved seems irrelevant. It doesn‘t matter that I struggled through university yet still graduated, I think it‘s worthless and anyone can do it.

I have had severe depression for years now and for the vast majority of it I have been on medication. I can’t explain why but my for a lot of my life I have been lying about so much about so many things simply to have others either not worry about me or not think down of me. This can range from stuff when I was a teenager in school to present day in my adult life. The major way I have been coping with my depression recently is use of alcohol and marijuana. It usually comes in spikes (?) where I drink/smoke heavily for a couple days. I think really the only reason why I stop is because after a few days my body hurts far too much. For a few months now I have stop taking my medication completely and seeing my psychiatrist/therapist. Full on ghosted them. The reality of why I did this is I have put myself into debt through these habits and at the time I chose to use my income for more self destructive habits than actual treatment.

Was working well for managing both. Depression came back (constant suicide ideation, spinning out) due to a period of higher stress, and I decided to up my dose to 225mg, as I was out of town and not able to see my doctor or therapist and didn’t know what else to do. After 4 weeks on 225mg I feel better than I did on 150mg, better at managing social situations and depressive episodes, though it may also be because the high stress period is gone. I saw my doctor finally and she said I should not go above 150mg (effect of the drug is not much higher but side effects would be much higher) and instead prescribed another medication to complement venlafaxin for depression. 

But given that I feel better on 225mg…I kind of want to stay on this dosage for longer and not add another drug. Talking more with her is probably the best move, instead of just not listening and taking 3x75mg and not 150mg + the new medication.

We live abroad away from family so don't really have any help taking care of our son. All that is to say I find my normal responsibilities tend to fill my time and am generally bad about making time for myself, though I do get some hours here and there for hobbies.

  
Last year I started taking medication for anxiety and depression (which in retrospect I have had my entire life. Neat!) and seeing a therapist. I went on sick leave due to ongoing anxiety attacks about a new job, and suffered the usual dreading waking up everyday and seeing no point in life. You know, the usual. Eventually I changed jobs and along with the medication and therapy got past the anxiety.

For the first time in years, I now have a week off to myself (wife and kid are visiting family and I'm on vacation), and I find it impossible to plan something fun to do by myself. Usually I am so overwhelmed being around other people that I keep imagining I will go off on a hiking trip by myself and just get away from everyone. 

But when it comes down to planning a trip, even just a day trip, I get tunnel vision and have trouble focusing and generally feel short of breath and overwhelmed. I'm so uncertain and overwhelmed about where to go, what gear I should buy (and should I even buy gear for a one or two time thing), if I actually want to go on a trip, what I even want to do. And I am so afraid of making the wrong choice, that I just don't choose. And then my whole ''deal'' of wanting to get away from everyone is revealed to be an obtainable fantasy, or just not really what I want. And then the question is what do I want to do with the precious free time I have.

This is pretty typical for me planning ANYTHING, that I either waste my time in indecision, or give up. Generally my wife does all the planning, and I can help her make decisions...but when it comes to myself I'm hopeless.

Maybe it means that I need to plan something with a friend, but for just this once I don't want to have be following what someone else wants to do, or needing to ask for help or borrow gear or...maybe its unrealistic given it's something I've never done before.

I’m planning on writing these down and giving it to my psychiatrist in my next visit. I desperately feel alone and want to know if anyone experiences these issues. 
__

In the middle of a conversation I will just zone out. I get quiet and feel a lost of energy and just want to be alone and notice I start speaking very quietly basically like whispering. I don’t know why this happens

I seem to always make things about myself in conversations it’s the only way I know how to relate but my friends have noticed and they say it’s quite annoying 


I take a lot of things literal and don’t know when someone is serious or joking 

Everyone says my humor isn’t funny and quite confusing, I guess the way I see things are very different to others.

I find it so hard to do simple things. My room can never stay organized. First, it takes me ages to bring myself to clean and then a few days later it’s suddenly messy again and it’s just an ongoing cycle. The problem is I see the mess and I really want to clean up but I can’t bring myself to do it. And when I finally do it , it makes me feel so exhausted. L

I can be very decisive and impulsive. My friends have mentioned a lot how I say things without thinking and sometimes it’s blunt and quite rude. 

I also forget what I had just said like a minute before moving on to another topic. 

I have trouble recognizing people’s facial expressions and tones. Sometimes I can’t tell whether people are happy or upset with me. And people always say it’s hard to interact with me because the things I say they never know if I’m joking or serious because my facial expressions and tone are out of sync.


I go through so many phases of hyper focusing on things and it’s something I can’t stop thinking about until I wind up losing interest. And I ramble on about it and talk about it as much as I can with friends and family. It’s quite embarrassing but I can’t help myself.

When I get excited I flap my hands and jump up and down. I know it looks childish so I try not to. 

When I’m stressed I need to fidget with my fidget toys but they don’t seem to help much. The way I can explain it is that I feel like I have electricity running through me and there’s no way to let it out. I feel irritable a lot of the time because I don’t know how to explain how it feels inside my body and brain. 



Sometimes I randomly feel like I need to cry  

Big crowds overwhelm me, not because I’m scared of people it just feels like too much going on around me with noise,  lights and people. 

I like to plan things ahead of time. I don’t like when plans are changed.

I get attached to people so easily like a child and I hate it so much

It’s very hard for me to finish any assignment up until the last minute. No matter if I enjoy it or don’t the only thing that pushes me is until the last few minutes it’s due.

I go from one extreme to the other. For example I can be very excited to extremely disappointed. If I get critiqued on something I go and do the complete opposite I don’t know how to be balanced. 

I find it hard to follow instructions with more than one step involved, unless clearly laid out in written form. I require everyone to be very clear with me, otherwise I won't feel able to complete a task.

Now I am currently back on the place where all of this happened in 2019 and I find myself having obsessive thoughts about my plane crashing or my parents dying before I can get home to see them. My parents are fine BTW. 

I feel like my fear is different from other fearful flyers because I don't worry about turbulence or other things, it's like my brain is telling me all the time that I am the target of a disaster and these thoughts are so intense I can't distinguish my fear from reality. I worry that I am for some reason chosen to be killed on a crash and there's nothing about plane safety that makes me nervous, but the fact that I have convinced myself that I am the target to die. 

I have had a long battle with health anxiety and anxiety but right now I feel like I am set years back, it feels like I am back in 2019. I need help, please. I cannot reach my therapist who is on vacation until next week.

I found it almost impossible to answer calls or texts with one after another. I can't explain it, I just panic and think I should reply when I'm feeling less crazy, which starts the cycle of ""I'll feel better when I reply.....I'll reply when I feel better"" and I just wind up ghosting people. I totally dropped off of social media around 2016 as well, I panic just thinking about it.

I had an abortion summer last year, and although I was confident in my decision I still feel overwhelming guilt (raised catholic lol). I didn't know how to talk to my best friend about it so I ghosted her about a year ago. 

Every single day I feel deeply ashamed and scared that I've ruined these relationships forever. Nightmares of my friends I abandoned at least a few times a week.

several times a night, i will check on my two dogs and my partner to make sure they’re all breathing. this causes my sleeping issues to get even worse. i can’t sleep until i’m exhausted enough to forget the possibility of them dying. 

if i don’t know what someone’s doing (mom, dad, brother), i worry something VERY bad has happened. i can’t focus on anything else until i’m sure they’re okay. which can get hard when my brother and i don’t really speak, but i still care about him very much. with my parents, i can always call them. 

i just need some advice. i’m so sick of constantly being worried someone/my dogs are going to die. it’s really ruining the time i do have with these people.

10,15,Anxiety,2023-05-27 11:00:20,ToyLollipop,Anxiety ruins the relationship with my family (thoughts of suicide),"Yesterday, we had to celebrate children's day earlier. I decided to come at the place where it celebrated together with my mom. We arrived and I saw lots of children and teens there. It was a stadium where the celebration had place. I wanted to come there because maybe I could meet someone, but apparently, I wasn't prepared. There was someone who invited me to stay next to them. I did, but I never talked because I feared to say something stupid. My mom eventually called me and told me there were some exclassmates I could go and talk to. I couldn't find them. I was too afraid to see someone that I could accidentally make eye contact. I saw lots of people I know having fun and I had the feeling that I didn't know what to do. I only wanted to crouch and cry. (I know that people don't have any problems with me, but I can't stop the thoughts of people who look at me and call me a loser or a weirdo. I always think that every move I do will lead to harsh concequences. I shouldn't view life like that, yet I hate myself for not stopping. It was my fault for being a crybaby and acting jealous at school anyway. No one thought of me as a great person because of that, and so I tried to perfect myself as much as possible, and I still think I'm not enough.)

My mom saw me do that. Usually when I have panick attacks, my mom would try to confort me, but that time she got angry, took my arm and forced me to go home. She would tell me all the time we were walking home about the fact that she is tired of waiting for me to finally open up, to talk to people. She is tired to see me stay quiet. She saw me staying with that girl and told me ""she invited you to stay and talk to her, yet you didn't say anything like a stupid bitch"", telling me that I need to go to a psychiatrist (to be honest, I wouldn't mind that, but of course she won't take me to one because she thinks I don't actually need one). One thing that made me feel like killing myself is that she bans me from talking to a friend of mine, who I have a lot in common with because ""you literally sold your soul for that friendship and you wouldn't talk to anyone else."" I think of it as a hypocritical move because she was the one who recommended me to talk to the person in the first place.

I thought that my mom has changed because she finally observed that I suffer. I guess I was mistaken. She wouldn't listen to me anymore. When my dad heard of this, he got pissed on my mom and reminded her of my heart condition and that her behaviour leads us to nothing. He then accused her for breaking my arm (which it wasn't even broken). Later, my dad asked me about what happened after we left from the stadium. Then he told me that my behaviour is mainly influenced of my internet activity, that he'll throw away my gadgets. I was always afraid that they will probably end up divorcing because of me. My mom told me several years ago that they mostly fight because of me.

I am afraid of becoming any of my parents. I don't want to become like my mother because of her manipulative tendencies (that I recently discovered) and I don't want to become like my dad, who's overly protective. At this point I don't know if I should kill myself or not because I've got no one. Yet I'm too afraid of death. I can't even get proper help. Maybe when I'll finally have my own life, things will get better.

Comparative with the anxiety I have right now, I am now better since I can talk with other people and express myself (at least used to) than when I was smaller.

What I mean is, for example, I work at a music venue. A huge, very long music venue. It takes about 10 minutes to walk from one side to the other. If I'm leading my crew to do a job, or taking a group of new hires to do some training and I am in front of the group, it feels like I have forgotten how to walk. My right leg feels paralyzed while my left leg goes completely loose and feels like it's flopping around. I don't know what to do with my hands and arms even if I'm holding something, so they normally stay stiffly at my side while I try to move them occasionally on purpose. I also don't know where to look while I'm walking, so I'm either awkwardly staring at the ground so much that I go off course or run into something, or just awkwardly darting my head around to stare at random objects until I feel like I don't look weird anymore.

I've experienced this for years but I have finally realized how exhausting this is and am wondering if anyone has any tips or tricks to soothe this when it happens.

I started a new construction job this week, it is in a remote area and for a good company. In this industry due to high risk nature of work we are subjected to random drug and alcohol tests to make sure we are fit for the dangerous environment.

I started on the same day as another guy who is the same age as me. We are discussing the random drug and alcohol tests. 

I mentioned that in my previous company I failed a drug and alcohol test. I tested positive for cannabis after smoking a couple of joints on my birthday and getting tested when I returned to site. 

I told him I regret it massively and don't smoke any more as a result. 

That seemed fine, we continued talking about drugs and drug experiences.  He mentioned that he sometimes enjoys cocaine sparingly.

I told him I no longer take any stimulants after being sold Crystal Meth when I tried to purchase MD. This seemed fine at the time as well, he asked what it was like, if I stayed up for days etc.

However since then (three days ago) he is acting much more distant with me. We were forced to ride together in the car today and he started complaining about people failing drug tests and telling crazy stories in the work place.

I was taken aback, I thought my stories were appropriate given the topic of discussion was drugs and he mentioned doing cocaine. I told them in the spirit of being honest about who I am and my experiences in life.

I have read some research materials, and it appears that the main mechanism of healing is achieved by taking propranolol approximately one hour before retrieving a disturbing memory. It is believed that during the active period of the medication, the emotional response associated with the memory is either removed or reduced when the memory is reconsolidated.
  

  
Does anyone have any experience with this? What are your thoughts on whether this could be a viable approach to healing?
  

  
Thanks in advance!
  

  
PS: Also I'm also adding ChatGPT response below on this matter:
  

  
**How propranolol can be used to heal ptsd and heal negative emotional response from memories?**
  

  
*Propranolol is a medication primarily used to treat conditions such as high blood pressure, angina (chest pain), and certain heart rhythm disorders. While it is not approved by regulatory authorities as a specific treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), some studies have explored its potential use in reducing the emotional intensity associated with traumatic memories.*
  

  
*The concept behind using propranolol for PTSD is based on the idea that the drug may interfere with the process of memory reconsolidation, which is the stabilization and re-storage of memories when they are recalled. By administering propranolol shortly after a traumatic event or during the recollection of traumatic memories, the hope is that it may disrupt the emotional response associated with those memories, potentially reducing the intensity of PTSD symptoms.*
  

  
*It's important to note that the use of propranolol for PTSD is still a subject of ongoing research, and its efficacy and safety for this purpose are not yet fully established. The results from studies have been mixed, and more research is needed to determine its long-term effects, optimal dosing, and potential benefits and risks.*
  

  
**What might be the mechanism of propranolol healing effect with regard to memory reconsolidation**
  

  
*The exact mechanism by which propranolol may affect memory reconsolidation is not fully understood. However, there are a few proposed theories regarding its potential healing effects on traumatic memories and emotional responses:*
  

  
*Noradrenergic modulation: Propranolol is a beta-blocker that primarily acts by blocking beta-adrenergic receptors. One theory suggests that traumatic memories and their associated emotional responses involve heightened activity in the noradrenergic system, which is involved in the stress response. By blocking beta-adrenergic receptors, propranolol may reduce the release of norepinephrine, a stress hormone, and thereby interfere with the emotional consolidation of traumatic memories.*
  

  
*Disruption of memory reconsolidation: When memories are recalled, they enter a labile state known as reconsolidation, during which they are susceptible to modification or disruption. Propranolol, when administered around the time of memory retrieval, may interfere with the reconsolidation process, weakening the emotional intensity associated with the memory. This disruption may lead to a reduction in the negative emotional response to the memory over time.*
  

  
*Contextual memory impairment: Another proposed mechanism is that propranolol may impair the contextual memory associated with traumatic events. Contextual memory refers to the details and environmental cues associated with a particular memory. By disrupting the contextual memory, propranolol may weaken the emotional response tied to the traumatic event.*
  

  
*It's important to note that while these theories provide possible explanations for the effects of propranolol on memory reconsolidation, further research is needed to fully understand its mechanisms and confirm its effectiveness in treating PTSD or reducing the emotional impact of traumatic memories.*",0,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/Anxiety/comments/13t2d3c/propranolol_anxiety_and_reconsolidation_of_the/,False,False

So this woman was apparently supposed to be a child psychologist, she studied 2 years of it yet she acts nothing like a decently compassionate and caring parent. She's both emotionally and physically abused me my entire life, instances I don't remember that she for some reason told me and others I can never forget.
When I was a baby, I was pretty chatty according to my family. And I guess I was too chatty for my mom. Because one day she said she got so annoyed with my talking that she punched me hard enough to break my nose. I don't know how that wasn't an instant indicator you weren't ready to raise another human being if you can't even prevent yourself from breaking your baby's nose but alright :) From what I remember she also said she lied about how my nose got broken because idk who would just let that slide.
And then I got older. For the most part she was okay until I started to become more shy and reserved. She always thought something was wrong with me and still does for my sudden change in personality. But by that point she was already becoming abusive and only reason why I assume she did is because of my shift in personality. I was also ""lucky"" enough to be her golden child, I always got amazing grades and behaved well in school and I still do my best to keep that up now just because I'm so used to it. But through that came all the screaming and degrading if I got any grade lower than an A. I've always hated when this woman told me ""Always aim to do your best. If you can get a 90, go for a 95 next time! And next time get 100!"" No. That's nearly impossible please shut up.
But back to her thinking something was wrong with me because I started becoming shy. She took it upon herself to enlist me in school therapy. And that was the worst mistake she could have done and it's what made me realize she was abusing me. I was casually talking to my therapist about some stuff that happens at home and remarked certain things she's done. Like yelling at me, degrading me, throwing objects at me including cleaning liquids. My therapist reasonably got nervous and calls CPS. I got nervous since knowing eventually they would come and told my mom. And my god this woman put on a damn show because she started crying, asking me why I did this to her and if I hate her. Man was I so unaware of what she's done to me it makes me furious now, and she used that to her advantage before. The social worker sadly found nothing wrong. After that, my mom went from being so sad I did this to damning me to hell. She thought I called the social worker, and claimed something like that stays on your record (I really hope it does now) and she told my entire family how I called CPS on her and thank goodness they weren't around that often by then because then it would have gone worse. But sadly I know how that would have gone now.
But I was devastated and this is really where her abuse began to shine towards me.
She immediately took me out of therapy, started to continuously talk me down and make me feel miserable on purpose, and physically abused me constantly. I remember her lifting a chair, about to throw it onto me before I screamed and begged her to leave me alone, but before that she was screaming and yelling at me and my dad was in the same room and did NOTHING until that moment. Which he always does, nothing. And all he did was just tell her to calm down. Same with an instance of her literally choking me, which she did 3 times in total in my life, and my dad was around for 2 of those times and again. Nothing. I had to push her off every single time and lock myself in my room. So yeah, lovely middle school experience. Made my anxiety form and skyrocket and I would have panic attacks every time I thought she'd hurt me.
She then placed me in therapy with a therapist who always took her side. I forgot how I stopped attending that therapy but good fucking riddance I hate that therapist. And then I was placed in therapy to a place closer to our new apartment. Both my therapists there were lovely. Yet the first one had to go. Because she too called CPS after I told her about the second time my mom tried to choke me which was some days before my session, and how my dad did nothing and just told this she beast to relax, as if that's going to do anything. And that time I was hysterical, begging my therapist to not call and I didn't want to go home after she made the call. I was too scared because the last time this happened I got horribly abused. And the same happened. Except this time, my family was strung along. Constantly demanding to talk to me. Constant accusing and belittling from nearly everyone, saying I deserve to feel horrible for what I apparently did because I guess I made the call and wasn't horrified for my life at the thought that I was going to be in a living hell for the next months? All of this for confiding in someone that she fucking choked me, and I'm told I'm the bad guy. Best example is one of my half siblings from my dad's side (because he's left multiple families) and said half sibling comparing her situation to mine, talking up my mom and how great of a parent she is. Even went through my phone to find something?? Idk what because all I do is talk to the little friends I have in there. I tried going to sleep to just constantly hear her ask if I'm still awake and I thought she was going to try understanding me but every time, she would use that to continue to talk shit about me and how horrible and stupid I am. Thanks so much for making my anxiety flare at hearing the words you used to describe me, now I never spoke to you since. So yeah, therapists changed and I regret leaving my most recent one. I loved her a lot and she was very sweet and comforting to me. My mom hated her because she made me feel safe but eventually she has no say in taking me out of therapy because I was an adult and I got to chose when to leave. And leaving therapy was my decision because I was finally getting better. But now it's getting bad again. Since then my mom broke one of my fingers, choked me AGAIN and in front of my sister this time who was paralyzed in fear. I actually had to claw at my mom because pushing her off wasn't enough and she took A PICTURE saying *I* abused her and that she could take me to court for that?? I deleted the picture of course but the audacity she has to physically assault me, I defend myself, and she says I hurt her. And then the most recent things that happened.
She was off on vacation to DR. And it was those times where she was nicest to me. When I was nowhere near her. And then when I came over for my vacation, which I could barely call one because I was busy with college transferring issues and so much emailing and video calls half of the time. Right before we went to a resort my dad was fighting with my sister and then he all of a sudden wanted to include me in it. I got angry and then my mom comes in the room asking me why I'm yelling across the hall to him and I simply said ""You constantly yell at me when we live in an apartment complex where vents are connected to other apartments. People always hear you screaming. But we're in a house, who's going to hear me screaming?"" And she shut up thankfully. Oh yeah and she also mentioned how me and my sister have been ruining our vacation when that was literally the first time we ever ""acted out""? Okay then. And then the day we left back to our city.
An uncle came over and was going to leave as I was just waking up. I was really tired and trying to wake myself up and my mom took that as being rude I guess because after he left she said ""Don't worry, I know how much you hate it here. You're never coming back."" And I got just fed up by that point. I came into her room and was constantly asking her why does she hate me so much? Why does she always assume the worst of me? Why does she think a normal person can simply change their demeanors in a flash like her two faced self?? She just kept telling me I'm insane and crazy and odious, her favorite word to call me. Then eventually I said ""This is why we can never be on the same page. You assume the worst of me and all I do is try and try to fix our relationship as mother and daughter. That therapist you took me to, thinking those kids who bullied me were the problem? Yeah remember she told you, YOU need to get your act together and stop making me feel like shit! What is your problem with me?!"" ""How's about you just stop trying to 'fix' things, because I will never understand you.""
After that, it was the first time I wondered why I was born and thought that if I didn't have friends who cared about me, there would be no reason for me to go on. And I cried. A lot.
And after I calmed down I just decided you know what. Fine.
I'm not talking to her anymore unless I need to bring something up. I'm not going to say hi to her or wish her good night. I'm going to ignore her everytime she's in my room. I can't stand caring about her opinion because if I keep doing that to myself, I'm actually going to kill myself.
But things are going to get better.
Because the university I transferred to is 3/4 hours away from this toxic household. I know I'll be so much happier next semester.
As for my sister, at first I felt guilty leaving her behind. But she's clearly the favorite in both my parents eyes, but especially my mom's. Because she never laid a hand on her. There have been times my dad has hurt me too. But never my sister. I'm not jealous of her, we're very close, as close as siblings could be, as I had to be her emotional and well, parental support because none of our actual parents wanted to do their jobs outside of paying bills and putting food on the table. But at least I don't have to worry about her getting abused while I'm away because it's me my parents want.
I can't wait to move away. And I'm also glad I won't be going back to my parents home country. When it's brought up I'll just say ""No no, remember mom. I 'hated being there'. I 'hate my family and everything around me'. I'm 'odious'. You made it clear and you know what, you're right. I have to focus on my studies in my own country. Reguardless, I don't want to go to a place where my own family would hate me reguardless. If they knew my morals and who I love, they would hate me as much as you hate me and never want to speak to me again. So I'm good, I'd rather stay in a country with people that actually enjoy my company and people who actually want me around. Go have your vacation! :D""
So yeah, this is very long but I had to let this out somewhere since I may not have time for a therapist with my college workload sadly. Or I could look into a counselor from my campus that can do virtual sessions, idk.
Anyways thanks if you read this far. Let me know what you think and if I should do anything else besides ignoring my ""parents"".
From this point forward they're not considered my parents, they're just a woman and man who I have to bare with sharing a living place until I move out.",1,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/x3b1s6/vent_about_my_mom_and_my_thoughts_on_what_to_do/,False,True
1,239,raisedbynarcissists,2022-07-07 01:40:25,SakuraNightGlow,I wish there was a rule to not call CPS if a child is begging you not to.,"This may sound very weird to some people but hopefully most can agree with me; So I have narcissistic and abusive parents. Specifically my mother is the abuser and my dad watched the abuse happen and did nothing to help me and in fact sides with her a couple of times and even did put his hands on me a couple of times.
But basically, CPS has been called to my house twice. Twice, nothing was done. And twice, I was horrendously abused for it and nowadays, there are still moments here and there when it happens. My mom always loves to bring those incidents up about how I ""betrayed her"" as though she didn't do what she's done to me and told my entire family and made them all hate me.
For that, I wish my therapists NEVER called CPS on my household. After those two incidents, they were the worst moments of my life and lowest.
The second time they were called, I was begging to not go home and even tried to call other family members to have me stay over at their place.
In all honesty, if a child is literally begging you not to call CPS, trust me, it's seriously better not to. Not only does CPS barely do anything in most cases, because my mother and most parents in these cases are manipulative, of course they'd get away with what they've done, but in the many cases where no child is taken out of the home, they will be in hell for a good, long while and it will make their situation far, far worse.
Literally the only time that won't happen is if there was a very blown out of proportion misunderstanding and the parents are actually kind and understanding.
This was just a random rant but I hope some people can agree with me on this, because both these instances really riled up my anxiety and made me realize the hard way that my family does not care about me in the slightest.",1,2,2,1.0,0,,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/vt6kjc/i_wish_there_was_a_rule_to_not_call_cps_if_a/,False,True

Both of my parents were extreme narcissists. My mom was covert, so her abuse was more subtle, and my dad was just an asshole and proud of it. It’s been years of therapy and medications. I finally went fully NC not just with them but also with my equally damaged siblings. I had been their black sheep target of abuse for years. 


For about a year or two now I have been having these strange recurring nightmares. It started with insomnia, then these extremely vivid dreams that would be erased from my memory almost immediately.  But after more than a year of them I’ve gotten enough snippets to know that they are dream recreations of various stages of my youth and young adulthood. The dreams themselves are all innocuous like getting groceries or something mundane, but there is always this sense of despair. I know that there are some that are scary or intense somehow because they wake me up when I try to fall asleep but I can’t recall anything of them whatsoever. I realized that I spend half the day dreading having to sleep again.


On top of that I have little split second flashback memories with the same despair emotion all day long. These memories can be of dreams, or real memories, but they always just suck emotionally no matter how bland the memories are.


I’ve been undergoing EMDR therapy so I assume that is stirring stuff up. I really wish I could find a way to get an understanding of these dreams and move on. I want to enjoy my life now instead of being stuck in the past that I hated.

I feel so much better.,"It was about the third time she brought up my 8!!!! year old son’s weight, always because she was trying to “help” since “other” people could be mean. I already had to overcome body dysmorphia myself. That alone had me ready to cut contact. Then in the same conversation she said “I’ve never been critical” and I laughed out loud. She acted offended. I started calling out things she had done including the bs comments about my son’s weight, just like she had done with me. I had previously started compiling a list of various mean comments and things they had done to me. With her it was covert so it took me until now, nearly 40, to see the extent of the damage. I went to the list and just started listing stuff off to her. I kid you not it was like the scene in the movie where the shapeshifter is dying and shifting through all the forms it took. She went to tactic after tactic after tactic just getting more and more desperate when I didn’t take the bait. 

At last I said “Don’t expect a call.” Hung up. Blocked her number. Then I sent a text to my narcissist dad and told him he had never once acted like an actual loving father and that I was blocking him too.

That was it. I felt free, like I could breathe, but I also felt guilt, particularly toward her, because that had always been her favorite hook to use. I would wonder if she was upset, but I would also think that she is probably absolutely giddy inside from the drama she can milk out of it with her friends. Then I’d think of the damage she would do to my son given the chance and I would get angry and more determined. Even if I felt some guilt I had no choice when it came to defending him.

My wife was very supportive right from the get go. She never liked them and hated how they acted to me and although she saw the abuse she knew I was too stubborn if pushed and she patiently waited for me to see it. God bless her for that! I have a friend from when I was young who saw the abuse first hand and was supportive. My in-laws have been kind and loving and make sure I know I am part of their family. I also have a great therapist, mental health nurse practitioner (I just call her a psychiatrist because she is actually better).

I’m fortunate to have all that. I wish everyone did. They and the list helped me in moments of doubt, and I’ve continued to add to it.

It has been several weeks or a month since I went no contact. The first few days I felt like I could breathe for the first time ever. I did struggle with guilt as I mentioned. I also struggled with sadness and grief. I had finally let go of expecting them to ever change. I had to grieve for that loss of hope.

Now however, I am starting to feel much better. My wife sees it too and tells me I look healthier, stand straighter, express my needs constructively, and just generally have more confidence and more willingness to be myself. My compulsive spending even went down.

I literally look up more. Walking out of the local store I’d be looking at the car or the ground. Now I walk out and I see the mountains and misty clouds and sky.

It was a drastic step but it was the right one. Society constantly tells us that we can’t do that. That we have to put up with it. We don’t. I hope those of you who read this and need to take that step will find the strength and support to pull through it. For those who have done it and still struggle I hope you find relief.

I wrote this post in hopes that it could bring hope to those of you facing this decision. I’m not saying it is always the right call, but if you need to make it you should not beat yourself up.

All through childhood. They would yell and scream, my mom would come tell me all about how mean my dad would have been to me. Then she would lean on me for emotional support.

On the other hand if I expressed anger or sadness it was always immediately dismissed as unimportant.

I'm in a situation where I have no license or car and a bike with no storage my narc doesn't have access to, which means he can and will pop the tires as often as he can, which means I'll either have to keep getting them fixed or continue relying on him for rides unless I can finance a car (which he historically has also sabotaged), which obviously takes funds away from moving out and extends my time here...and so on.

That alone makes it daunting enough to find a ""cover job"", because he'll make it as difficult as possible to even maintain it, but he'll also be able to predict how much money I'll be getting and be especially invasive of/manipulative with my finances and purchases, even if I keep them personal, as I have a right to do.

I barely even trust him not to mess with my things while I'm out of the house, so naturally I'm hoping to move out as quickly as possible. But knowing I have very little way of transporting things, other than a UHaul truck (important note to remember as I'm writing this), and that he plays games with money and likes to stalk me, how do I even begin looking for a place that he won't know about?

I've had roommate offers from a few contacts before, and I trust them.

For the choices I had to make to survive the choices they made, and knowing how he'll make up all these wonderful things from my childhood (his version of it, anyway) while putting down the actual living version of me just because I wouldn't fall in line (and sacrifice the person I made myself into without him in order to work with and appease him, even though I don't and shouldn't have to do that).

He's already getting to a point where he's idealizing and memorializing a childhood version of me that never existed and a version of my childhood that never existed. Showing appreciation for things that never happened or that he barely even noticed at the time, if at all. But now that it's convenient to make these stories up and pretend he had a different version of me to treasure than the one standing up for myself and setting boundaries he doesn't appreciate, he's started doing it more and more, and it's hilarious how different our stories of that version of me are.

And there's no way I can really say different.

They've been cleaning the area where I temporarily was forced to store them and I, in my attempt to assume I didn't have to specifically list an entire itemized inventory for them to know not to touch my things, assumed it wouldn't be included. In the past, this person has had a habit of taking other people's things to the garbage dump, including video tapes and useful electronics that were not their property, and only recently started ""taking things to the thrift store"", but I can only confirm that's their destination if I'm involved, and I recently have not been able to be.

They claim they ""didn't know"" the books were mine. As the majority of what they've been clearing out was their partner's property, and for various unfortunate reasons, a lot of mine is mixed in, *and* because I haven't been able to help in the way I traditionally have and needed to be (specifically for things like this), they had an easy excuse: ""There are lots of books around here that were just going unread, so I thought...!""

...1) there are not that many books. All of the books that there are were either hers or mine, and it was obvious which ones are mine. 2) This person *knows* I value books and do actively read them, but they personally are against such intellectualism and have been trying to offload things from their life as a means of self-preservation and power tripping, so of *course* you either need to be achingly overly specific (and have them do a genie routine and find loopholes in every single thing you say), exhaustingly involved (and open yourself up to their constant self-obsessions), or accept that your property is never, ever safe and they'll always have an excuse for it.

So, box of books is gone. The claim is they're at the thrift store, which I don't specifically believe due to past behavior and social track record of the involved individual. Upon questioning, they claim they're maybe willing to go there with me and see about ""getting them back""; I am unable currently to fix problems like this on my own, making it more infuriating that it might have happened at all. (They like to play games with my neurodivergences and attachments specifically to get meltdown-style rises out of me, and set my progress in life back constantly. This is not the first time something like this has happened, and it almost always follows a period of time in which they're *especially* narcissistically manipulative to drive me to the point of total isolation and grey rocking, so they can claim that I bothered them and follow it up with other events similar to this that are seemingly specifically designed to infuriate me for being uncontrollable and setting boundaries with them. Fun!)

However, again, I don't believe they took them anywhere but the garbage dump, but I am concerned that the whole thing is a game to humiliate me, waste my time, and get rid of my books that I need while laughing to themselves in their power trip. (It was known that they were my books; however, they weren't *specifically* marked and this person is very good at getting away with doing very terrible things with social manipulation, ""I don't remember""s, and ""I assumed"" this and thats. So, inherently frustrating as a person to deal with.)

So, I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to waste a Saturday and give them attention they don't deserve, knowing they very likely are not at the thrift store. I'd like to let the books go, knowing I might never see them again excepting if I try and remember what they were and hope to repurchase them. But some of them were valuable research copies I had filled with notes and study work, and all of them were necessary for my work; without them, I can't really get any of my writing or research done, so I'm almost completely out of ways to continue making money doing what I'm good at. (This is known to this person too, because I keep going on about how important these things are and how much I need this work, revealing *exactly* the things they can use to toy with me. 🙃)

It's infuriating that they would do something like this; not surprising. But the latest in a long line of similar behavior patterns against me. I can maybe spend this weekend with them trying to fix it. But there doesn't seem to be an easy win here. I was planning on spending this weekend working since this is my first one actually free in quite sometime, and I'm fairly sure this person *knew* that so of course they'd set me back like this.

But. Advice is definitely desired. What can I do? Is there anything I should be doing here? I've been high tension for days because of the sudden loss and change of plans and environment situations. Obviously it's not very pleasant.

Sorry if this isn't the right subreddit to post this on. I was going to post it to some of the autistic ones, but as the person involved is one of my n-family members, it definitely feels more appropriate for this one.

15,1189,raisedbynarcissists,2023-05-18 15:55:44,The_Teacat,Bit of a vent...grey rocking is the hardest thing I know I have to do. There always seems to be so few real ways to adjust when no contact is no option.,"(ETA: Flaired as rant/vent because, although I feel like support might help, I'm not sure what would be most helpful. As you'll see, I do know most of what I *should* be able to do realistically-speaking, so I'm not sure about the advice thing, but I'm not opposed to advice at all. I also know that just talking about what has happened and knowing people have heard it helps validate the experiences, but that's no one's job except maybe a therapist...and the therapist racket in my area is, uhm, very much less than stellar and that can and has been used against me in the past, so...? Ahhhhhh? TFW your experiences lead you to overexplain and overthink everything.)

When they know every detail about you, when they're expert manipulators, when their plan for you goes back years and you're just beginning to realize how stupid you were, when you can barely move without them knowing. When you have to shut down and sacrifice when you've already lost everything, and when they use even that against you.

Grey rocking is the hardest thing you can do. Watching it all fall apart...hoping the next thing you do might help you get out. Knowing what it's going to cost you to help you escape. Realizing keeping yourself safe and hidden just isn't enough, all while exhaustingly keeping yourself shut down and as apathetic as possible to give them as little as possible. While everyone you cared about fades away because they can't help you and you can't even talk about what's happening, let alone save yourself. (They made sure of that years before I realized what they were even doing. I was innocent and stupid then, and it took me too long to catch on, longer still to figure out where their plans were going, and longer after that to figure possible ways out. In a game I never wanted to play in the first place.)

I read the guide on narcissistic traits (as if I don't know from experience already...) and good lord, it's terrifying how many specific memories seem directly referenced by the article. Although for me, it's a male parent...something that makes it even more especially humiliating to talk about, since - as in the article - he's very competitive and likes to screw with my grooming and self-worth habits, and what grown male adult wants to admit their own male parent is doing things like that to them? (My mother, while she was alive, was their other toy like this and she never even really realized it. I tried to help, but they separated us and she ended up not believing me at all. Probably should've ensured better security for myself and for her before I did that. But that was in the earliest stages of waking up to what they're doing, and when they began to realize I was realizing now too.)

I used to see a bright future, and I knew I was almost there. I can still see it somedays. I've always had parts of me *know* these things were happening even as I watched every opportunity I gave myself be stolen away and ripped apart, but I've always struggled with being slow and naive and it's taken me far too long to put the pieces together. Usually I don't realize what the goal was of a particular step in the plan was until hours or days afterward; and it's deeply unsettling to know there *is* one and more exhausting to have to spend hours figuring out what it is just so you can suggest ways to yourself to counteract and escape it. Or at the very least, hopefully survive emotionally long enough to see another day.

There was even a time they teamed up and were so much and so intimidating that I was completely convinced and *terrified* that they were going to kill me. I still think they might. And maybe that’s part of it. But I had no way to show an intention so I couldn't call for authority's help like my friends kept suggesting I do, and obviously I couldn't reach out to my friends for backup, as that's unfair, harmful, and not something anyone should really have to do.

But regardless, I lost what was left of my friend group that weekend. Leaving me with only everyone online I was smart enough not to talk to about it, and very little support overall. (Largely because I'm just not situationally-stable and secure enough to be able to continue maintaining friendships in a safe way, so I can't commit to anything, I can't provide anything, I can't make a single plan without knowing he'll ruin it as soon as he learns - or already have found a way to schedule my future just a few days ahead. One of the first and most regularly recurring ways I ended up losing *most* of the things I was once so on top of. - , so everything falls by the wayside.)

So much of the things on this list have happened to me...he even ruined me financially in a deeply insidious way, and in some other ways I've been trying to investigate just so I can figure out exactly what and how he did it, and that was one of the earliest ways I really caught on to what he was doing with me. He only recently decided to undo some of that (without telling me anything, of course, although by now it's too late, and I have very few ways of carrying on *without* relying on his involvement and continued knowledge of those things). He's still manipulating my financials and it's all I can do to figure out ways around it. I am 30 years old and terrified to even try and get another job for fear of what he might do with the money coming in, or how my personal documents might disappear behind my back again, or so on and so on...

Anyway. I don't wanna say I don't know what to do...I know what I *need* to do (maintain work, keep financials decent, figure out a potential safe roommate situation, learn to let things to and unfortunately have to sacrifice to be safe). And it's all the hardest things I can imagine. I know I'm holding myself back in some ways; certainly the apathy, long-term emotional shutdowns for safety's sake, and lingering attachments to things I thought would be safe and treasured but can only be used against me (and have, very recently and constantly) are huge detriments. But I can barely even leave my room without keeping a thousand different things in mind to keep myself ready to defend against his games and the overall plan.

I'm hoping I'll be able to be out soon. But it keeps getting worse. So we'll see. Hoping to hear back about jobs, and worried about what happens after that. (As more of my art supplies vanish, and recently, a box of books I needed and was actively using for research and my once-hopeful professional career...they always go after your passions. And always the ones that could help you/uplift you the most. I want to scream.)

None of it is where I wanted to be right now. I guess that's inevitable...thanks all for listening even a little bit. Talking and writing about it somewhere helps to some degree. I only wish I could use this time and energy to get back to my career and my passions.

18,2004,raisedbynarcissists,2020-04-07 16:20:12,introvertedfreak21,I think having seizures has made my dad a narcissist.,"So, here is the context to the story. I'm a 22 female.

I live with my dad and step mom since I was 11. Well, my dad never had any mental problems as I grew up but I do believe he took advantage of my need for approval because he would just teach me to do as I am told instead of think for myself. As I've gotten older, I have started to see more and more of how badly that affected my image of myself. I would get unbelievably depressed if I thought I hurt someone. I truly believed that if I am not helping someone, I'm worthless. That if I don't always help my friends when they are in need, I am a bad friend. It was so grounded in my head that I need to help others that I never stopped to help myself.

Now that I am 22 years old, I've started to gain more confidence. My father was diagnosed with generalized eplisey about a year ago but doctors believe it could be form a blockage in his heart making it hard to get air to his brain properly. He was gonna get catheter in his heart before COVID-19 really took a hit and his surgery was canceled. But before that, I left my warehouse job so that I could help him go back to working as a independent contractor. I wasn't gonna make.much at all since I couldn't lift anything due to scoliosis but I thought that it wouldn't be so hard since I was helping my dad and I thought he would respect what I say since we were using my truck. However, every time his boss yelled at him for something that wasn't his mistake(store damaged product but claim it isn't damaged), he would want to drink. First few times I just endured it because I wanted to help my dad. Soon enough it was becoming so often that I had enough of it, it was so bad he left my unlocked, running vechile to buy alcohol while I was in a gas station to use the bathroom and buy a drink. I eventually made a sign that state there would be no alcohol allowed in my vehicle because I just couldn't stand his drinking anymore, it was to a point I would drop his drunk butt at a bar to be picked up by my step mom while I go to my boyfriend's house bawling like a baby because it was just too much emotional stress. I was having to help him when he had seizures(he would normally have only two on stressful days but there have been times up to four and this was going form once a month to sometimes once a week) so his drinking on top of it was really getting to my own mental state and I was depressed being around him.

So, recently his boss has pretty much laid him off without actually firing him(just not giving him jobs to do but still having him employed) because my father seemed to have a stroke one night but refused to let my step mom and I take him to the hospital. Over two days, he was having really high blood pressure, to the point he felt sick all the time so I took him to the hospital. Problem was that the office lady my step mom called for him that morning to say he wasn't well was out for most of the day and I didn't know she only contacted that one person. By the time I was taking my dad to the hospital, his boss and other office women were calling and texting me and him to figure out why he hasn't been working all day. His boss took this very personally even though it wasn't a personal thing.

Now that we are all locked in our homes, I have been trying to stand for myself. I don't just do whatever I am told, I make clear rules for my vechile(which is in my name, had been for two years). Well, a few days ago he was drunk and high, wanting to go to his friends house right aftet I got back from a shopping trip for groceries. I was pretty pissed because he was taking forever to get himself together to go only to cancel it because my step mom was upset he didn't bother to wake her up and ask her about her feelings on him leaving. So the next morning, when he was talking about wanting to do shopping the next morning, I said ""I do not mind helping, I just don't want anyone under the influence while in my vechile."" Before I could even explain more of it, he turned it into me saying he is day drinking. I did not say that, I just said a rule I want to enforce for my vechile. It turned into more of a fight because he decided to say I have no right to make choices in this house because ""he"" pays bills(my step mom is the only one working right now). I even told him that he was the one to tell me I need to stand up to him to gain respect but he just kept acting out at me. I get what I said could offend him but he also said he doesn't respect me because I don't respect myself which only pissed me off more because I would respect myself more if I was raised to think for myself and not just do as I am told.

Now, its been two days since this happened and he's still mad over it. Its to a point that now he's having to ask anyone else he can to take him out to get a few things for the house. All his friends want money to do it so he's now asking his parents. My step mom won't take him because she needs to work form home and he seems to have too much pride to just admit that my help is needed in this house and ask me to take him. I have never said I will not help, I've just made it clear there are rules in my vechile.

I do also want to point out that I'm not the only child here. I have a younger stepsister who pretty much gets allowed to do whatever she wants. They argue pretty often, to the point she is screaming at him yet he never tries to say anything to hurt her feelings but he will go straight to whatever shuts me up when I fight with him. He's only grown more selfish over time and I'm trying myself to figure out what would be best for my mental state because I can't handle being this depressed. I'm at a point where if it wasn't for my boyfriend, I don't think I'd be able to live anymore. I don't wanna get out my bed these days, I cry a lot, and I'm staying up as late as I can just so when I go to bed, I'll just pass out and not have to think. Its gotten so bad its affected my dreams, I'm seeing my dad being drunk and violent even though he's never actually hit me, it seems pretty clear he wants to because he can't control me anymore.

I'm just wondering if these are things other people experience with their parents after something tragic happens.

The thing she didn't realize is that he just went along with the shit she said and she hadn't ""changed"" him (one of the strangest things she ever said was ""never EVER try to stop changing a person""... WTF?) She loved him, and she actually thought she'd gotten him to change, but the one thing she knew was that she could not make him love her back. He stayed with her, and enabled her, because he was too useless to do anything else.

The truth is, I did love my mom. My dad, not so much. But the issue with my mom was that the love was *unhealthy*. Still, I needed love from a parent, so I went after her. I wasn't exactly the GC (that was my older half sister, she didn't have a dad so my mom thought she had to love her twice as much?) but when I found myself being held with all the responsibility but none of the respect, I couldn't take it anymore. After a particularly bad incident when I was 24 I had to go VLC/NC for almost a year to save my own sanity.

In addition to his drinking, my dad is probably in the beginning of dementia at this point. Even if he's not, I know it's only gonna get worse from here with him. He's made it clear he doesn't want a relationship with me and I'm fine with that. I'm starting a family of my own now, my girlfriend has a 14 year old who I've known since she was born. Her father wasn't on the birth certificate and has since died, and if we have a kid together I don't know if he'll get to be the grandpa. But I certainly won't mistake the same mistake he did and treat the older kid who never had a father like she wasn't mine.

Right now I just have to pay off the few loans that ARE on my credit report, as well as my minimal credit card debt. So I'll be watching my score go up over the next few months. Maybe get another credit card so I can have another line of credit. Anyone have any tips on how to do this? Anything would be appreciated.

Thanks for reading, guys. I know my experience isn't gonna be everyone's, but I hope it resonates with some of you. I just needed to get this off my chest, because there's no one I can talk about this with and it's obviously weighing heavily on my mind.",1,3,3,1.0,0,,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/13t3vz2/six_years_ago_it_was_also_a_saturday_morning_and/,False,False

My memory is hazy, so some parts might be inconsistent and there might be missing pieces of information so please bear with me.
  

  
I grew up in a chaotic household. Not a day went by when my father and my brothers would fight. It gets extreme to the point where the police had to get involved. I was a child then, and I knew my brothers resented my father, but I did not know the real reason why.
  

  
Not until I turned twelve. I discovered my father messaging someone online if there were any available men he can fuck. It was a haze after that, I couldn’t focus in school and I would randomly burst into tears during class. Since my class teacher knew my aunt is a fellow teacher in school, she brought me to her. Needless to say, I told her everything and how it affected me. I harmed myself as a way to cope, and I had frequent suicidal thoughts.
  

  
She told my father about it because my depression became worse each day. One day, my parents brought me to this secluded restaurant. My father talked to me privately, and I really expected him to come clean and tell me the truth- but of course he chose to lie. You know what excuse he gave me? “It was my friend using my account. It wasn’t me.”
  

  
I knew he was lying, but I pretended to believe him because I was afraid of him and the consequences that would ensue if I choose to fight for the truth. I didn’t want to cause any more chaos. My depression continued and I still continued to harm myself because of this.
  

  
Weeks later, he found out I was still harming myself.
  

  
Instead of showing guilt and remorse for what he did- and what it did to me, he punished me for my feelings. He beat me up and threatened to ‘lock’ me up in a psychiatric ward since I had ‘lost my mind’. He knew he was the reason why I turned like this, and yet he could do that to me. I was made out to be the villain for being stuck and depressed of the painful truth.
  

  
This happened six years ago, and just recently I came into his office and looked into his laptop with the intent of gathering evidence of him cheating. What I’ll do with the evidence, I’ll just figure it out in the future. Of course, he was still fucking other guys.
  

  
One of the conversations went like this:
  

  
guy: “Let me come over, I’ll just pretend to be a masseur hehe”
  

  
dad: “Next time, it’s too risky right now. I’m dead if I get caught.”
  

  
In relation to this conversation, my brother caught my father doing a blowjob signal to two guys who came into our home.
  

  
In another conversation my father said. “Don’t come early, my kids are still awake.”
  

  
I just don’t get it. How can someone be so fucking shameless? How does he get to be successful and act innocent while my brothers are suffering from the truth? All these lies, all these manipulations, pretending that we are an ordinary family- I’m fucking tired of it all. There are still a lot of shit I couldn’t cover- my energy is drained writing all of this, and remembering it is painful.",2,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/13t36as/my_family_is_a_lie/,False,False

From my pharmacist, I was told that my bc would be unaffected, but that I should take my Lamictal a few hours after my bc, because the estrogen would cause me to metabolize the Lamictal more quickly and I wouldn’t get the full effects.

Currently I have arthritis in my hands, scoliosis in the shape of a backwards S so my right hand goes numb if I stress it and I have one hip slightly higher than the other so it makes one leg seem longer than the other. I do have bad allergies that cause frequent headaches behind my eyes. I take generic benadryl, generic zoloft, and a antacid that starts with an L; I know it's long lasting. I was also diagnosed anxiety but I thought it was more manageable.

So, sometime early 2021, I believe I had my first panic attack. I had been working 12hr shifts five days a week, learning on living on my own with my roommate and boyfriend, and lost my car maybe a month prior. I worked at a warehouse in GA that had no AC; I was given this large order that I hated doing. While I worked on the order, I had this creeping feeling of struggling to breath. I just kept ignoring it but it was getting worse. I ran into my boyfriend at work and it just spilled out of me, I started crying and was struggling to breath. I wasn't in a state to keep operating the machine we used to move around the warehouse. After that time, I started taking Zoloft.

I've been doing better but lately I feel like it's coming back. I had a panic attack at my job today, I currently work in retail and yesterday was super busy and even though I only have a 5 hour shift today, the nonstop growing line caused this feeling of struggling to breath. I called one of the managers over and asked her to take over for me while I take a minute to breath. I went to the family bathroom we have as it was the only private one. I broke down, I was crying and hyperventilating. I didn't feel like anything was mentally, I just couldn't get a grip on my body. I'm just wondering if this sounds like a panic attack. I still have this tight feeling in my throat. I do have Hydroxine to help prevent panic attacks but I don't feel it's strong enough.

He has a quartar sized hole in his heart which causes low blood pressure to a healthy degree. Its not enough to make him easily weak when standing or have any issues like that. However when he got covid back in December 2021, he's been having this issue where he will stretch really hard while standing and right as he does, he just suddenly falls on the floor. He's still awake and responsive but he needs a minute or two before he can stand back up. It was something that only happened maybe once a month but its starting to become more frequent after he had covid. I also got covid form him but all I've experienced since then is a lot of mucus production and congestion, neither which he has to my knowledge. He doesn't drink, smoke, or do any drugs. He doesn't take any prescription meds regularly either. His diet isn't the best, I'm working on getting us both to eat more vegatablss and less red meat. Any advice or suggestions would be helpful, I'm not really sure how to describe what happens to him in a way I can research it since its like fainting but he's still responsive and aware, just his body loses all energy in a brief moment.

One time I tried to pull at some of this skin and found that very painful, like ten times worse than a bad hangnail. My step mom suggested it was bad athlete's foot so I bought some cream form Walgreen's for Athlete's foot. It says it is clotrimazole cream and I am not sure if I should use it daily but I've used it almost weekly. The cracking hasn't gotten better. I forget about it a lot, to be honest. I also take Zoloft for Anxiety, Birth control, and Naproxen 500mg for my back though I'm working to get off of that and may see a spine specialist soon. I was worried that maybe this was actually some other health concern as Athlete's foot is just one of many reasons why my heels are cracking. There is also a lot of peeling skin around my pinky toe(the smallest one), that hasn't been as bad as the cracks though.

I also have scoliosis which was what the Naproxen is meant to help with.

A little background, I work at a warehouse. Due to the pandamic, we are short staffed and I live in a right to work state. They make us do 12hr shifts almost every day and make us come in for a sixth day every third week. At the time, I had worked one 10 and a half shift, and two 12 shifts. It wasn't the first time I did that and in the heat of summer, I'd been working at that job for over a year now. My only idea of what stressed me out was the job in combination of my boyfriend buying a motorcycle and having been in an accident that previous Friday. He's fine, just bad roadrash but it still scared me.

Last Wednesday, I had what I was told was a panic attack. I had felt this tight feeling in my throat, like a ball had formed there. It got worse and worse, making it harder and harder to breathe. It got a point where I felt like I was drowning. I had ran into my boyfriend and that's when it all just overtook me, I started wheezing and was struggling not to cry. I refused 911 because I could talk and I could calm down but not enough to be breathing normally. It was a struggle to talk. My step mom came and got me from work. She gave me two options, I could go with her to the liquor store and she would buy me a few drinks or I could take half a xanax(she had a prescription for these). I took the xanax because I don't really like drinking alcohol much. After I took the medicine, she bought me some food, and in the maybe 20mins form when she got me, got food, and took me to my house, the xanax kicked in and I never felt so relaxed before. I never knew how much tense I really held in my body, no other meds I took helped me relax my muscles so well and it made me question so much of what doctors told me.

I had been told because of my back, one leg would always be tenser and never relax as well as the other leg did. I took meds to relax my muscles so I wouldn't be in pain. Everything else made the pain mild enough that I could ignore it. Xanax wiped that pain out completely, my muscles fully relaxed for the first time in forever. The next day I was off of work and I could feel how much it hurt to have that medicine out of my system. I mainly stayed home that day as it hurt a lot to walk around. I wanted to think maybe my legs were tired because I had worked an 8 and a half hour shift before my panic attack. The next two days after, I was just pretty sore but managed fine. The Sunday morning was different, I had to work that morning. I could feel that tight feeling in my throat again so I thought it wouldn't hurt to take just half a xanax before work. It was the best I was able to work ever. Nothing hurt, I did feel mildly sleepy but it was no worse than my usual tired(I had to wake up at 6:45 that morning), the sleepy feeling went away with time but I could move with no pain. My fingers didn't hurt form folding tons of shirts, my feet didn't ache form standing all day, and I was just able to move fine. I worked 12hrs that day and I didn't start hurting till the last hour of my shift.

With all that in mind, I decided that I needed to search out therapy. I set up with an online therapy service that my insurance mostly covers. Today I woke up with my shoulders aching all day and just feeling weak. I was ready to just get this appointment over with so I could get some answers. The video call was set up, I waited 20mins for the therapist. Watched this little thing say she was unavailable then online then back to offline. I was later told that I missed the appointment somehow and that I had to reschedule. I was mad because I sat in such an anxious state waiting for this. I felt like I'd throw up and was shaking. I set up another appointment and sent an email about what happened to the support team. I decided to just give it a try of half a xanax again and a hot shower. The pain in my shoulders went away, I was able to breath normally, and no longer felt nauseous. I do have another appointment set up next Friday but I just want some advice on if this sounds like something else. I always avoided medicine like Xanax or strong pain killers because my mom was an addict who died of an overdose and my father isn't much better, he would only mix xanax with some alcohol which I know is the number one thing recommended not to do.",2,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/AskDocs/comments/p5roem/physical_anxiety_issue/,False,True

I started to have PVCs a year ago. Had a clear echo, EKG and stress test in December. Since then, I'm learning how to live with the health anxiety PVCs have caused me. Recently though, I began to feel PVCs during exercise. It's important to say that I haven't exercised in at least 8 months because of health anxiety. Also due to COVID-19, I spent these past months at home and did not move around a lot. 

I have a good diet and normal blood work. I noticed my PVCs don't have anything to do with the intensity of exercise. I can run 15 minutes on a 160bpm and I don't feel anything, but if I walk 30 minutes on a lower heart rate I might get one or two PVCs. I can ride the bike very fast for 30 minutes to 1 hour until I start to get some PVCs. Usually it's when I'm doing the exercise for a long time that they occur. It also doesn't have anything to do with my heart beating faster because I feel nothing when I work out hard. 

I am really worried about it. Other than that I have no symptoms at all that could indicate CAD or heart failure or something like that. I am quite reluctant to get another stress test because last time I had a panic attack on the treadmill and the doctor wasn't so nice. As I said, I haven't exercised due to health anxiety and my heart beating faster still gets me anxious and sets me into a panic attack sometimes. I don't feel ready to have one again so I'm looking for advice or reassurance. What could this be? I wonder if it's because my body has not moved at all in 8 months and I'm just getting back to it so it's slowly getting used to exercise again?",4,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/AskDocs/comments/jilhkr/pvcs_on_extended_exercise/,False,True

I haven‘t had any alcohol in 8 months but used to drink a lot. I started to feel really strong ectopics last year in July. I had a clear stress test, ekg and echo in December. 

The ectopics caused me extreme health anxiety and I completely stopped exercising. I used to ride 14km everyday on the bike. I haven’t really exercised in over a year but I am trying to get back to it now.

I was a very long time without feeling any ectopics but have had some of them for the past weeks. They eventually come and go. A few days ago, I was riding the bike for one hour not very hardly when I started to get a lot of ectopics. I made a 10 minute pause and didn‘t get any of them and then I was back on riding for 15 and got a few more. I was also riding on a very bumpy road so I‘m wondering if that worsened them. I‘ve been trying to exercise everyday for 10 minutes despite my anxiety (exercise really triggers me) and I have never experienced ectopics during these times although my heart will go up to 190bpm. 

I also can‘t tell if they‘re really ectopics because they aren’t nowhere close to the ones I was experiecing last year. It doesn’t feel like ectopic, because I just get this weird feeling in my neck and it doesn’t go away quickly like the normal thud on my chest I used to feel, so I‘m wondering if I‘m just overly aware of the blood going through my neck because I am so anxious?

A week ago I (47M) passed out during bloodwork where a nerve was touched. Had never happened to me before. Lost feeling in my hands during and after the short episode.

My BP and HR have shot up as well. Came on very quickly.

My understanding is time is critical for treatment for first attack if this really is MS. I’ve gone to ER (bloodwork and CT were clear) and been referred to a neurologist but that appointment could take weeks. I’m talking with my general practitioner on Monday where I plan on asking for an MRI asap.

Could you see this kind of reaction just from hitting a nerve during bloodwork? If so, could it take months to resolve? Assuming it may be MS, what should I do in the meantime until I can be seen by a neurologist to try to minimize my chances now of relapses in the future? What else should I be asking my GP?

He can't go outside because he has severe allergies. Both him and his roommate regularly smoke weed indoors for medical purposes. My friend smokes in his room across the house from the kitchen with the door shut, windows open and makes reasonable efforts to keep the smell from traveling to the rest of the house, which roommate has said works well. The roommate is currently sleeping in the living room for unrelated reasons. He only smokes stiizy pods though the living room connects directly with the kitchen. The kitchen does have a door on it that always remains shut. 

Recently the cat was seen acting very lethargic and later was unable to walk properly. The roommate took the cat to the vet but when he returned he told my friend that the vet had asked him directly if anyone in the house smoked marijuana and then said that the reason for the cat's behavior was that it was being exposed so regularly to weed that it was constantly high and it was causing neurological damage. The cat is receiving treatment and is recovering well and my roommate no longer smokes in the house but my question is more about how a vet would come to this conclusion. Is it possible that it's so obvious weed was causing the issue that the vet felt confident to ask for it specifically? The roommate also said that the vet specified that a stiizy wouldn't be able to cause the damage in the way a bong or dab rig could which would make sense except that the roommate has confirmed themself that the efforts my friend had been putting into masking the smell had been effective and also my friend is across the house and the smoke would have to travel and get through a couple of doors. And yes, while a stiizy isn't nearly as strong, repeated use throughout the entire day still leaves the house smelling just as if you've been smoking from a dab all day and it wouldn't be hard to make it into the kitchen if people are regularly opening the door to go in and out. 

My friend and I are just really confused as to the circumstances of the diagnosis, especially since he's basically receiving all the blame.

About 2 years ago, around May or early June, she had her first two 2 relatively mild seizure events (no loss of consciousness or ""paddling""--just unable to stand, shaking violently, smacking her lips, and looking terrified) about a week apart. Her vet checked her blood, and said that everything looked normal. There were no more incidents until...
The following spring, last year, she went to the vet 2 separate times within a few weeks for her boosters and rabies shots. Within between a few days to about 3 weeks after both visits, she had multiple instances of the same kind of events of varying length and severity (again, no loss of consciousness, etc., although one time she lost control of her bowels, which would NEVER happen otherwise).
I talked to the vet about it, and she asked me to keep a log. I also asked her about CBD, and, although she couldn't ""officially"" recommend it, she did say that some of her patients had had good results with it. So I started her on CBD oil--.5 ml. of 1200 mg. oil 2x per day.
A week after we started the CBD oil (I believe it takes a little time to start working), she had another 9-minute long episode (I got video of that one). It was awful, but, as usual when it ended she was back to normal and just wanted to go outside. That was 23 days after her last booster last year. It was on April 30th, and she had no more until...
Exactly one week after THIS year's boosters, which were given on 30 March, she had another episode. She was shaking so hard I was terrified she'd die. After about 5 very long minutes, she was fine again.
(I should also mention that she had an apparently benign mast cell tumor removed from near one of her nipples a few months ago, in winter, and she's recovered well, except that she is now terrified of the vet's office...understandably, as the procedure was no doubt really frightening for her. But there were no subsequent seizures then.)
Sorry for the long background story!
Of course I started to associate the seizure events as being related to the vaccinations, but I've seen very little reliable info online making that correlation, and the vet says it's not likely. But why do they always happen only in the spring, and within a few weeks of boosters?
The other thing I learned from ""Dr. Google, Veterinary Edition"" is that boosters for distemper/parvo/bordatella, etc., only usually need to be given every THREE years--NOT every year, as we've been doing per the vet office's suggestions. I've also read that multiple vaccinations boosters given at one time might be too much.
So...long story short... could this all somehow be coincidence? I'm wondering if (a) she's predisposed to seizures, and either the stress of the vet visits and/or the boosters themselves can trigger them, or if they can be seasonal. (I don't use fertilizers or pesticides in the yard, she doesn't go to dog parks, and we take our walks on city streets, away from other dogs. I have no plans to ever board her anywhere.)
One more thing--she's EXTREMELY heat-intolerant, which I assume is due to the Boxer in her.

3,2953,AskVet,2023-02-12 17:47:02,MoonyGraham37,My cat ate the smallest amount of garlic - should I get the vet involved?,"Details: my cat is 4 years old, spayed, domestic shorthair, she’s  probably 10+ pounds, and she’s extremely antisocial so taking her to the vet is a lot of stress for her. I also can’t really afford a vet trip just to hear them say she’s fine and I’m over-reacting. We also live in Connecticut, USA.

What happened:
I made dinner last night which calls for 1/16 of a teaspoon of garlic powder mixed with butter to go on top of what I made, which drips onto the plate. After I was finished I heard her lapping the plate because of the butter - I want to say 3 little licks - and then she looked up and started licking her chops so I imagine she definitely tasted the garlic. We looked at each other and I just kinda said “that’s…probably not good for you” and shoo’d her away from the plate. And then I looked it up online and apparently garlic is one of the worst things a cat can eat. Everything I’m reading says that 1/16 of a teaspoon per 5 pounds is fatal, but she’s 10 pounds and she only had a small fraction of 1/16 - just enough to taste it. Like. Literally maybe 3-5 actual specks of garlic powder.

Now:
I didn’t hear or see any vomiting and she’s acting fine this morning, but I know that it may take a couple days to a week for things to go wrong. Am I overthinking this or do you think she’ll be okay? I just need a second opinion besides my own.

TLDR; Do I need a new vet? Should I get a second opinion? Is it normal for a vet to be so dismissive with these things? He recently took over the animal hospital and the previous owners were very different and they were the only vet I've ever used. I don't want to be spending all this time and money on special food that won't help him lose weight either if allergies are most likely not the issue. I guess I just feel like I'm failing him trying to be his doctor via Google, but also don't want to spend time and money finding a new vet to just be given the same vague non-advice. He's also been going to this place since he was a kitten.

Okay, the skin issue: My cat has had dandruff, scaly flaking skin, hair coming out, scabs and wounds, etc, for the past 6 months. Took him in for his wellness check and shots March 3rd. I wanted to get him on a diet and discuss the skin stuff, but I think the vet was in a hurry to leave. I even showed up a half hour early when they asked. He barely touched my cat, ran his hand up his back and said he's not able to groom because of his weight, to brush him more and feed him less. Really no guidance on either issue. 

I've used sprays and waterless baths, various brushes and combs, and nothing helps. Called them back a month later to schedule another appt and instead the receptionist said they'll give me Revolution in case there's fleas (which he was given at the beginning of April, no change). She also recommended adding omega 3 supplement oil to his food, which I did for a couple months. She also suggested it could be a food allergy which would require a limited diet. So it took me a bit to research foods, but he's been on a no chicken, fish, or turkey diet for two weeks (I stopped the Omega oil because it had fish as well). I know that could take a couple months to show improvement though.

I feel weird doing all this really without any guidance. I am still limiting his portions and measuring all his food, but it's been hard because I have been switching his wet food trying to find the best ones and the kcal in each one is different, so he's lost about a half a lb since March. I continually check for flea evidence as well. I'm afraid that this is really bothering him or that he'll get an infection before he loses enough weight or I figure out if it's a food allergy. Not asking for a diagnosis, just want to know if I'm on the right path or if I should find a new vet to help.

• Age: 8 years

• Sex/Neuter status: Male, neutered

• Breed: DSH

Body weight: 20 lbs

• Clinical signs: redness, missing fur, scabbing, over grooming, overscratching, head shaking, black coffee grounds type dirt inside ear.

• Duration: two weeks

• Your general location: WI, USA

Hi, my car started showing all the signs of ear mites a couple weeks ago. At first I just thought he had accidentally scratched his ear, as only one ear was affected with redness. But last week both ears became affected, so I called the vet. They walked me through a list of symptoms to check for, and that's when I noticed the black dirt in his ears. He already has a wellness check (vaccines and a talk about his weight) scheduled for March 3rd, so the doctor said I could wait until then for treatment of the mites.

But I can tell he's miserable, and I want to make him at least comfortable until he can get in, so I called them back the next day (Thursday) and asked if there was anything else I could do. I'm already on the cancellation list, but she recommended getting some cat ear cleaner and using a cotton ball to try and clean them out.

So yesterday I went to the pet supply store and grabbed some car ear wipes, and I noticed they had ear mites drops for cats as well. I grabbed those too, would it be okay for me to try those? Idk if they would kill all the mites, but at least it might provide some relief for the next couple weeks? It's called Four Paws Aloe Ear Mite Treatment for Cats. It has pyrethrins (.05%) and piperonyl butoxide (.5%).

I just don't want to screw up any treatment the vet may have for him, or give him something that's dangerous. I know he's not officially diagnosed with mites, but the doctor and I both think that's the issue.

The vet said that it’s possible the heart murmur will disappear on its own, but getting an echocardiogram is probably wise regardless of whether the murmur persists or not. The breeder said the vet called it a ventricular septum defect.

What should I do? The breeder offered to pay some of the costs for an echo and is also willing to make an agreement for a money-back guarantee of sorts. We’ve been waiting for these kittens since February, when the mom was pregnant.

We were very excited, but now a bit unsure. How serious is this or could this be? Should we continue or cancel?",2,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/AskVet/comments/13t11jk/kittens_heart_sound/,False,False

I know this is intended to promote fairness but it only makes everything worse. While my daughter was young and I was eager to secure stable employment I worked in an agency as a temporary employee. I very much wanted permanent status, and so I drove to interviews as far as 7 hours away. I got told 5 separate times that they would have hired me….. if they hadn’t planned on someone else. Once I called ahead and asked the manager ahead of time if this was the case. Thankfully she told me the truth and saved me a heavy rush hour drive. That could have been time number six.


In another agency I saw it multiple times when promoting, or rehiring an old hire.  I’ve no doubt most people are familiar with this if not having seen it personally, but there is an unseen cost to the taxpayers in this case, and it is huge. Panels also must have three people on them, usually two managers and a senior. Then it takes them multiple days to interview, and multiple days to decide. That’s three totally wasted salaries for at least 3 days and sometimes far more. So if the manager makes 30 an hour and other two make 15, which I think is generous, and you include the money that employers pay towards workman comp and unemployment, etc… Which can run up to 50% from my memory in staffing but I don’t know exactly now, so we’ll say 25% to be generous. That ends up $60 plus 25%, or $75 per hour!!! Three people, three working days of eight hours each and you have that times 24, or $1800 for an interview where they have no intent on considering anyone else.


That’s just the state cost though. Then there are the employees being rejected needlessly to satisfy their quotas. Those people spend time and money going to interviews, they get their hopes up, and then they get them dashed over and over. That bears a psychological burden and a complete mistrust of the employer.",0,2,2,1.0,0,,/r/antiwork/comments/s382nh/mandatory_number_of_interviews/,False,True

I have an awful bossy coworker and I heard a customer ask if we had any more of a certain product in the back. This awful coworker replies, ""I don't have any more in stock""

I know it's a very simple statement but it reveals a LOT. Any coworker I've had say this kind of comment (vs. Just saying 'we') has been fucking awful. They think they own the store and their coworkers. They are usually suck-ups to bosses and will rat you out for anything. And most importantly, people like this are incredibly difficult to work with. They're always on a power trip.

I have another example. My GM called the cops on a guy panhandling outside the store. When he was describing it to me, he said ""I don't want him doing that outside MY store"". Bro. It's not your store, it belongs to a corporation. You are just as replaceable as I am... if anything, its OUR or THE store....not ""MINE""....and you guessed it, he fucking sucks. 

Hopefully I'm describing this well. Have you worked with someone that uses ""I"" statements like I described? If so, how was that coworker?

Customer: ""when do you get mums back in stock?""

I've hated this place since the first day I started. My issue is....I literally am unable to look for new jobs. Idk what is wrong with me but this place has sucked all of my energy and I can't bring myself to look/apply.

I've tried looking for new jobs. And I just can never do it. So I was thinking....I need to fucking quit my current job with nothing lined up after. If I quit, it'll light a fire under my ass to get a new job and I'll actually follow through

I'm realizing that I'm stagnating my life. And part of that is because of this job. How long am I going to delay the next chapter of my life? I feel like I just need to quit now so I can finally move on!

My main concern is that once I quit, I won't be able to find a better job. What if I don't get motivated to apply after quitting. What am I going tell my next employer about why I quit this current job?

Idk. I know quitting without anything lined up for after is bad but I feel like I need to just finally quit so I can move on with my life.

Has anyone ever been in a similar place? Anything that helped you to apply to jobs while currently working at an awful one? I need encouragement to quit!

The things he said made no sense and he never watches me work. So I started to think, this evil coworker is probably saying things to him. She has gotten 2 other coworkers out of our department already and they weren't even bad, they were good workers.

(Additionally there is a clock in station immediately beside the employee entrance but I’m forced to use the one in the office because “You’re not allowed”)

So, as evidenced by my 99% on time accuracy stat on Homebase; I enter the building at 7:13, and make the trek to the office to clock in.

Multiple Admin attempted to stop me: getting in my way, whistling at me, & demanding I go put my skates on.
I ignore them, headed straight to the clock in station, and Damn, it’s still 7:14. I need manager pin approval in order to clock in. I stand there for less than 30 seconds, and all 3 on duty admins walk into the office.

“Hey you can’t do that, you need to have your skates on”

Okay, I’m clocked in I’ll go put them on now.

“No we mean you need to have them on before you clock in”

There is no leniency on this machine so I won’t have enough time to lace up my boots and then come back to clock. Unless you’d like me to enter the building with my skates on.

“Why are you making this difficult? You clock in once you’re ready to work, which is with your skates on.”

I’m ready to work as soon as the door shuts behind me, and because I’m restricted from being here early, I have no reason to be here early, therefore I will clock in as soon as I enter the building.

“You can’t do that. You need to be here before then to lace up your boots & be ready.”

If you need me here earlier than 7:15 for any reason, I’d like my clock in time adjusted. Like I’ve said already I’m ready to work and provide value to you once I’m in here. Hell, I’m in the parking lot for 10 minutes or more on a typical day and I don’t get in trouble out there.

“We won’t be adjusting clock in times just for you, but you will be getting ‘written up’”

Okay, I understand I’ll be written up for being here on time.

~*Cue the write-up posturing song and dance*~


Needless to say I will now be arriving early & bothering admin to approve my 69 second early clock ins.",4,3,3,0.67,0,,/r/antiwork/comments/13t2863/written_up_verbally_reprimanded_for_clocking_in/,False,False
19,77,antiwork,2023-05-27 07:59:02,Trackswaq_4,Was this interview unprofessional? Or is it just me?,"Hello all, I hope you’re doing well. I had an interview yesterday and I am curious to see what you all have to say about it.

I initially applied for an Information Technology position at a local health clinic locally, within a couple days I had an email stating that I would like to be met with for an interview. I kindly responded to the email with something along the lines of “Absolutely, what available times do you have?” The IT manager says that he has an appointment for Friday (May 19, 2023) and for Thursday (May 25, 2023) I am a father of 3 with an infant that is barely a month old. I had other obligations to attend on the 19th, so I told the manager that I am available anytime on the 25th. The next day, (May 19, 2023), I got an email from the same manager asking if I could meet him at 10 A.M. that same day. Not a super big deal, I just thought it was kind of weird that he would ask me to come in that day when I had already specified that I had other things to attend. He reassures me that Thursday the 25th would be fine still. I show up to the clinic 15 minutes early (just to ensure that I could find where I needed to go) I talk to the front desk receptionist like the IT manager instructed me to and to ask for (let’s call him Bob). I ask for Bob and they call him and according to the receptionist he totally forgot that he even scheduled me for an interview. He tells the receptionist that he will be there as soon as he possibly can (no ETA)  I was recently laid off from my previous IT job and I have 3 children of my own so I really need the money. So I waited in the lobby in hopes that he would be there in a couple minutes  to get this interview underway. 30-35 minutes later he shows up ready for the interview. I follow him to the conference room that they have in their basement, as soon as we sit down in the chairs, he folds his legs and hops on his phone instantly and stays on it for a solid 15 minutes. (The interview was only 20 minutes long) he asks me several questions about my relevant experience in the field (pretty standard questions) but he did not seem to be listening to what I was saying and would interrupt my sentences with another question. About 10 minutes into the interview, we hear a knock on the conference door, another IT coworker of his says that another person is here to interview. (Apparently he had forgotten about this person too) this gentleman came prepared in a nice suit and ready for his interview. Bob tells the coworker that he needs to come back on Monday for the interview. I feel bad for this poor guy, I know I would have been pissed if I were him. He politely says that he will be back Monday. After he finally gets off of his phone, he looks at me and says, “I didn’t really have time to look at your resume, what are your salary expectations”. I’m not a recruiter or a manager by all means, but isn’t the point of a resume to see your candidates on paper before an interview? Anyways, I explain to him that my salary expectations are around 50k / year. (That was what I was making at my previous job) and that I was willing to go a bit lower if the position starts around that range. He tells me that the position starts off at $15 per hour, and that I could try to talk to HR about possibly getting that starting wage higher. But wouldn’t really count on it. 

I don’t see myself working here anytime soon just because of the wages alone. But I also feel like Bob was completely unprofessional about the entire interview process as a whole. What do you guys think? Am I being a Karen? I don’t want anyone else to have to go through this shitty experience like I have. I’m 26 years old and haven’t had a ton of interviews, but this experience was completely different than any other I have had.",4,1,1,0.67,0,,/r/antiwork/comments/13t1gud/was_this_interview_unprofessional_or_is_it_just_me/,False,False

We are absolutely heartbroken, as you can imagine. Feral is the sweetest and most affectionate cat. 

I had worried about it when we brought her into the house in February, but the vet wasn’t worried, probably because she didn’t behave like a street cat at all. She was cuddly and cute and gentle. 

Since she had her kittens she’s been losing weight, but we just put it down to nursing, and she’s had a bad stomach every couple of weeks, which we put down to her being in heat, or at worst, IBD. But it’s FIV. We have to rehome her as soon as we can, either to a rescue centre, or to a household that where she is the only cat, or where she is with other FIV cats. 

She will have to be a house cat, or live in a house with a completely enclosed garden so that she can’t infect other cats.

I feel so lost and devastated. We love her so much, and were making plans for after recovery and rehoming of the kittens. She was going to be our cat. But now that’s not possible.

I fell in love with her the day we brought her in and she looked up at me with big thankful eyes.

I know we’ve given her a happy home these past 6 months, she’s had the best food, veterinary care and love as we nurses her back to health and through her pregnancy and we also took good care of her before then in the garden. We’ve known her for a year.

There’s a good chance that the kittens aren’t FIV positive, but we won’t know until they are 5-6 months old and can be tested. That’s still 3 or 4 months away, but the risk is low. But one of the adopters can’t take the risk because of their existing cat, and the other adopter is making some tough choices tonight.

Feral has been poorly again the past few days and the vet has suggested that she may have Inflammatory Bowel Disease. We're also preparing for the rehoming of her babies, and I'm so worried about what the stress will do to her. We've started separating her from the kittens for mealtimes to give her a break (they are a LOT).

I'd like some advice on the future... we have 2 cats who were settled into a routine foodwise, and eat specific food. Their routine has been spoiled since we brought Feral into the house in February, and we're still not able to spay her (4 weeks depending on her tummy), so she's in the house all the time.

I've never had a cat with additional needs before, and it's hard. A lot of cleaning up and chasing Feral away from food, as well as kitten wrangling ([kittens](https://www.reddit.com/r/kittens/comments/vcnx7e/8_weeks_old_and_just_going_to_be_so_hard_to_rehome/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) are all fine and gorgeous).

We are prepared, to be in it for the long haul - we think she was abandoned by her previous owner (she's still a juvenile and was living in our back garden last summer) because of her digestive issues. We think this because she knew how to use a litter box when we took her in and she is a loving and sweet cat who's behaviour suggests she once had a home.

I just need to know whether a cat with IBD can live with other cats successfully, or whether she needs to be the only cat in the house. I hope it's the former, because honestly, Feral Fawcett is the sweetest cat, still a kitten really, and I want to give her the happy forever home she deserves. But I also want what is best for her, and if that means rehoming, I'll have to deal with that...",1,2,2,0.76,0,,/r/cats/comments/vco2ah/update_on_feral_fawcett/,False,True

Our gorgeous rescue kitty, Feral Fawcett, has been with us for nearly 6 months. She gave birth 7 weeks ago to 3 beautiful kittens and is just a wonderful mother. We're feeding her 4 times per day, the recommended amount of adult cat food each day, enriched with some kitten food, PLUS she's eating the babies' leftovers. She's only nursing for comfort now, and the kittens are 90% weaned onto kitten food, but Feral is ALWAYS hungry, as soon as she''s finished eating, she bugs us for food all the time. She's always trying to sneak into the kitchen and jump on the counters trying to find food.

We can't leave kibble down for grazing as she is very allergic to every kind we've tried (I'm talking poo-mageddon whenever she has biscuits or treats), even wheat-free, gluten-free, pro-biotic enriched. We've got her on Royal Canin Gastrointestinal adult cat food, mixed with Lily's Adult pate (as the kittens have Lily's too). We actually think she had a home before we found her, but that she might have been abandoned because she had constant diarrhoea and made lots of messes in the house. 

She's been treated for Giardia and her tummy is much better, but she's still always hungry. We're worried about overfeeding and making her sick. Should we just feed her whenever she asks?

TIA 

PS - Yes, we have taken her to the vet multiple times for her tummy issues, but we'd like to try and address this particular issue at home before we take her again.",6,3,3,0.72,0,,/r/cats/comments/v4o531/always_hungry/,False,True

My parents have a cat colony around their home, they feed the cats and sometimes new ones show up. They only have one fertile female that has been hard to trap to spay and that cat had some kittens. We thought it was just three, two gray and one black and white. One gray boy was given to a family friend and my parents kept the other two. Well, about a week ago a gray female cat started showing up. She looks exactly like the mom cat and the gray brother my parents have so we think she is the same age as the other kittens. She isn't spayed yet but my parents told us she was a very friendly cat and were able to get her inside so we could take her home.

So, there is the story of how we got Pepper. She has been slowly coming out of her shell, its a big change from an outdoor cat colony. I'm just so happy and proud to see how far she has come. She went from hiding under our bed and only popping her head out to eat food and get a few pets to now, coming out and chilling on her own, being curious in what's beyond the bedroom door(it stays closed for now) and really enjoying our company.

Every little step forward makes me so happy. She is the first pet we have owned outside our parents' homes. I'm thinking of ways to make her happy and healthy. I don't use a gravity feeder because I've seen how it let's a cat over eat and I plan to use things like raw meat as a treat and changing up her food options. Like she has been doing great today so I gave her half a can of wet food as a treat for being so confident today. I would love any advice as well, I just want to give this sweet girl the best life I can for her. I'm gonna give her a month to get use to the house before I take her to the vet to be spayed and vaccinated.

I am not looking forward to when she becomes a full fledged teenager or adult. I think she might be a maniac or try to steal my things or set my house on fire.

Such as sexuality, I can understand because I'm a bisexual woman. However, I don't personally get smaller labels or one made to break a social construct. I get not everyone feels comfortable in their own skin, maybe they like don't feel true to their gender. I know for a fact that I'm not what a ""typical"" girl would be like but at the same time, when was the genders so heavily forced? Maybe its a bad perspective thing. I grew up with mainly girls and guys to play with, I liked running around outside, getting dirty and exploring nature. My female cousins enjoyed it just as much as my male cousins did. There was no real pressure placed on us to act certain ways. I get that's not the same for everyone.

My perspective may seem off to some. I just never saw any real pressure to act a certain way till I was teenager, where my step mom insisted I needed to do my hair and wear make up to get male attention. Most times, the guys I hung out with just enjoyed my humor and like for video games or for the fact that I was content to hear their issues and try to give objective advice.

I would like perspective on those who came to the conclusion they were nonbinary, it was one of the gender types that I was rather confused on. I respect that it is your choice and there is nothing wrong with that, I just want to gain better understanding.

5,2003,offmychest,2021-05-09 13:53:16,introvertedfreak21,Never an easy Mother's day,"I'm just posting a rant really because I don't celebrate the holiday and it can be a reminder of events leading to my mistrust of most women, even though I am a woman too.

My own mother died when I was 17 however Mother's day wasn't easy when she was around either. She was a junkie that couldn't bother getting out of beds most day, relying on her own father and strong ADHD meds to take care of her kids. I'm thankful I don't remember a lot about her because I just feel there aren't many good memories there. Even still, she was my mother and I was never truly mad at her for what happened, she had bad addiction issues and by the time I was around, she was too far gone. A part of myself will always be missing with her gone, there will be parts of myself I don't understand and will always feel unsure about.

However, I can not say the same about my dad's wife. She is more the real reason why I stopped celebrating this holiday. One mother's day, about 4 years ago(I believe this was only 2 years after my mom passed), I wasn't doing so well that mother's day. I was excited, I remembered that my step mom wanted to make a blanket out of all the cards she got and I thought it would be great if she had this giant like three foot tall mother's day card at the center of it. I had set up the display for these cards at my retail job, so I looked through all of them to find the one I thought she would like the most. I hid it in my closet for like a month waiting for Mother's day, my stepsister thought it was a good idea and my dad did too. I thought I got her a gift she would like.

The day rolls around and I have to work that evening but I got the morning to enjoy. We all got up early to help make her breakfast, ate together, everything seemed fine. The moment my dad walks outside to smoke, my step mom looks at me and says ""You should put a shirt on, no one wants to see your saggy boobs."" I was wearing a spaghetti strap tanktop because it was my pjs, even my stepsis was taken aback. We mostly ate in silence when my dad came back and I went off to my room, upset. My dad checked on me, I was so hurt because I was never very secure about my appearance but it was just so out of the blue. Dad convinced me to at least due presents and then I can stay in my room away from her. We get our gifts ready and I'm thinking maybe she will like my gift and we can move on. No, she didn't like it. She seemed upset by it because she only wanted handmade cards form my sister and I. My dad tries to move on to the gifts form him and my sis to keep her form saying something that will make me cry. I was struggling to hold back tears, it was obvious that I just wanted to go cry. They show off their gifts to her and she still isn't happy with them. They got her stuff to decorate the house with because she likes to decorate but it wasn't good enough. She then asks me why I'm about to cry and before I speak, my dad mentions how today is hard on me without my mother. That breaks me, I can't handle hearing just the reminder that she's gone and just start crying. Step mom is screaming about how today is about her, I shouldn't be crying, all that. Dad gets me to my room, screaming at her to shut up. He tells me to just avoid her by staying in my room and that he's sorry she's like this. I start calming down after a little while and texting my boyfriend only for her to come in and ""apologize"" by going on this long winded rant about her bad mother and then says ""At least your mom is gone, I wish mine was."" I couldn't believe it, I just screamed back ""At least you know yours."" My dad comes in and get step mom out, asking me what she said and just utterly appalled by her words. She tries to apologize again but at that point, I just keep telling her to leave and when she doesn't, I just yell for my dad because I don't wanna deal with this, I gotta go to work in a few hours and deal with all the people celebrating this day while I feel like shit.

They all get ready to leave, going to get their nails done as a Mother's day gift to stepmom. Dad comes in my room and tells me to try and not let this get me down at work, that he's sorry for marrying such a cruel woman and that this really made him look at her differently. He talked about divorce but I knew that wasn't gonna happen, that's a promise he whispered to me for many long years.

After that whole ordeal, I have always refused to celebrate the holiday. I'll talk to her on the day of if I see her but I never tell her happy mothers day, I never sign a card for her, none of it. She utterly shredded any chance she had at forming any kind of mother-daughter relationship with me. We have just acted like adults around one another since. I know this whole thing will hit her harder when it comes down to my eventual wedding because I will refuse to dress with her, she won't go to a bacheloette party for me. That I can all do with my stepsis, who has never been anything but family to me since I met her.

If you read this far, thank you. I've had a rough year and this day just drags out so many nasty memories for me so knowing just a few more people out there might understand this pain helps. And for those who don't, be thankful you don't. Appreciate the hell out of the mother who genuinely loved you, the stepmom who took up the role of mother for you when yours didn't. In these days, real caring mothers are a rare diamond, too many women just have kids too young and for the wrong reasons so be grateful to the mother who you know truly loves you unconditionally. I know I'll give my grandmother a call, she's one of the few women I know truly loved her children and grandchildren with all her heart.",0,2,2,1.0,0,,/r/offmychest/comments/n8envo/never_an_easy_mothers_day/,False,True

But there are somethings that I want to say before we further our relationship. Theoretically, you probably know all of this already, but writing some paragraphs online seems more convincing than having a dialogue inside my head with you.

I do not believe in heaven or hell. Let's be honest: the concept of living forever is just as scary as dying. The concept of living in heaven or hell makes even less sense. I know there is a mystery involving our existence. Maybe we will never really die or maybe we will never live as we are today. We cannot just be here, but I do not think none of us will ever find out.

I do not go to church. I do not like it there. It is loud and crowded. People pray so loudly and I really do not understand why. I do not like the groups, I do not like joining people and praying together, it makes me uncomfortable. I feel judged at church. I feel that if they found out that I am gay, no one would like to have me there anymore. I prefer you and I, you know? Like pals, like mates. I can talk to you and there is no judgment. I can thank you for the good things that happen in my life and I can also be angry at you if something goes terribly wrong, it is okay to be mad at you for awhile, isn't it? I am sure you understand that. I hope you understand that.

I am angry at you about my family. I really am. My mom will have it really hard when I come out. I cannot possibly imagine what my dad will do. He might hate me, he might respect it within time, but he will never come around with the fact that his only child, is a lesbian. And his only daughter wants to get some tattoos to cover up all the scars she has on her wrist from the time she was trying to deal with the discovery of her sexuality. His only daughter does not like dresses or cropped t-shirts. His only daughter prefers ties, suits and masculine clothing. It would save me so much suffering, so much sadness, so much effort if they were simply okay with who I am.

I am not angry at you because of my anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder or my autism spectrum disorder. I can deal with that. Or at least, I am trying my best – even if my best means stealing anxiety pills from my mother's cabin. You understand that, don't you? But I am really angry at you about my physical health issues that do not seem to go away even though I am in perfect shape, even though I exercise, even though I keep my diet clean. These are the things that make me angry at you. I am angry at you. I wish I were healthy. I wish I could be who I was last year. But I cannot, because these issues will not go away no matter what I do. No matter what I try. I am just 18.

I know there are many things that hurt me at the moment and maybe I will never understand why they are happening to me. But it helps to believe that you have some purpose for all of this suffering – that you know I can handle it. I do not understand you – and maybe I never will. But I want to believe in you.

He is emotionally closed off, almost never talks about himself, any information is few and far between, and half of it from coworkers. He is an ex-addict, and that would always worry me. He won't hang out outside of work because he's so introverted. More like impossible. He hates compliments.

I know I'm not special. His attentions shouldn't mean anything and it should be easy to drop this crush because honestly he can be kind of cringey.

BUT

He's so impossibly handsome to me. He smells amazing. He gives the. Best. Hugs. When I am stressed he really listens and gives great advice.

18,91,offmychest,2023-05-27 10:23:41,SadFail976,I wish either I were dead or my father were,"My (19F) father (44M) was never really around growing up and I resent him for that. Even during the times he was around, it was like he wasn’t really there. And if he was there, it would either be to physically punish me for some kind of wrongdoing or handing off his responsibilities for taking care of me to my mom. It’s as if he doesn’t want to deal with me, and nothing I do is enough to convince him otherwise. 

I never really had great memories of my father, and the good memories that I have can all be counted on a single hand. These were the only three times he actually acknowledged me for anything I did or said something as a compliment. I also resent him for being the most petty, insensitive, indifferent, insufferable, negative, emotionally unavailable person I know and the fact that I need to associate myself with him and see him now at any given part of the day makes me want to end my own life. 

My reasoning for this goes from something as simple as taking all of the sweet parts of fruits for himself, to telling me to go jump off a train platform when I’m clearly in distress and not in a good mental space, to insulting me and my appearance and invalidating my pain and suffering, to becoming physical for being too much for him to handle. I have had my panic attacks triggered by him and sent to the hospital because he would try to slap/choke me when we had an argument. Two weeks ago, we had another argument. 

I was diagnosed with a treatable type of cancer earlier year and had a few surgeries done since then and just need to go through radiation to complete my treatment. So no threat of my life being lost, but cancer is cancer and just because it’s treatable doesn’t mean I won’t be feeling like shit from the process and recovery. Two weeks ago, I was 12 days post-op  and needed to go outside to run errands but the ends of my steri-strip from the surgery were staring to curl and get caught on clothing. Before I got dressed I decided it would be a good idea to have the ends be cut off, except the incision site is somewhere that is difficult to accurately maneuver around. And I don’t want to accidentally stab myself with a pair of scissors. 

So I go to my father who is the only person who is home and available to help me, but he ends up ripping off the steri-strip instead, leaving my incision site angry and irritated for a few days. (After a previous surgery, my steri-strip was ripped off in the in my sleep and it woke me up because it was so painful so imagine how this felt) 

I told him multiple times prior to me giving him my pair of scissors to only cut off the edges only and leave the middle of the steri-strip alone, but he doesn’t heed my wishes. Much like how he doesn’t respect anything else about me either. 

I honestly don’t know why I thought it was a good idea to go to him for help in the first place. 

After I realized the steri-strip was gone and the fact that it wasn’t the scissors that were tugging on my skin but him tugging it off, I was speechless and asked him “why he would do that instead of doing what what asked”. And he replied with something along the lines of “stop making it a big deal, i did you a favor” and I stormed to my room to cry and punch the wall because I felt so violated. 

I called my mom to talk to her about what happened to calm myself down and she said she would speak with him. I hang up to go get myself ready to leave, but as I was leaving the bathroom I hear my father talking loudly on the phone with my mom complaining about me along the lines of being an ungrateful brat and other shit talk. I heard this and feel the need to defend myself, but it escalated from there and ended up with him slapping me to silence me.

We haven’t spoken since but today after a few days of radiation, he asks me if I know I need to take my laundry outside to be washed at a laundromat because he doesn’t want the household washing machine to be contaminated. I asked why and he replied saying because me and my clothes are dirty. (I have a separate laundry basket and do my laundry separately from the household but I wasn’t aware I needed to use a whole different washing machine) I honestly don’t understand whether this is coming from a place of ignorance or malice.

My father hasn’t been very supportive throughout my cancer treatment, never asked about my progress, never went with me to my appointments, never checked on me after my surgeries, etc. even said I was a liar when I got my initial diagnosis. And expects me to perform daily normal tasks that are usually easy when I am not feeling awful, when I’m feeling awful.

5,1991,rant,2021-08-30 03:21:54,introvertedfreak21,The though of seeing my dad makes me have a panic attack,"I'm not really sure if this is really my dad being a narcissist or just he's not right in the head anymore.

About a year ago, my dad just suddenly started having seizures, we found out it was because of a blockage in his heart. But he had so many that I feel like its done too much damage. I try to understand that but its just one those things I can't get over.

My sister and step mom notice it too. For me, any time he wants to try to get his way with me(I.e. if he insists on calling me while I'm at work and I just can't call) he will use a guilt trip. Its normally something about ""You are my only kid."" He has raised two daughters, I'm just the only one by blood. ""You are the last of my bloodline."" He actually has a son by another woman, just they don't talk. ""It will always be just you and me."" That one always pisses me off. That's not a life I want, I have a partner who has been with me through thick and thin for the last five years, he will never not be in my life.

Other examples are stuff like when talking to him, its like he's not listening. He'll repeat his point again at you, like you didn't hear him the first time. One time we were eating at a restaurant and he just suddenly started talking about something we talked about hours ago.

He's also just irresponsible now, he keeps mixing Xanax with alcohol. I know, it's literally the one thing any one would tell you not to do. They aren't even his, they are for my stepmom who has an anxiety disorder. He also likes to help out his friends all the time without talking to his wife. He also talks about divorcing her all the time but I don't think he should. Any woman willing to put with all that form him really does love him.

I needed to vent about these things because ever since I moved out in December of 2020, He's gotten worse about bothering me. He just can't seem to understand that I live my own life now, I can't just drop by whenever he wants me too nor do I like him just dropping by unacounced. He'll always be my dad but he just isn't half the man he once was to me. I also just get annoyed because he's pushing anyone away that isn't me even though the literal day before I moved out, he left a note and just up and left us all. I saw how badly it broke my step mom's heart, we had no idea where he went or if he was okay. I had to be the one to beg my grandma to tell me if she knew where he was and tell her all the things he's been doing to his own family. He tried to apologize for all of that but I told him I wouldn't forgive him till he got therapy. He never did and I still try to keep my distance.

But distance these days is more for my own well being. I had a panic attack at work. It wasn't really caused by one thing, it was just a very stressful few weeks that hit me all at once. Now that I know the feeling, the thought of seeing my dad brings that up in me. Every time he calls me drunk feels me with dread. Every time he just texts me out of the blue to talk more about his paranio stuff, my throat gets tight. All the ""Will you do me a favor?"" Just drives me nuts. This is all stuff that just came up in the last few years as his health has been in decline and he's not in the right state of mind. I struggle with the debate in my mind to cut him off. I want to just keep him at arms length but its hard because he claws at breaking that boundary all the time, begging for that family bond that isn't there.

Whether you’re on X end or Y end of the political spectrum, a transphobe or an ally, etc…. Thinking that way is just going to piss off everyone on either side of the trans debate.

I fall on the ally end of the spectrum and hate seeing people who are typically oppressed hypocritically turn around and treat others the same way they don’t want to be treated.

In the live there were actually a lot of ciswomen trying to respectfully talk to the host and the host just wasn’t having it. I can’t fathom the internalized misogyny the host must have. 

Unfortunately, it’s an opinion like that, that gives TERFs ammunition to try to validate their platform. While I don’t agree with their platform, I can see a TERF seeing a trans person quite literally putting down other women and saying, “See, that’s why we believe what we do!” In closing, I’m just upset and ranting. Why do people have to be egotistical and act superior? The golden rule goes both ways in terms of respect. You can’t expect acceptance when you trounce over others like that.

19,108,rant,2023-05-27 04:19:34,kiwilovethekiwis,I have a problem with my transgender partners,"I have a problem with my transgender partner. More than just my partner, I have a problem with the community itself. I’m not here to get into the politics of why I dislike transgenderism, i’m here to tell my story of why I struggle to date anyone who identifies as trans. I have had three girlfriends so far, all of which identify with he/him pronouns. For a lesbian, this is one of the most frustrating things to have to deal with in relationships. As a lesbian, I would like a girlfriend, and nothing other than a girlfriend. I want to tell people I have a girlfriend, I want to talk about girl things, I want to be with someone who can really get deep with me emotionally and understand how I’m feeling. And any lesbian would know that no guy could ever understand a woman’s feelings as much as another woman. Now, I’m all for a total feminine woman as a partner. I do enjoy the raw vibes and energy of a traditionally feminine woman as much as the next guy. But a bit of masculinity is what I find the most appealing. However, nowadays, you wouldn’t believe how difficult it is to find a raw energy, semi-masculine woman in our society that’s still values the entirety of being a woman. Nowadays, young girls are brought up to be confused about their gender identity. As they go through puberty, an age which they are most confused and uncomfortable about their bodies at, they are told that if you just transition or change your gender identity using pronouns then all of your problems and discomfort will go away. This is what they are taught and I have seen this in so many young women. It has gotten so bad that the only women that are semi-masculine and desirable to me as partners are those who call themselves boys and use he/him pronouns. These are the more semi-masculine women who still keep their femininity, exactly what I desire. I have dated three of these women and all three of them, right before our relationship ended, have asked me the same question; “Do you see me as a boy?” When I hear this question I know the relationship is about to go down south. I have given three separate answers to this question, and all three attempts of saving the futile relationship have failed in the same dramatic ways. And every time a new relationship fails, it hurts worse than the last. It got so bad the third time when my partner completely lost her mind after I told her the truth, I didn’t see her as a boy. She sought revenge for the rest of that year until I finally graduated from high school. She tried to take my friends away, ruin my future relationships, And even go as far as to attempt to destroy a major art project I had been building for months in the metal shop out of spite. Luckily she was apprehended by my teacher before she could destroy it. But it was after our relationship that I finally decided I would never date another trans person for the sake of side stepping around the drama and the hurt. Each relationship I had with a trans person went wonderfully for the first few months or so. But in each relationship I had either slipped up or directly told my partner that I was a lesbian. The times I directly told my partners were the times I had trusted and hoped they would be civil enough to have a conversation about our identities. And typically there would be no issue between us for another few months or so as our day to day relationship continued as normal. This is until my partners decide to bring up my forbidden sexuality once again, close to the end of our relationship. They talk about how my being a lesbian is “oppressing” them and making them feel like I don’t value their gender identity as much as they would like me to. Keep in mind, the only time I had ever brought up the fact that I was a lesbian was at the very beginning of our relationships. ONLY at the very beginning. I would never bring it up for the rest of our time together because I knew how sensitive these transgenders were about their identities. The only times my being a lesbian was brought up was by them in order to create conflict. These were the women that I would most frequently fall in love with. They were women that I valued their character and personality over, over any sort of gender identity they were recognized as in society. I loved each one from the bottom of my heart and made it my biggest initiative to treat each one like the center of my world. That’s how much I valued these women as my partners. Without their transgenderism or gender identity confusion, any of those three women could have been my partners for life if everything else flowed smoothly. That is my problem with transgenderism, the transgender community, and my transgender partners. I vowed from this point on to never date another trans person for the rest of my life to avoid the hardships that came with it.

The husband was a woodworker so I suspect he did a lot of it - but it is done very well. 

He did choose to do a drop ceiling with white, old-school, asbestos looking, school type tiles in the den. Which I hate. A lot. Lol! I’ve done some research and it looks like at least the wiring/plumbing? is recommended to be hired out. We have little experience with wiring / plumbing but have done a handful of DIY project fixing up our home since the purchase and are wondering how much of changing this ceiling is feasible for us to do ourselves. 

It looks like drywall is what a “normal” ceiling is and what we’d need to replace it with. Are there other options y’all can recommend?

Would you take on changing this yourself? 

Would you hire it out? 
Parts or the entirety?

We are in Oklahoma and the room is about 180 sq. feet roughly.

1) The HVAC system in that room is completely changed (brand new interior and exterior units). Also asked the HVAC technician if vents need cleaning or have any mold. He said not needed.

2) If AC's running only on fan mode and I take a shower in the nearby room with doors open (this room that smells has the interior AC unit, so all the air is sucked into this room)

However, I wanted to give him something and after a title lawsuit with other relatives, agent fees, etc, my wife and I decided on $50k. 

He doesn't need or want the money right now and wants me to help him get the most bang for his buck. We've looked into buying him a place to live (most likely a condo or trailer park home) but cost of living where he is is too high for $50k to make any kind of dent where he could afford the monthly payments, and he's not quite ready to move yet. 

Question #1 is do we keep this money until he's ready for it or do we gift it to him ASAP?

Question #2 is if we keep it until he's ready; how does growth work when we put it into a HYSA or CD or mutual funds etc? (he'd keep the interest not us). 

Seems like its less complicated if we gift it to him via 4 checks from my wife and myself in 2022 and 2023 and he just takes our advice on how to invest it but there's also concern of him spending it.

The details aren't yet established on the sale of the house but I should be able to give him somewhere between $45k-60k. The original idea was to ""take care of him"". That was what my parents wanted and I am truly excited to help realize that goal.

Where he lives, it is impossible to get into literally any living situation on that small investment. You cant even get into a mobile home park with that. So, the question is; what is the best way for me to help him? Do I....

1) Just give him the money and wish him good luck.

2) Give him the money and have a structured conversation with him about how best to use it, but leave it up to him.

3) Set up a trust or a mutual fund or something else, hand it over to him, and wish him luck.

4) Take an uncomfortable amount of control over this aspect of his life and be like a ""controller of the money"" somehow? Maybe put the money into some scenario where he cant touch it for a certain amount of time. I dunno...

5) Not give him any money, for now, work on growing it under my full control and give it to him at a later date. The idea here being that supposedly me being older means I'm somehow better with money and that I'll just manage it for the next 10-20 years then give him it when ""he's more mature"" and it's much more money and much more impactful and we're all pretending that I can control this entire process and he's in an amazing place in life when I give him the money...

6) Some other idea?

&#x200B;

\* The house is 100% mine. It is not an inheritance. There is no legal requirement to share the proceeds from the sale of the house. Also; I am 100% committed to this idea. He'll get the money; I am just trying to figure out what is the best way to help him out in the long run. I came into money when I was young and I wasted a lot of it. I don't want to burden him with me being some kind of caretaker of his future, but I also don't want to take this opportunity that he has and just throw it away if there's a better option here.

Looking for some car shopping advice here.

Background: I am currently in the market for a car. I would love to have a car that fits my needs and desires(attractive appearance, comfort, sound experience (I’m an audiophile). I am currently full time employed , taking home around 74K post tax. I have 20K invested in stocks currently for taking advantage of the all time lows, I have 5K in a HYSA, employer is currently maximally matching contribution to my 401K. Expecting a promotion in the next few months to up to 77K post tax. I am getting married in 6 months. Expecting to buy a new house in 3 years. 

Test Driving a bunch of cars one that truly fits all my desires is a Lexus IS350, 2021 model that’s slightly used with 14K mileage prices at 43K. A 72 month loan is what I was looking at, with payments coming to around $675-$700/ month based on 7-8% interest rate. After insurance quotes,gas and maintenance expectations this may come to around 17-18% of my income. I’ll still save a decent amount for my future events.

I guess I am looking for advice at whether this is financially wise. I could swing for a lower priced car and sacrifice my desire and wants for 3 years of my young life, and possibly save $8-$10K. But is my rationale for what I truly want and would like financially reasonable to pursue this car?

Sorry if this is not the appropriate subreddit for my question. Could you please suggest where I should post it?

I was supposed to get approximately 15% of my total salary as a fixed year-end bonus at the end of FY2023 at ABC. When I joined XYZ, I informed them about the year-end fixed bonus that was mentioned in ABC's offer letter. XYZ did match my in-hand pay, and there was no fixed bonus or joining bonus. So, I thought I would be getting a basic increment at the end of FY. Now, everyone else has received their increment letter except me.

I had a review 6 months ago in which I did not receive a pay increase, but they did increase my PTO to 3 weeks. I used 2 weeks right away and when I decided to switch careers I took the high road and completed my final two weeks with the expectation that my unused PTO would be paid out. 

I reached out to HR (when I still worked there) to confirm my 5 days of vacation would be paid out, and they sent me a non-answer along with a formula for calculating how unpaid time off gets paid out (earned PTO is pro-rated by the amount of time worked since review (in my case, 6-months) so I would only be paid out 2.5 days instead of the 5 days I had available to use. HR even used my situation in the example formula to explain this. 

I received my final paycheck today and it didn’t have any PTO payouts added on. I emailed HR asking about when they would be sending it, and their response was another formula they use for calculating PTO payouts, but this time they used the sum total of of PTO I was eligible to use throughout the year (120 hours) and it determined I was not eligible for a PTO payout since I was only eligible for 60 hours and I used 72 hours.

My paid time off never accrued - it was available for me to use as soon as my review was processed. I asked my supervisor if he knew of this policy and he said that he didn’t know that was a thing either.

I used to be an amazing student who would get A's and B's in school. I struggled mentally but I still made it. High school hit and my grades began to drop a bit. I wasn't entirely concerned but my parents were, moreso over my grades than why the grades fell; I think they assume I was lazy, which I won't deny, I was to a degree. Around junior year I met a guy (23M) online and we hit it off. Everything was fine up until mistakes were made and our relationship turned sour, which also had an impact on my mental health. I will dive more into that relationship with the guy more in another post that I'd like to write. My grades began to fall due to this toxic relationship and my parents were angry. I was dating an older guy online who still lived with his parents, my grades had tanked, and I did nothing other than what I was required to do (go to school and go to work). Then covid hit and everything just increasingly got worse. Some days I would eat nothing and do nothing. I would watch anime instead of work on school. I had no energy to really do anything. My parents tried multiple times and different ways to separate me from my now ex because they knew some of my struggle was because of him, but I found ways around that. Everything just got worse and worse and it really divided me and my parents. I hated that they hated my then bf and pulled myself away from them. Fast forward to January 2021, I have decided to go to therapy because I believed I was a problem to everyone. My then bf breaks up with me because he can't handle the massive depression and insecurities he's caused me. I in turn want to commit as I felt I had nothing else to live for, he and the toxic relationship we had was all that kept me going at that point. My parents slowly figure this out and try to support me, but they don't understand that therapy isn't going to fix me immediately. I couldn't handle all the regular stressors of life and I especially couldn't handle my parents constantly nitpicking my therapist and my school work when I just wanted to die. So I moved out for a month to my friend's house across the street. This really broke my mom because I didn't tell them all what happened leading up to this, as I wasn't ready and I was still extremely angry at what they said and did while I was in this relationship. I feel very bad that I left my mom feeling like this was their fault and I regret not telling them but I plan to. My friend was my shoulder to cry on during this period and really helped stand my ground while I was going through all of this. I slowly got better and was able to pull my grades up by my bootstraps just enough to graduate. Now, I'd talked to my parents about the plan after I graduated and I was told that I would have a place to stay until I could get back on my feet mentally and financially. They at least understood that I was not ok mentally, until they didn't. After I graduated in May and moved back in, they had told me that I had until July to figure out a place to live and a job to support it. I was dumbfounded, not only had they gone back on their word but I would not have the same luxury as my 3 siblings of being able to save money and learn good spending habits before going out on my own. I felt blindsided. Luckily they told me they'd give me my mom's old car for transport if I graduated and my dad ended up allowing me to move into one of his rental properties and be one of his tenants. Still, these were big steps for me to take after being extremely depressed for god knows how long.

About a year has passed and I'm doing ok mentally and I'm in a much healthier relationship with my current bf (22M) and we are living together. He's a smoker and sometimes I feel like my parents judge me for the type of people I end up falling for. We make just enough to make ends meet but neither of us will likely pursue higher education or, at least at the moment, make much more than what we are now, especially with inflation taking over. I am the least successful out of all their children and I don't know if I will ever make more than any of them.

TLDR: I got into a toxic relationship, got the big sad, grades tanked, parents offered help and then revoked it, but now I'm better in a healthier relationship with a smoker, but really only living paycheck to paycheck while my siblings are much more successful than me and I feel like my parents are disappointed in me because of all that.

P.S. Don't tell me that I'm still young and can change my life around, I've heard it too many times and with inflation, it might actually be impossible to do very much.

So, this was a couple of years ago, it's just something that comes to mind now and again.

I'd like to say I wasn't close with this family member, he was my stepmother's brother. He had a lot of issues from an accident when he was young. He had seizures to a point that a good chunk of his brain was removed to help control them. He wasn't in a good way for a long time as he just couldn't get freedom from his family. If more detail is wanted, I'm okay providing it but this isn't really about him. He did commit suicide one night and wasn't found till the morning. Understandably, everyone was upset. I wasn't close to him but I still felt he didn't deserve to go out that way.

Well, his funeral comes. He was cremated and put in a vault with other ashes in these glass boxes that also had his picture and a few of his things. I remember this well as everyone talked about how they loved him, told stories of him, and then my stepmom played a voice-mail he left for her. That's when this feeling struck me. I had none of that with my own mom. She passed away when I was 18, I'm now 25. I wasn't close with her because she was an addict and neglected me a lot when I was young before my dad got custody. However, I still loved her, she was my mom no matter. I feel guilt for thinking about her during that funeral. I have barely any photos of her, no old voice mails. Just a few letters that read like the ramblings of a mad woman. I wish I had more than that, stuff of hers before she was too far gone. All of her things is with my half sister but I refuse to speak with her. She is an addict as well and believes my dad brainwashed me against them and that one day I'll just return when I'm free of him. She also thinks my mom's death wasn't an accidental overdose and said to me ""She just missed her baby so much"" the day I visited after her death. That still hurts to remember, no one ever wants to believe they are the reason their parent died. My dad told me she has had at least 7 overdoses and this one just happened to be fatal.

I just wanted that off my chest. Maybe there are other people who could understand this feeling of disconnect but the disgust for that half too.",1,3,3,0.8,0,,/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/10uyhy1/a_funeral_made_me_realize_things_i_missed_out_on/,False,True
6,2319,TrueOffMyChest,2021-07-22 18:26:10,linguisticshead,The Autism Community is not inclusive and it is not a community.,"For a bit of context – I am clinically diagnosed with autism and recently I received a ton of hate on social media for sharing some views on the autism diagnosis criteria. It seems as if people forget that having difficulties communicating is a part of being on the spectrum and you are not allowed to complain how fucking hard this is sometimes.

Autistic people with less communication skills are left out of the community. Autistic people who are nonverbal are often not given a chance to participate in a group. I have been trying to make friends in the autistic community for a long time but all I feel is that I don't belong there and that these are not my people and not the kind of activism I want to join. 

Besides trying to interact all the time with autistics on social media, the only time I was able to get their attention was by sharing on my private account an opinion that was slightly different than theirs. I got tons of hate while autistic people are legally being electrocuted in order to change their behaviour!!! I got tons of hate for sharing that I don't mind wearing the puzzle piece symbol while we are still being denied accommodations in Schools and Universities. Why isn't anybody talking about this? Why is it that the autistic community will only interact with me when I say something they don't 100% agree with, even when I am just a University student who has absolutely NO power on how the world views autism? When I am not fucking defending eugenics y'all.

Autistic people with less communication skills are left out of this community all the time, including me. Autistic people who don't agree 100% with other autistics opinions' are left out, are given hate and being ""cancelled"". Autistic people who have more difficulty with communication are not seen on social media, are not included in the groups. Because as much as we try, the autism community is only truly opened for people who can hold a conversation, for people who can share their views on things in a great way and for people who can seem more neurotypical. 

The Autism Community is not a Community. This makes me sad and upset. If this text is confusing, I am sorry, as I said, communication is hard for me and I am just truly upset with the realisation that even autistic people are not always inclusive, are not always accepting. You need to do better, we need to do better. You need to support people with less verbal skills like me and people who have more difficulty maintaining friendships like me.

Now, there wouldn't have been any difficulties, but yesterday, I told my parents I would be going to the cimena and they said i can't.

I feel so stupid for not asking earlier if i could go, and had to let him down like this. 
And i know we can go later, but i feel even more upset, because before we got together, a year ago he asked me out on a date but i friendzoned him, and now, even tho we're together i feel like i let him down the same way, because finally after such a long time, and after i realized my mistakes we started dating. And him asking if we could go to the cinema after all that made me feel so good, but i had to let him down again. I feel so stupid. Idk what to do.

I’ve been having problems with how I feel about both of them but mostly of my father. Me and him have some tension between us because of how different we like to spend are time.  The main concern right now is about my dog who my parents have been having problems over. the main problem happened 3 hours ago at 11:00pm me and my sibling 19y sis 17y sis  and 13 y brother and mom are going on a trip to go to my mom’s side of the family trip together. The problem is that we needed to drop off the dog at my dads because that was the plan all along and my dad knew or should have known that. Unfortunately my dad refused the dog coming over which I did not know this until I was at his house with my dog. He start yelling saying not to bring the dog in the house and saying to leave with the dog now.(my mom drove me over and was in the car) he started filming the interaction for some reason and I was being told by my mom to get in the car and just leave my dog ( ember ) outside (because my dad was outside) and leave. But I was scared because I think he might have just left her out their if just left and we live near a road that cars go fast on so if she got hit she would probably die. He told be “ if you leave her here  then we will have some major issues.” I was crying at this point (I’m pretty sensitive and don’t like getting yelled at) and I was just begging my mom to just take the dog home and just see if we can find someone but my mom said no finally she relented and called my sister boyfriend to ask if he could watch ember and he said yes. On the way home I was bawling my eyes out and I was mad at both of my parents for me being in the middle alone in this just thinking that if I choose one Side I will ruin the other relationship.

I was drinking every day and night and digging myself a deeper and deeper hole into addiction. I dabbled in magic mushrooms a little bit before in my life and one night I figured I’d try doing some alone. Boyyyy, I ended up having a bad trip ( and at the time I thought) the worst night of my life. I went on this weird psychedelic journey through my own head and I told myself things like “I wasn’t worth anything “ or I “don’t deserve happiness”. I thought I saw God and angels and demons… and I’m not religious. This lasted for seven hours and I thought that it was just a bad trip, but afterwards I felt extremely different. It was like my whole mindset on life changed overnight. I began slowing down my drinking, and I stopped smoking as much weed. I started applying myself more at work. I began looking deep into myself and I was actually able to commit for the very first time in my life to my general well-being and happiness. I can dream again, and I have a clear head now. I can actually take a look at myself and see what I am. 

Now I’m not saying “Everybody should go out and eat too many mushrooms!”, but I do feel like it opened a whole new door in my life. I’m happy again. I don’t drink. I don’t smoke marijuana. I stopped worrying so much about my recent breakup. I’m currently in the best place in my life. I don’t attribute it all to that one night, but I swear that my mindset changed for the better, and that’s what is important. Thanks for letting me share Reddit.

No one even asked for my ID while buying anything and I was happy about it but at the same time felt kinda stupid because then it got to the point where I was like: Did I even need to turn 18 to buy alcohol?

For context my mom passed away when i was 4 and my dad isn't really in my life so i was raised by his family. His brother whom i have come around to call papa (unmarried), my aunt (unmarried) and my grandpa. My dad's family never really liked my mom's though they hold conversations and are civil with each other. My parents eloped and married against the wishes of the both families so I guess their under lying hostility for each other makes sense. 

What's so arguably toxic and draining living all these years with them is that though they look after me and treat me relatively well compared to others perhaps who are in the same scenario as me is that whenever i have an opinion against theirs beliefs/actions or when i do something that doesn't seem to make them happy i get called "" don't act like your mother's family and become the bad blood like them"". ""bad blood"" in this scenario is pretty derogatory as if my mother and her family isn't normal humans like any other. I have been hearing this as long as i can remember and though over the years i have come to act as if it doesn't bother me anymore i still feel unwanted when it happens. I haven't felt wanted all this years of my life that I have been living honestly. It always seems like an underlying message of "" we gave up on our own personal lives to raise you so you better make it worth."" Whenever i do something that makes them feel that isn't the best choice or action to do by their perspective i hear pretty awful remarks by them. It can range from "" we are raising you up just because that's what your dying mother wish was"", "" ofcourse you are like any other dumb child, you after all carry your mother's blood in your veins"" to ""We don't care whatever you do, you aren't ours anyways."" I know compared to the awful physical and mental trauma that many live through mine seems almost miniscule and unimportant, I'm in no way ungrateful for the fact they are raising a child that isn't their own but it always doesn't make me feel the best. 

I suffered from unaliving tendencies and SH from age 11-18 because i couldn't deal with all these remarks. Added with the being a perfect kid who gets perfect marks that i had to keep up maintaining because if I didn't i would feel extremely anxious and guilty i fell into depression . (I have been clean for the past one year which I'm very proud of) and had to seek therapy outside their knowledge. They don't really believe that one can suffer from mental health problems. Added with the 2020-2022 covid era my mental health and grades tanked and i felt more isolated that ever. Such taunts, arguments and remarks increased along with some strain in the family dynamics as my granpa started showing signs of dementia then and it affected me a lot. I have been better since then and I'm doing well but things get hard some days and today was one of them so I thought maybe I should get it off my chest here. At the end of each day I'm thankful for the relatively good life that i lead and for all the opportunities it presents but their words never makes to fail me realise that I'm not really wanted anywhere and that them raising isn't something that they chose to do but something that had to given the past circumstances.

Yes I look back now and admit that I was a bit spoiled. My parents worked so they could provide with what we needed and after it was just me mom and 1 sibling. she did spoil me a bit because I was heart broken. I was a daddy's girl to no end. 

Now my older 3 siblings had it a bit rough. I don't know much besides what I've gotten out of my mom because it was rough for her too. But besides some unfortunate major incidents I remember our life being decent. But I always remember one siblings (we will call her M) having issues. 

M was and is a bit of perfectionist. She always had to match her clothes. Her hair and makeup had to be right. Me on the other hand I would just grab and put on whatever. I was always a tomboy and she was our moms girly girl. That never ended well. So our lives were to me at the time just sibling issues. But as I've gotten older and started processing my own issues I realized alot of them come from M. She was my biggest bully. 

I've accepted that she had her own demons she was fighting at the time and probably seen me as golden child while to me that was our older siblings. But somedays when I'm not doing so good and struggling I just want her to say I'm sorry. I'm sorry I hurt you because I was hurting. I know that will never happen. But I feel like it's something I need. I unfortunately do not have a therapist atm and am working through my issues myself. I wish we had a better relationship but I can't change the past and can only look towards the future to hopefully get better.

She's going through some stuff so I suspect it has more to do with her feelings about herself - either that or she's got a big gay crush on me and isn't ready to deal with it so instead wanted to insult me, either that or she's jealous.

Maybe I was too nice to her (she didn't have food and I gave her some, twice, and I helped train her in when she was new and gave her advice about some life stuff) and she resents me for it so now she's being mean?

me(16F) and a close friend of mine(16F) had a big fight about a month ago. It was me who started it because almost our entire friendship she doesn’t text me or talk to me unless i talk to her first, i’ve brought it up twice before we had the fight, i’m not the only one she fought with or had a problem with, alot of her friends also have a problem with that i think.
we would go days without speaking if i don’t reach out first. and if i do, she would take hours to an entire day to respond with a one word message, 2 words if im lucky. 
A mutual friend of ours is on my side, telling me i should ignore her because she’s being incredibly weird and she doesn’t know how to act, the said mutual friend also says that she always texts her, its what convinced me i was being ignored.
After that i started ignoring her. I wouldn’t talk to her or look at her and it lasted for about 2 weeks, and in those 2 weeks she never talked to me in person or online. I blocked her on insta and she never noticed, and there were two instances where she saw me and turned the other way.
Two days before the fight she came up to me and hugged me out of nowhere, telling me that she dreamed that i talked to her, that she wanted to talk but can’t think of anything to say and that she’d speak to me after the weekend in school, the school day came up and she didn’t come to me at all.
in the fight i asked why she never speaks to me and that i always reach out first and that we’ve talked about this before. She says that shes always tired and that she has problems at home, ok understandable. I said that if she had just told me we wouldnt have these problems. She then says that she doesn’t have to tell me, and says that she’s fought with other people about this issue and that the ones who understand, understand. And the ones who don’t can fuck off.
Now every now and then she gives me looks and thats all. she would text my best friend saying that she wants to talk to me but she doesn’t. Just a few days ago she texted my best friend again saying she wants to make up, and that she can’t bring herself to talk to me when she looks at me. My best friend tells her again that im ignoring her because of how hurt i was.
i don’t want to be the one who reaches out, i’m always the one who texts first or reaches out. I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t even know WHY i want her to come back after this entire mess",0,1,1,0.99,0,,/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/13t2w20/i_want_an_ex_friend_come_back/,False,False

Was going to get groceries with my husband, as we are walking to the car in our complex we were approching the stairs we saw a young sister (maybe about 5) and her younger brother (about 2) climbing the stairs together. Something looked very off and as we were getting closer we realized the boy had no underwear or pants on. He was fully exposed and his sister was trying to take him somewhere. My first thought was what the hell? These kids must me lost, why isn't the child wearing anything outside of the house? Why are they alone?

I immediately stopped, asked my husband to go to the car and wait for me while i ask the sister where her parents are and where her apt is so I can escort these kids to privacy. She did not speak English but pointed at her brother and said his name. She wearing traditional clothing. For context I live in the USA and there is a good amount of immigrants in our complex but I had a hunch these kids were from Afghanistan because of their clothing and names, I'm middle eastern and tried saying Arabic words but she didn't understand either. I noticed the apartment they wanted to go to has a huge Afghanistan flag in one of the rooms that I glimsped one day roaming around. The sister seemed pleased to talk to me but we couldn't communicate. The boy seemed distracted and started going down the opposite way and they both looked away and I immediately went down stairs and found their mother. 

Their mother was in traditional clothing, fully covered, and couldn't speak English, I asked if she was from Afghanistan and she nodded, she was smiling and looking extremely weird and soulless. At that point I assumed she was a refugee. She was roaming around far away from her kids and seemed like she gave zero shits when I brought up that her son is naked and he needs to wear something and it's not safe for a child to be like that in public. After a while the Convo was going nowhere and I felt unsettled cos she wasn't doing anything and I made the choice to leave her be. 

I have never seen something like this before, I live in a very hot state during the summer and even then I've never seen a very young child a exposed in such a way IN PUBLIC while people walk around the complex midday, anyone can see him and his mom didn't care. It made me think something deeply wrong is happening in their household and that poor child has no sense of privacy. The mother was fully covered but didn't bother to cover her kid?? Is this shit common in afghan culture? Have u ever seen something like this? I felt so horrible for that kid and I felt like I should have done more but I was honestly too shaken and I did what I could. I don't have kids but I care a lot about child safety and this disturbed me given how many messed up people are out there.",8,6,6,1.0,0,,/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/13t2q4r/saw_something_unsettling_today/,False,False

Last week I was hungry and seen that he hadn't eaten the last of the ramen that I'd left for him and we hadn't gone to the store yet  so I decided that I'd make and eat that for my dinner, thinking I would just buy more whenever he decided he wanted that kind of ramen again, considering I found a store much closer to us thay sells that same ramen. Today after work, we came home and asks where the ramen we got from the store a while back was at and I told him I ate the last of it because it'd been nearly 2 months and he hadn't touched it and I didn't think he was going to eat it. He got upset and has decided not to eat anything. I tried offering other things we had in the kitchen or going to the store to buy the ramen or something else and he refused both options.

So I was driving to the grocery store with my mom in her car. She had surgery recently and was wheelchair bound so she got a temporary handicap tag.

I pulled around looking for a close parking spot, but at first I couldn't find one so I put my blinkers on and helped her into her wheelchair before I went around looking for a parking spot again. She went in and waited at the front for me so I could get the cart and help her with her shopping.

I went around to look for a spot that was relatively close when I spotted a handicap spot that had just opened up. I went ahead and pulled in, and after I locked up and started walking to go inside, a car pulled up next to me and began SCREAMING at the top of her lungs that she needed the spot because she was handicapped, and that I was fraudulently using the spot.

I'm autistic with cPTSD, and shut down the *second* someone starts to shout. So, I go back to the car, and pull out while she's yelling her head off, then park in the waaaaaaay back hoping that she would park and be in before I had a chance to meet with her again. And I figured that I'd just pull the car around when we were done and do the blinker thing again. Not a big deal, right? Wrong!

But unfortunately, by the time I got up to the store door, she was there, screaming her head off at me again. I was mortified. I walked in, still not saying anything and feeling faint bc I'm about to have a panic attack. It took me a second to find my mom with this bitch behind me, screaming 'you don't get to part in a disabled spot?! Who do you think you are?! Son of a b*h! Do you know the distress you caused me?!' I genuinely thought she was gonna try to beat me with her cane.

Of course I don't turn around to tell her I'm about to have a full on melt down bc she doesn't know the distress she's causing me because now I can't even remember that language is part of my capabilities. But regardless.

I find my mom looking at greeting cards and walk up to her as this person is still screaming at me, and take her hand to tell her I'm starting to panic. My mom is a Karen all of her own, and we do NOT have a good relationship bc of how entitled  and narcissistic she is, but this was the one time she actually defended me. And it was a short fight, where my mom rolled up to this woman and started screaming at her until she walked away.

Our next door neighbour owns a border collie, and unfortunately he's constantly at the bordering fence in their small backyard.

Now this is where the issue arises. The border collie barks at Atlas continually for as long as he's outside. He barks at Atlas whenever Atlas is eating, playing, or going to the toilet. Yet the border collie is quiet at most other times. 

Here's the part where I think I might be the asshole. Now I don't think I'm technically doing anything wrong by spending half an hour or more every day playing ball with my dog, but apparently since we moved in there have been multiple noise complaints about the barking.

My partner has ASD and anxiety so he's always worrying about the noise since our dog's presence is the trigger. He thinks I'm being an asshole to our other neighbours for not keeping Atlas' backyard presence to a minimum, considering the situation.

I was speaking to one of our other neighbours about the noise complaints. Both of us agreed that it was warranted. But when I mentioned the above situation, they agreed with my partner and said that we should just take him to the dog park every day instead of once a week so I'm not being asshole by making it worse (paraphrasing, of course). 

I don't know... I just feel like I should be able to enjoy the use of the backyard without having to hear or worry about the near constant barking. I personally have not submitted a noise complaint. We are renting though, so any complaint from others that accidentally adds our address gets back to the real estate, which is part of why my partner is so concerned that he'll only take Atlas out for the essentials as this has actually happened.

Aside from the AH nature of our neighbour possibly keeping the border collie in their small backyard all the time, AITA?

My sister is 14 and gives me money to pay a netflix account for her with my card (she gives me cash, I pay online) because our parents are pretty much control freaks who monitor exactly what and for how long we (especially she) watched on our shared account. When we both still used the shared family netflix account my parents would take it away for almost anything, even watching too much a day in the holidays lol, which pretty much pissed me and my sister off. 

So, she decided she wanted to pay her own account. I didn't contribute to it with my money because my parents now don't control me as much as they used to, but they still do that with my sister, so I started using my card to pay it.

Now, fast forward a few months, to today. My parents have access to my bank account because that's their condition for me getting pocket money. Well, they found out that I am paying for my own account, and after telling me to cancel it because ""they didn't want to pay for it twice"" and me ignoring it they went to my bank account and took almost 70 bucks (the money I spent on Netflix during the last 5 months). I sure as hell was super mad at them but they just laughed it off and told me that since its their money (my pocket money) they can basically do whatever the fuck they want

She’s my X’s sister. We’ve always been close. I’m actively involved in her family. (Two children & Fiancé. )
I recently had a baby-5 months ago 
While I was pregnant I would go see her often Visit 1-2 days & stay a few nights at a time, up until I was 2 weeks away from my due date. I needed to stay home and settle in our new apartment to prepare for my L.O. 
I worked a full time job & drive 40 minutes to see her each day that I go. 20there20back. 
Our partners stay offshore hers for 2 weeks,  mine for a month..She wants company every single day that he’s gone. I felt like with Work, My Personal life, & My first child I kind of needed a break from over extending myself. If I don’t answer/ if I’m not available Marley calls the next friend or family member & they visit her for hours or a night/nights at a time.  

Did I mention Marley doesn’t drive or work? You didn’t ask but, yes, she has a car sitting in the garage. She drives occasionally
She is well & physically capable
She’s a stay at home mom with her 1yr old & 8yr old
I take Marley and Marleys children to doctors appointments/Check Ups, Occasionally the Store & Frivolous Shopping 

Just an example of what she will have me go over for: 

One time she called me to go over because her baby was Crying/Screaming. I was pregnant and literally just got into my house from finishing up a shift at work from 5:30 AM-2:00 PM (No Break and No sitting the entire shift.) As soon as I got there she told me the baby had gas, Marley gave her medicine & needed me to stay a few hours ‘in case she needed to go to the hospital’ She knew how to handle it in the first place. I was pregnant & honestly I can hardly regulate my own anxiety
OR 
The first week after I had my baby & my boyfriend had JUST got home. Picked him up from the airport with his mom, didn’t leave the parking lot yet. She ‘needed’ me to go sit with her just in case her 1 yr old daughter needed to go to the hospital for a cough. 
I’ve told her she could call me if it was a definite need for the hospital. She said she wouldn’t be able to wait for me if it were an emergency. I’d need to be there before hand. Just. In. Case. 
I drive out of my way & have to completely plan around going to see her every single time. 
It’s stressing me out. 
I just want to be home in my own bed. I have so many things to carry back and forth from her house to mine all while having a baby & being the only one of TWO of us to do things like this. It REALLY wears me out. 

So you can see why it gets a little exhausting. I just finished taking Stateboard exams, while kind of feeling like she didn’t understand what it meant for my career. She asked me to go out to the bar an hour away TWO days before my exam. Wanted me to perform services on her like Dermaplane, Tan, Lash Extensions etc. 

I tell myself- she can’t relate. 
To the Self Discipline, Mental Preparation, the money I’m spending on Supplies/Gas for my car.  Not to mention I have a 5 month old I have to be hands on with almost 25/8 

I’m wanting to go back to work & school again. 
 I almost feel like I’m not doing enough when I don’t go see her.. I’ve tried to cut it short by going once or twice every other week. I don’t want to be a bad friend

My friend then fills the used tomato can with water and just pours it in “to get the last of it out”.

Friend and roommate then start making a new bolognese because obviously I was wrong. They use the ingredients *I bought* whole the roommate laughs a little while saying “sorry for just taking over :D”.

7,169,AmItheAsshole,2023-05-27 10:50:33,Scary_Helicopter_611,AITA for asking my roommate to give me my half of our deposit ?," Hello Reddit! I have recently made the decision to leave the expensive city I am living in and move back home. This was a somewhat hasty decision that I made at the end of April, with the intention to leave this summer. I told my roommate right away to give them as much notice as possible, due to the fact they were going to be away for a month visiting family which coincided with my move. I ended up pushing my move date back by a month to help give them more time to sort out what they wanted to do e.g get a new roommate or move out, but the fact of the matter is they get back around two weeks before I leave. While I’m aware this is inconvenient, I gave them more than 3 months notice that this was going to be happening. 

Here’s where I’m wondering if I’m the AH. I recently spoke to the building manager who told me that the only way to get my very large deposit back was for my roommate to give me my half of the money themselves, and than they would take all of it from the building when they move out. As of now my roommate has no intention of leaving here or getting a new roommate. I am moving overseas, and shipping boxes is working out to be much more expensive than I thought. I need the deposit money to help pay for that. I just recently lost my job so have no source of income.

 When I told them this, they said that it was unfair of me to ask them to pay that money right now, especially “under the circumstances I was leaving them in”. I’ll also mention that I asked for 200 less than my half in case there was a cleaning fee or damages they wanted to take out when my roommate moved. There is no significant damage to the apartment so in my mind 200 was more than enough for my half. Roomate argued that if they gave me the money now and were charged more than that 200 later, they’d be the ones getting screwed. To which I replied that if that was the case of course I’d send more money. 

Roommate wants to wait and give me my half of the deposit when they move out. Although we moved into this apartment as friends a few years ago, things have been distant and we haven’t been close in a while. While I’d like to think they wouldn’t screw me over and not send me my half of the deposit upon moving out, you never really know what will happen. I’ll be out of the country, and could literally do nothing if they decided to do that. On the other hand, if they say they don’t have the money right now… what can I really do? But like I said earlier, I need the money to help pay for my move. 

Roommate is arguing that I knew that they would be away for a month and not working as well as having to essentially pay double rent when I leave (as they don’t want to get a new roommate), so it’s unfair of me to expect them to have the money for my half of the deposit.

He has reaped the consequences of his drinking ten fold - sometimes in big ways(near death accidents), sometimes in small ways. I have always stuck by him though, and I have provided a huge amount of empathy and compassion when no one else has. 

In December, he came to meet me abroad. Immediately, the excess drinking started. He behaved incredibly badly ( hyper aggression so intense that he got kicked out of our hostel, took my passport, passed out on the sidewalk covered in vomit and more). 

This night wrecked our relationship. Things were never the same after that. After two tension filled weeks together abroad, he blatantly ignored me for two months. He practically ghosted me. 

I spoke about the incidents and how I was feeling to one of our shared friends. We were talking out of hurt and concern. As a bystander listening in to that conversation, no one would be able to deny that we frikin love this guy. This conversation got back to my cousin from another shared friend who overhead. He was furious with me - told me that I’ve broken his trust. We worked through this “betrayal” and for the first time in months our relationship started to get back in track. 

I had also vented to another one of my cousins about that night. Again, it is not a justification, but I did not tell them to hurt him.

Amanda replies that she can't and says sorry. I ask why, and she says she's gonna tell me a secret. And I ask her what.

I (21F) invited my dad over for dinner a couple of nights ago. We have not always had a good relationship due to him being an alcoholic while I was growing up (he has been sober for nearly a year now). I cut him off when I turned 18 and moved out but we reconciled and have been working on our relationship for the past 2 months. 
  

  
During a conversation about my future plans, I mentioned my career goals and was explaining what university classes I was currently enrolled in when he cut me off and said, “Women belong in the kitchen, not chasing some dream job” and laughed. I was taken aback by this. I asked If he was being serious, and he said “No need to get your knickers in a twist about it”
  

  
In that moment, I couldn’t contain my anger and frustration. I told him his comments were disrespectful and he shouldn’t talk about women that way. He seemed unapologetic and said he was just expressing his opinion and that I should embrace my traditional role as a woman.
  

  
I told my dad that if he couldn’t respect me and support my dreams, he was no longer welcome in my home and that we should rethink if we should be in contact. He left after telling me that I couldn’t take a joke.
  

  
I haven’t reached out to him since but over the last couple of days, I have received a messages from family telling me that I broke my father’s heart by telling him we should rethink being in contact and that obviously he was joking, and I need to chill out. Now I'm feeling guilty and not sure if I should let this go, he's never expressed these views to me before so maybe it’s a one time thing.

I lost my only extended family member suddenly last year. It was a traumatic one. My friends were so amazingly supportive, brought food and sent flowers, came to the services, came to spend time with me and my family. Except my husbands sister that I thought was one of my best friends. Her absence during the whole thing was even more obvious when everyone else was so supportive. I know not everyone has the capacity to pour into another person at all times and have always acknowledged she has a lot on her own plate with 4 kids, but she never even gave a “sorry for your loss” text after I kept desperately trying to reach out and being at such a low point in my life. 

Eventually I confronted her about it because my feelings were hurt and the distance between us kept growing and I wanted to make an attempt to fix it. She told me she couldn’t talk to me about my [addict] family member dying because addicts are a trigger for her and she has no sympathy for them, and also then calling my husband an alcoholic and me an enabler, but also that since she already felt distant from me prior to the loss that she didn’t feel the need to reach out and be a good supportive friend. We never really got anywhere conversation wise, and I was far from ready to be cordial with her after the initial convo. As such I did not invite her or her kids to my sons small birthday party about a month later - it hardly seemed like the time or place to see each other for the first time after such a loaded convo (we already hadn’t seen them for 6 months), but when she found out about it she went off on me in a colorful text and then unfriended me AND my husband on everything and told us to have a nice life.

My girlfriend (24f) and I (24m) went out to a nightclub with one of her friends who I also get along well with.

So as I was really not having a good time, the girls kept wanting to push deeper and deeper into the crowd. So not wanting to kill their fun, but also not wanting to have a miserable time, I said i was going to head to this open spot way off in the back. And I did.

15,177,AmItheAsshole,2023-05-27 09:42:50,Valuable-Custard6374,AITA for the way I react during fights with my SO before my breaking point?,"Recently I've been struggling with my relationship with my SO because we are getting into arguments and fights. I've been struggling to understand who in the situation is the one perpetuating the fighting, myself or my SO. I will give just the fight that happened today as an example of what happens when things get out of hand.
  

  
For some context: Earlier today I was posting on a forum. I joined a debate and was having fun with the topic with a few other people. My SO doesn't understand why I bother posting on the forums, and ridiculed me about it, which he's done multiple times in the past.
  

  
Later, we were looking at houses and I made a comment about one that had an easement on the property, commenting that the property taxes may be lower because of it by a slight amount. He argued it wasn't true, so we looked at a few houses in the surrounding area, and I was correct about the property taxes being lower, but he insisted that I was wrong, despite us comparing the numbers. Then, he tells me that he was the one who said what I said, and that I was wrong because I said what he said. This frustrated me and I said ""What are you talking about. The numbers added up to make my point exactly."" he continues to argue this point, and I tell him that I no longer want to have the conversation and that I'm done and to please stop talking about it.
  

  
He continues to push it, and I continue to tell him I am not having fun and I don't want to have the conversation with him any longer. He then brings up ""How is this any different than your ""debates"" on that forum? you just like arguing with people"". This really got me pissed off so I told him a few more times to please stop the conversation and that it was making me upset and that debating and fighting are two different things entirely. He told me ""You're the one talking about it, it's not me"". I asked him to please stop and to leave me alone a few times again before I couldn't take it anymore, so I told him ""You're a fucking asshole"" and I got up from my chair. I said ""I can not believe you are forcing me to physically leave my house in order to get away from this conversation."" and I left the house with him continuing to yell whatever his side of the conversation was at me as I left.
  

  
This happens so often, and I'm sick and tired of it. I feel like I'm the one causing these fights to start, but I don't know if it's because I actually am causing it, or if he's making me feel like I'm causing it by the way that he's interacting with me. I know that by the end of the fights I've reacted poorly and am definitely a jerk, but I can't pin point whether I am the catalyst of these fights or not. I just feel like I'm going insane.

I was jetlagged, only wanted to see my wife (25f) and go to sleep. I was surprised to see that my MIL (48f) was also waiting with my wife for my arrival at our living room. The second I walk in, my MIL starts complaining about how I was supposed to arrive at 2am, how she has been up for one hour more than she thought she would, etc.. I had sent a message to my wife that my flight was delayed, but my MIL thought that I should have sent her a message aswell, even though I didn't know she would also be waiting for me. My wife calmed her mother down and I told them that I was going to sleep. That was apparently another thing for my MIL to start complaining. She thought that I needed to empty my suitcase before I go to sleep. My wife stood up for me and told her mother that I don't need to empty it right now and I can do it in the morning when I wake up. They argued for a little while, but finally I got my permission to go to sleep from my MIL. At this point I need to say that I left my suitcase closed and it was out of the way, standing near a wall. 
Fast forward to next morning, when my wife and I woke up to a scream from my MIL. Both of us got straight up from bed and went to see what happened. My MIL stood horrified in the middle of our living room and she was looking at my suitcase, which now was laying open on the floor. My wife asked what happened and my MIL responded that she had ""accidentally"" spilled coffee in my suitcase, because I had left it laying open on the floor. My wife and I both knew she was lying, because I did not leave the suitcase like that. I looked at my suitcase and immediatelly realised that the amount of coffee in my suitcase didn't match the size of the cup my MIL was holding, because the cup was small and there were lots of coffee in the suitcase. I started crying, because everything that I had in the suitcase was ruined. My MIL started saying I was overreacting and I shouldn't have left my suitcase laying around like that. She said I was an AH because I blamed her for what happened. At this point my wife kicked her mother out and comforted me. 

Now that few days have passed, I have started thinking that maybe I overreacted and it really was my fault that my MIL spilled the coffee in the suitcase. So am I the asshole?",29,13,13,0.93,0,,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13t33kp/aita_for_getting_my_mil_kicked_out_after_she/,False,False

My buddy (m21) had invited this girl (21) he'd been fwb with in the past to hang out with a bunch of our friends. Hangout eventually ends and me, my buddy, and the girl all head back to my buddy's place. We had a few drinks and smoked a little before calling it a night. I crashed on an air mattress in the living room while my buddy and this girl take his bed. (They're friends and share the bed fairly often, and have never done anything but sleep in said bed when people stay over after hanging out)

 Now his place has a really open floor plan, so his bedroom is pretty open so I can hear everything thats happening in there. He and I have a system. No sex when the other is there, neither of us wanna hear what the other sounds like in the sack lol.

 We laid down for bed and I ended up scrolling for a few before I heard something weird from his bedroom. Tonight was apparently the night he stopped giving a fuck about our rule because I could hear him and her groaning and her quietly gasping and his bed creaking FOR 20 MINUTES. I sent him a warning text that I could hear ""something"" but I ended up having to yell at them that I could hear them.

 They got really quiet and said they weren't doing anything but I ended up saying that they weren't being subtle and should cut it out since I can hear all of it.

 NOT 10 MINUTES LATER I HEAR IT AGAIN, albeit quieter this time. I texted a different friend and told her what was up and she told me that I should definitely just head home. So I lied to my buddy and said my roommate needed a ride home from his girlfriend's place but he said that he could tell I was lying and to just tell him the truth. I told him I didn't like hearing whatever was happening in his bedroom and that it kinda grossed me out.

 He said that nothing was happening and they were just making out.

 I tried to explain that I don't want to be at his place when he's doing stuff like that and he seemed upset that I thought that ""anything like that"" was happening. 

I get that I don't know what exactly they were doing in there, and I have a lot of stuff weighing heavy on me recently so I could have just snapped over something small.

My boyfriend and I have been together 4 years now, we knew each other for 5 years before dating so he is someone I know very well and trust deeply.

Last August, I saved up $1,500 to use as a down payment on a 2015 Toyota Camry, I loved that car so much. It was the first I ever had a nice car. My only other car was a 2003 Ford Ranger that needed a lot of love so I was excited to get a car that I didn't have to worry about so much about having issues.

Anyways, two weeks ago, my boyfriend and I were heading home from work. We stopped at the nearby Walmart. It was dark out, we were waiting at a stop bar to turn left into coming traffic. He was driving at the time and I was the passenger. Lanes looked cleared, saw no one coming and then, out of nowhere, the airbags deployed. This woman came up on a hill and hit the front of my car. Her airbags didn't deploy for some reason. The accident details aren't that necessary to the story, just the cops deemed it my boyfriend's fault. I had full coverage so my insurance just paid the loan off on that car and I'm out the already $2k I put into the car.

Now, to today. For a good week, we were looking into buying me another car but like one someone is selling. My boyfriend offered me the $2k he saved up to help me since I had to miss a lot of work this last month because of an eye injury. He moved in to my place with my roommate so rent is cheaper, I pay nothing on car insurance, and my boyfriend does let me use his car(04 Volvo V7 with over 230k miles on it). Problem is that today, I told him I wanted some time to myself, to process my emotions on everything and just relax. So, he decided to go take a look at motorcycles for fun, he loves them. The issue starts there. He is debating on getting one and I'm feeling crossed at the moment. He said he would give me his car as long as I want till I save up money to get my own car. Ever since the accident, I've just felt hollow. I come from a very controlling family, I had to fight so hard for every inch of freedom I could get. They charged me so much in rent that saving up money was hard, I had to move out with the help of my roommate's dad. So, being able to save up money to get the car I wanted and to have lost it, it hurt. I don't know how to feel now. I'm jealous my boyfriend might get a bike, something he's wanted for so long after he totaled a car I worked so hard to get. He did offer to still use the $2k he had to help me get another car, I'm still looking at used cars but the waiting game is so hard and I'm just so drained these days. It also doesn't help that the doctor I've been seeing about my eye(the injury is still healing but I'm cleared to work) wants me off one of the three days I work(3 days, 12hr days) and I can't work my side job yet because they didn't send a piece of this welcome kit(its a delivery service). So, I'm just feeling so lost.

Edit: The $2k I mentioned is not my money, its still his and if I find a car for that cost, he will pay it and I will pay it back to him over time. Its more so just a loan form him.",13,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/na5wfo/boyfriend_totaled_my_car_moves_in_and_now_might/,False,True

We’re both US citizens but my fiancé is also a Japanese citizen - I haven’t been lucky enough to find a job to sponsor my visa here, so we’ve decided to get married so I can stay on the spousal visa until we return to the US later next year.

My parents who both live in the US decided they absolutely need to attend our marriage license appointment at the govt office here in Tokyo. We’re planning on having a “real” marriage with family/friends in winter of next year when his job transfers us back to the US. However, as I’m an only child and my parents are pretty old they’ve decided they just can’t miss out on this little milestone of the paper wedding.

Issue is, I think we’re making my fiance’s mother feel obligated to travel here as well for the marriage paperwork. She previously expressed that she really doesn’t care about this part of the process - but now that she hears that my parents will be flying out, she feels like someone from their family is “obligated” to show up as well. 

My fiance’s parents and younger siblings all live in the US, and although the father is verrry distant I know his mom has worked a bit harder at staying close. Fiancé repeatedly says he doesn’t need anyone from his family to show up for the paper wedding as it’s just a formality for my visa.

He was always upset if I didn't reply on time nd when I took a holiday he was suspicious of my friend cause he didn't get to speak to her. But we were talking only 3 weeks at the time..

Things felt quick but I said I'd try since he seemed sweet and making effort . We started having arguments recently . He didn't like how I'd be upset when he'd do something. When we argued he had called me all forms of names and apologised and I accepted.  About 3 days later we argued again because he was angry that I picked a call while we were talking (urgent 1 ) and y didn't I tell him straight away on the phone. He hung up on me about 5 times. Told me to go do whatever secretive thing I need to do.

Next day I was upset and told him he was rude and he said sorry for yesterday.  I told him am upset cause not long so he was also shouting at me and telling me to shut up and called me liar (over small misunderstanding)then again shouting and name calling.

How can we get over this road blocks together?,"We’ve been dating for 2 1/2 years and when times are good, they’re amazing and when times are bad, they’re really bad. She’s very insecure so I used to keep things from her because if she found out she would be mad. she found out anyways, and obviously was very mad, an example of this is she did not like me having female friends and texting them so I would hide the amount I texted them (it was only a few times a week, but she felt like I was prioritizing them over her). 

Nevertheless, it’s been a long time since her and I have had these arguments, and I am becoming more open and honest with her. 

All of a sudden she has brought up that she still doesn’t forgive me for this, even though I tell her that I am actively working on getting her trust back, and just being an overall better boyfriend. She keeps fixating on that I lied to her and it really doesn’t help her and I grow a better relationship together. I’m not sure how I can move on with her and ensure that things will get better.

I say again because 3 years ago were also in a relationship. I broke it of at that time because he was a huge smoker en lied to me all the time. Now i have to admit I really missed him in those 2 years and when he contacted me I was willing to try again.

Now the issue ain't with the lying anymore. He has been brutal honest since we started dating again and I appreciate that. It's the fact I think he stopped trying to do his best for this relations because. I think the reason is because we already dated once he doesn't have to ""court"" me or something and just takes me for granted.

Some examples: everytime he is coming to my place he is always late or there is something more important to do then comming over. I am talking 3-4 hours later, every single time. Whenever he promise to do something it is not happening. If he promise to call te next day, he won't. If he says he has a suprise for me, he got nothing. In the beginning he would message me goodmorning and goodnight and we would talk through app all the time and call me a lot about things, but after a few weeks I get almost no text and he only calls me late at night after his work.

When I confront him about it he calls me crazy. He says I never talk about my problems with him. But when I do, he just sight and says he can't deal with this right now and I just have to give it a place on my own. 

Last week I was done. I coulnt handle crying myself to sleep every single night. I called him up and said I didn't wanted to do this anymore and I wanted to break up. He got defensive and said that we can talk about these problems right after he got back from a camping/ small music festival. He needed some time for himself to think and I understands that, because it was already a planned trip for him to be alone with his thoughts. He also said we will talk when he get back and he will try to change. So i agreed.

Now the night before he was about the leave I called him up. Only to find out he is not going to this music festival alone like he planned to, to be alone with his thoughts. He is going with his usual group of music festival friends. In about three weeks he will go again to a bigger music festival with these group. He lied to me saying he is going there to get some rest and peace and even cancelled going to Paris with me to do so. All for something that he will do again in 3 weeks.

I am devestated. I coulnt talk with him about this because when I tried talking about it the night before he was tired and said i need to deal with this on my own until I get back. Now I don't want to have this conversation and ruin his days there (even tho this happened). But I feel broken. I will be leaving to Paris on my own tommorow so I dont know when I have a change to talk. I don't know if I can handle talking to him, because I know he will not listen, blame everything on me and just let me deal with it alone.

I do love this man. I really do. I wished we could have a future together. But if he never shows me love, if he always puts me on last place I dont think I can handle that.

13,189,relationship_advice,2023-05-27 10:26:12,Glittering_Abalone50,My boyfriend (M25) said I (F23) cause his depression,"On new years I asked my boyfriend of 3 years how he looked back on the passed year, and he out of nowhere said it was a very difficult and terrible year for him. He could sometimes look stressed and then I would ask him what’s wrong and comfort him. To me it just seemed like a normal stressful day or week. But apparently what he told me then wasn’t all that was on his mind. I’m always there for him and have never given him a reason not to trust me, why didn’t he let me help him? He told me that when the time is right he would tell me, so I waited.

Fast forward almost 5 months later. He would often turn cold and be really rude to me. If I asked him he was ok he would say I am asking him too many questions, not to worry and to leave him alone. I was walking on eggshells. Last week I talked to him about this and that it’s very difficult for me to understand his cold behaviour without knowing the reason why. He then told me “you wanna know the reason for my depression? It’s you”. I only replied saying “oh, ok. That’s not what I expected.” I tried my hardest not to show emotions cause he would then maybe say “see?? That’s why I didn’t want to tell you”. So I just took it and eventually we came to a solution (i have to change). 

He said I caused his depression by being disrespectful. I started uni again in September to work on my future and have made some new friends (mostly guys, I major IT-security there are only like 3 girls in the whole year). Also I’ve been into going to raves sometimes. On average I go to one every 2 months, tell him with who, send pictures and he has my location 24/7. He also knows my phone password and told him he can see my phone whenever he wants. 

Also apparently I ask too many questions (he doesn’t want me to ask how his work was when he comes home, how his meeting went etc). And I’m rude. He is Japanese and the way I talk and my opinions are sometimes too much for him. I can say in my friend group I’m known for being calm. 

I’m just really hurt I can say I always do my best for him and hearing that you’re causing the person you love depression is not really nice. Also my mom passed away this april and handling both these things is a lot. I have no energy left over I’m exhausted. 

My boyfriend can be so kind, funny and he helped me through so many things. We’ve been living together for more than 2 years now and it’s the first time I’ve really felt like I have a home. I love him but I don’t like this side of him. He can sometimes completely flip his personality and it’s scary, like laughing at me in my face while I share feelings saying “why you always crying”.

I just want to try to fix this if I can. Losing him might be more than I can handle. We’ve been dating about 1 1/2 years.

So to start, about a month ago, I made a horrible mistake. I got way too drunk at a house party, and was convinced by girl friends of mine to kiss a few of them. I don’t remember doing it, but I’ve been told it was 2-3. I would have never done this sober. I’m straight, no doubt about it. Immediately after I did it, I told my boyfriend and started apologizing. I felt horrible, especially because some of those friends told him he should just forgive me and let it go, “because I was exploring my sexuality.” I wasn’t. I know I’m not interested in women. I’m just a shitty girlfriend who doesn’t control her impulses when drunk.
The next day, when we were both sober, we talked. He said he forgave me, and asked that I lessen my contact with those friends, which I did. I still felt guilty, and continued to apologize, but he said it was okay. Things were off since then, but I thought it was stress from graduating and starting work.
Tonight, he called me while drinking with his friends and said he really was having a hard time forgiving me. We talked and are going to talk more tomorrow, but he said he loves me but what I did just hurt him a lot. Which is reasonable. What I did was unforgivable and I don’t deserve his love or his forgiveness. But I desperately want to make things right and to start healing. I have no idea what to do or how to start it. I absolutely hate myself for what I did. It breaks my heart I hurt him. I just don’t know what to do.

17,193,relationship_advice,2023-05-27 10:13:54,No-Matter5594,Libido mismatch with my (22F) boyfriend (24M). What to do about it?,"I have no idea what to start from, but I really need outside perspective on the current sexual dynamic I have with my boyfriend. The situation is very complex and it’s hard for me to tell every single thing that I think contributed to where we arrived now, so if something is confusing please don’t hesitate to ask a question.  
Important information before reading: We’re in our 20’s, we started living together a few months ago and were long distance for 2 years before that (different countries)  
To put the problem simply at first: Me and my boyfriend have very different libido. This generally applies to our sex life, but specifically to penetrative sex. I, as of now, have pretty much no need to have penetrative sex, contrary to my boyfriend.  
There are several things that are affecting my situation: From the beginning, penetrative sex was painful for me. My boyfriend did not rush me to have sex (I was a virgin when we met), we really took our time and he cared about my pleasure a lot, we bought dilators etc. so I could be as comfortable as possible. What’s very important to mention was that we were both interested in more kinky sex, he had experience with it but I only had fantasies about it. My perspective now (this is not how I felt back then) is that I did not have a good enough understanding what sex like that makes you feel like in real life and how to deal with it - this intensity was fun to watch or talk about, but in real life causing me slight pain/talking to me in a degrading way was different. Wanting him to be satisfied and seeing him happy and into it in my head was more important to me than thinking if this is actually pleasurable for me. At the time, there was still an adrenaline rush to it, he always asked me for consent (which I gave) and we talked about what we were doing. In general, I would say I have a lot of regrets about that time and I’ve talked about it, but I do not think he ever actually understood how this impacted me.  
While we were still doing kinky things and having more rough sex, he has done something I have specifically asked him not to do before because it made me feel bad - he put his hand on my throat and slightly squeezed. When he did I kind of zoned out (not because it was strong just out of shock I suppose) so we continued for a bit longer, then I stopped it and he said that he “was so close to cumming” (We both don’t cum from penetrative sex but that’s a different story). I talked with him how that was not ok and he apologised and I brought up that situation several times since then when we talked about our libido mismatch. This was basically the moment when I stopped wanting to have any kinky sex and every time we had missionary sex since then (like that time), I cry. It usually happens as soon as I see him “get into it” the way he did at that moment. It just makes me feel very depersonified, like I am not a person he loves, but a thing to fuck.  
Now, we’re in a situation where we try to have penetrative sex once a month and usually it ends quite quickly with my crying or being just about to do it. He comforts me, he hugs me, he is there for me when it happens. I have incredible guilt built up inside of me anytime we have a conversation about us not having sex anymore that I am not satisfying him. I have no idea what to do - I would love to go to a sex therapist, but we are both very poor and there is literally no disposable income we have besides the one for groceries and rent. I love this man incredibly and I know I want to fix it and he feels the same, but it feels like there is nothing I can do about these things. I feel like for both of us it’s this gruelling feeling that we cannot do anything about this anymore even though we want to and we love each other. It just feels some stupid to end a relationship when there is still so much love left and you grew together so beautifully over one thing (significantly, but nevertheless one) not working well.  
I don’t know… I am thankful to anyone that made it this far. Did any of you have similar stories - something you partner did put you over the edge and you just could not do kinky stuff anymore? Is there any way out of this where both parties are happy? Besides this, I would love to hear from any women who have vaginismus etc. on how they manage to have sex regularly and pleasurably. Thank you so much for any advice!  
TLDR: My boyfriend has way higher libido than me and is more interest in kinky sex. My interest in it faded due to a few situations between us and due to the pain I experience at the beginning of sex.

From what I can best describe my vision is looking through clouds. i make six figures from rental properties, investment and disability benefits. I also have a connection with a premium airline that allow me to havve significant discount on any flight and accommodation. Anyways, I met my ex girlffriend (26f), let's call her Jen, through a mutual friend and I found her to be very sweet and caring. Our friendship grew closer and we starter dating. She knew I was legally blind and I asked her if she was sure as I might be too reliant on her. She took her time and said yes. Due to my past relationships where I was being taken advantage of, I decided not to disclose my real income and flight benefits. I only told her my income was around $50k and that i own one rental property. Our relationship was great and i made sure not to be reliant on her but she insisted on helping me whenever I struggled with navigating around places and ordering food. To reward her for being a great partner, I bought her luxury gifts and overseas trips together. She was very happy which also made me happy. However, after six months of dating, she suddenly told me she realised she wanted to have an independent partner and did not want to be seen as someone who is dating a blind person so she broke up with me. I was heartbroken but I understood. Fast forward to four months later, I invited four close friends of mine on a trip to Japan as a way to move on and spend quality time with friends. All flights and accommodation were paid by me. The trip happened last week and we had a good time. My friends were very accommodating to me and grateful for my generosity. Jen  found out about the trip from IG story posted by one of my close friends. She asked my friend about it and they told her that I paid for the whole trip and that's where she found out that I have flight benefits and I make more than I originally told her. She called me to confront me about it saying if I told her the truth she would have stayed with me. I explained to her that i have been taken advantage of in the past and that I did not want to be treated the same again. She was angry and said she is not that kind of person and that I will never find a partner ever then hung up. My friends said she is clearly a gold digger. I forgave my friend who told Jen because they thought she knew. I question myself whether or not keeping my high income and flight benefits secret was the right thing to do and if i should be honest about it in any future potential relationship.

10/07/22 6:57am

The sky went pitch black. The moon appeared, full and shining. 6 stars glowed around it, then went dim. Then 12 starts glowed around it, then went dim. The moon turned to the dark side and was completely black but still visible. A map of the earth appeared on its slightly brighter surface, with Italy glowing bright gold. The rest of the map was black and gray. I thought to myself, ""is she from there?"" I didn't know who I was thinking of. In the dream, I tried to write these things down in my phone, but when I opened it there was text automatically pasted. It said, ""Counting the days of the goths, beware the woman of the east."" Then I woke up.

Some of my current thoughts:

The phrase ""the goths"" sounded odd to me. I thought it was referring to the modern style goth and because of this sillyness I almost didn't record the dream, but I felt compelled to. I did some research after this and found out the goths were a people. They had something to do with the fall of the western Roman empire, which seems relevant due to the highlighting of Italy in my dream. Also ""from the east"" could that be referring to Italy? Typically I don't think of Europe as from the east, but it is east from my location. I thought at first of the current protests for women's rights in the Middle East, but the text said ""woman"" not ""women"" so perhaps that is unrelated. Maybe Italy/Rome is symbolic of the US?

I can usually interpret my dreams fairly well and draw easy patterns to recent events, memories on my mind, subconscious things I might be processing. But this one came out of nowhere. Maybe just random bits of imagination firing away in my sleep? Can anyone attest?

For information: pre-bed dinner was a quesadilla and hot dogs. I always eat very late and I tend to prefer carbs specifically so my dreams are more vivid and I have better control over them, and a more active imagination the next day, so it's likely that has something to do with it.

3,1198,Dreams,2022-08-21 03:34:09,The_Teacat,Anxiety after strange disneyland dream.,"I dream a lot. Vivid visualisations and lucid dreaming come easy for me, so my dreams tend to be nearly-complete (if slightly strange) storylines in my head, usually like small movies or layered dreams, and while they're all mostly different and rarely even feature me at all, there are some recurring elements that have formed into their own little dreamscapes or nightly anthologies.

(Yes, I have a lot of dreaming practice. It's a very important skill for me to cultivate.)

One major element is Disneyland. I dream about different parts of an alternate version of it, different sections each time but always the same alternate version of it.

I've never dreamed about entering the park, though. Now I have, and it...did not go well.

The entryway ticket booths here are now in an enclosed room, like a security checkpoint at a small airport, and you have to run your bags through an x-ray scanner while they check your ticket like one too.

But my ticket wasn't working for some reason. My bag got stuck until they could verify the ticket, and I couldn't leave back out the front until they were sure who I was either, so I told my family to go on ahead while he fuddled with my ticket and I'd catch up when it was all settled.

Only, I eventually fell asleep in the ticket line. When I woke up, it was just past 10 at night and the park was still open but closing very soon.

He tried my ticket a few more times, my bag is still stuck, and finally, they call security, a team of two women and one man, who show up and take me to what looks like a dank kennel beside the bank on main street. I think things are going well, but the man leaves and when he comes back, he's holding a taser and they say I'm going to get tased so can I please stand still, and put a ""hot pad"" on my head, which looks like a defibrillator pad mixed with a blood pressure testing wrap. They tell me it'll hurt worse with it but it's harmless, and he tases me and I get knocked to the ground, my jaw clenched, and not least of all, I can feel this horrible burning pressure at the top of my head where I guess the pad must've absorbed the tase or something.

Anyway, I've never been tased but my dreams are as vivid as they come, so I can feel every inch of it and it hurts like hell. He tases me again before finally letting me go, and I'm able to walk back to the front gate. Management's waiting there for me with the ticket taker guy, and they're all still figuring out what to do with me, since it's just past 11 now and I can't leave until they let me in, and I'm just trying to figure out why the hell they had to tase me to figure that much out.

Manager and the ticket guy joke that I'm ""like that Tom Hanks movie where he gets trapped in an airport"". The Terminal; but I'm not laughing. It's late. My family's gone. And I'm stuck at the front gates of Disneyland for something I didn't do and no one can figure it out.

4,1986,Dreams,2022-01-13 05:15:35,introvertedfreak21,Ever had a dream that felt too real to be a dream?,"So, last night I had a dream that had really stuck with me, even now that its late in the day. The dream felt too vivid, too graphic to be something I haven't seen or heard. Consider this a warning as that dream is graphic and mentions things some may find unsettling.



Now that the warning is there, I shall describe the dream.

It was like I was watching a tv show but there was no TV I was looking at. Like I was simply watching this older man who is a teacher. I could feel the wicked intentions he had in his heart, the unsettling things he wanted to do to children. He had volunteer to be a chaperone for a overnight field trip for his school. Its pretty hazy what happened on the trip until it was night time. The man finally seemed to be losing control over his urges, I knew what he wanted to do and only hoped it wouldn't happen.

He went to the boy's area, where the young boys were all sleeping. I'm not sure exactly why, but he thought it best to climb through a window, going so far as to remove the whole glass window itself. However, he was unaware that the window was a recent admin. Things are going to become graphic now.

As he climbed through the window and landed on the ground, a large clunk of the window pane broke off and stabbed straight into his back, closer to his right shoulder. It was not a small piece, blood was pushing it's way out his body around the wound. His screams woke up the boys but they were all so young, they didn't know what they were seeing in the dark. He begged them to call 911 but the kids, so frightened, ran out of the room to find other adults. The man somehow was still able to move, he kept trying to get back off the floor but kept slipping on pools of his own blood. He eventually managed to get up and out the small room, desperately looking for help before he bleed out. He didn't make it far before he had passed out form blood loss. By the time EMT's arrived on the scene for the man, he was gone. He had simply died from blood loss.

Now, to me, this dream just felt very graphic. I rarely have violent dreams like that, my dream are usually around things that happened in the past for me or just really outlandishly vivid. This just feels so out of place, I don't dream such unsettling things. I remember even in my dream, I tried to look away as the man was dying. It just felt too real, like it was some new article I read or some video I briefly saw. I'm not sure.",1,3,3,0.81,0,,/r/Dreams/comments/s2rczq/ever_had_a_dream_that_felt_too_real_to_be_a_dream/,False,True

But a short explanation is that every now and again, I have dreams with my ex in it. Usually I feel nothing at all for him, sometimes being creeped out by his presence but this time is different.

Usually when I remember the dream, its just that I am aware he was there but this time, his face was clear as day to me, I can even see it now. I'm not sure if that's how he looks now, he most of the time had really short brown hair and clean shaven face when I last saw him because he was part of the ROTC in our high school. But for some reason, in my dream he had short blonde hair and a growing in beard.

I was invited to his little brother's birthday party(he was the youngest of the family though, so don't know why that is). I could tell he looked at me with this hungry look and I felt embarrassed by it but at the same time, it felt good to be wanted. I woke up before much happen and a lot of dream is lost. I'm starting to think my brain is just using him as a distant familiar face to express something I need or am lacking. I came to this conclusion because during the summer months, my current bf has no real sex drive. While I have a very high one during those months so it causes a bit of discourse between us because I want to feel wanted and he can't fake that kind of thing. There are also problems between us two but its nothing serious and all really tie back to financial issues.

I have no romantic feels for him anymore, he heavily burned that bridge and I've been in a 5 year old committed relationship so it doesn't feel romantic. A lot of the dreams are of him chasing me in some kind of way, a few have been just us being friends again like we use to be before we ever dated, and some felt like he just needed to tell me something but I always got pulled away before he could.

The most recent dream I had was last night. It was just us hanging out again, doing something art related as we were both artistic people. When he turns to me and starts begging I give him another chance, telling me he misses me and all these things. I just keep saying no, that I love my bf and I don't wanna leave him. I don't know why this keeps happening, I haven't seen my ex in at least 4 years, last thing I heard about him was that he had a bad accident that shattered his left arm(he was a left-handed) at work and now he can't lift more than 20 pounds with that arm form all the messed up nerve-endings.

7,2993,Dreams,2022-07-22 16:40:19,MoonyGraham37,"Hanging out with Eddie Munson in my dreams, apparently…","Basically the dream went like this:
Like in Stranger Things, Eddie Munson was on the run for ??? but he was innocent. I don’t remember there being a threat of Vecna but I also can’t remember who else was around so who knows.
Apparently Eddie or someone had a grandma that could hide Eddie, so we all piled in a red car to go there. I volunteered to sit in the middle of the backseat because I wanted to sit next to Eddie (he was on my left side), but I didn’t make that part obvious. I remember the whole ride I wanted to hold his hand or give him some sort of contact and I was really trying to talk myself into doing it.
We had to stop somewhere (maybe a gas station?) to get something and again I volunteered to stay in the car with Eddie (since he couldn’t go in because he’s a wanted man). When everyone was gone, we kinda just vibed in the car together. There was a skylight or a overhead window and we were picking out shapes in the clouds (I think I found a hedgehog but he found a cloud that definitely had giraffe spots). During this, I plucked up enough courage to lean my arm against his and I remember just feeling really safe in that moment.
And then I woke up lmao

I know how Eddie got there - I have a friend that I kinda can’t stop thinking about that reminds me a lot of Eddie Munson, plus Stranger Things/Eddie Munson is everywhere right now, so that explains that. And the thought of plucking up the courage to hold this specific friend’s hand in a car was something I had thought about the day before, so that makes sense.

Also the drug is made up and has imaginary effects that real drugs don’t have.).. when they take it they say they feel as though they are tiny. They are gallivanting around the limo as tiny people- swimming in drinks, climbing noses, trying not get squashed etc.. they try persuading the boss Tony to take some, but he is secretly scared and tells them he shouldn’t as he must make sure they don’t do anything stupid. He scolds them for even asking him, and they say sorry and continue without him. Even their business associate Nicola is taking it. She is sad Tony isn’t taking it because she’s always had a crush on him and wants to seem him have fun. He has never looked at her romantically however and refers to her only for work. 

One of the more mischievous gang members has the idea to spike Tony’s drink when he’s not looking. He manages to pull it off, and waits. After a short while, Tony takes a sip of his drink, and then shrinks down to tiny level. He’s having fun. He isn’t much annoyed because he’s amazed at it. However some ugly looking mosquito starts trying to attack him, and his tiny body can’t fend it off. Suddenly the mosquito is punched and destroyed by another bug. It’s a little green shield bug looking thing. Tony looks at it in amazement. He has never been protected before, he was always the one doing the protecting. He wants to hug the bug. However the bug starts talking, and reveals that it’s actually Nicola in small form. Tony withdraws when he realises it’s her. But then she saves his life again, and he can’t resist being friendly towards her. They are having such fun together in small form, and they keep taking the drug to stay that way. They are about to have sex, however during it, Tony starts to feel she molested him. He is upset and hurt and walks away. I’m not sure why he feels this way.

While dreaming my girlfriend woke me up sexually, but then once she was finished I ran to my laundry room because I thought I heard my washing machine flooding. It was, so of course I started laying towels down when suddenly I heard my garage door open and I saw a group of about 4 men standing next to their car. I told my girlfriend about the people in the garage and she went out there and was so calm about it. I told her to call 911 because when I tried to my phone wouldn’t connect to dispatch. As I was trying to call 911, I realized all the lights in the house were off and wouldn’t turn on. So I went to the breaker and started flipping the switches to no avail. While doing this, I heard 2 other men trying to open my front door. So I ran to my bedroom and grabbed my rifle and kept telling my girlfriend to call 911. 

After I grabbed my rifle I went back towards my front door and shot off about 10 rounds but they all missed and he kept coming in. I ran back into my room and was followed by these guys and then they started pistol whipping me.

15,203,Dreams,2023-05-27 08:22:51,Cyanide850,Elrditch deity spoke to me,"I dreamt I was deep in some woods. It was sunset. There was a huge cabin, more akin to a guest house, next to a lake. The lake had dried, leaving a muddy goop where there once was water.

Me and some other people were watching the mud on the dock that went into the lake. We thought something was hiding in there.

Someone else came over, telling us to stop fooling around and get back to the house. As soon as they left, though, we all saw a giant fish-like head emerge from the mud only to quickly sink back in. We looked at each other stunned. For some reason I knew what would happen tonight.

I went to the house. I thought that I should warn everyone else there, but I didn't, for some reason. Maybe I was worrying only about myself or thinking they wouldn't believe me. I wandered the maze of a house until night soon arrived.

I knew I had to get out of there. I left the house, turned on the flashlight on my phone and ran away into the woods. I didn't make it very far. My light started to dim and I heard noises all around me. I ran back to the house.

When I got there, I saw a handful of people surrounded by monsters, I suppose. Those same monsters came up behind me and I was forced in with the other people in the center. We were all surrounded. There was someone heavily injured on the dock. Everyone else must have been dead by then.

I didn't get a clear look of the creatures surrounding us, but angler fish come to mind - large mouths with sharp teeth and big bulging eyes. They were approaching us until they suddenly stopped.

Something happened then. We were elsewhere. The ground had changed into this slimy fleshy texture, covered in veins, tendrils and puddles of dark liquid. The sky was full of giant tubes made of meat with strange stars behind them. Everything was in shades of violet and purple.

The deity was also there, floating in the sky.

It's hard to describe the thing. It's body shape was humanoid, but it had no face. It looked as if you'd asked an AI to generate a human made out of only H.R.Gieger art. It carried what looked like a scythe made of flesh. The blade though, true to Gieger's style, looked more phallic than an actual weapon.

I think I screamed at it to stop this and return everyone who had died. It responded then. I wish I remembered it's response word for word, it seemed important. From what I can remember though, it went something like:

""What's happened has happened. There is nothing you can do to change that. The only thing you can do is accept it and continue moving forward.""

It was then that it made the injured person on the dock begin to go through some kind of transformation. He grew longer limbs, his skin tore as his insides bloated and blades came out of his spine and other body parts. His eyes turned white and he began to salivate heavily as he stood up. (Think human to necromorph transformation)

I think I fell to my knees.

I don't remember what happened to the rest of us. Maybe the deity made us all transform into similar abominations as well. That or the monsters around us resumed their advance and killed us. Not sure what would have been the better option in this situation.

The thing is I had seen that exact afterlife in my previous dreams. I am quite sure about it although I can't remember the exact dream.

So last night I was dreaming being on a huge ship with almost everybody I knew or had seen during my life. I didn't realize this until close to dying. We were on some kind of parkour course and our job was to escape some other people who tried to get us. If we got caught, we would become the hunters and tried to catch the remaining runners. I escaped with my friends but then one of the hunters shoot me with a bow (which was maybe a fake one because it didn't hurt at all and I didn't die from it). After being caught I began catching the remaining runners with other hunters. I chased one runner very far and ended up in the control room of the ship. This was the moment I realized that this whole place was a ship. The ship began to bank and before I knew dark water was rushing inside. The ship sank very quickly, almost like the Titanic with one side pointing to the sky and one side sinking into the water. I fell down into the water with all the other people and it didn't take long for everyone to realize that we were not going to make it. I swam trying to keep my head up to breathe and find my family and friends so I could say goodbye. After a while I found my dad and my boyfriend, hugged them and tried to message them that I loved them because we all were completely under water at this point. I remember thinking ""I will see you in the afterlife."" My mother had already died because I saw a dress floating around that I knew belonged to her. I took the dress and squeezed it and the next thing I knew was that I felt really sleepy and I couldn't hold my breath any longer. I felt like I was falling, although there really wasn't anywhere to fall to.

Then I felt a thud and opened my eyes. I was on a beautiful field filled with flowers and heard laughter and speech. I got up and I was wearing my mother's dress. After looking around I realized that there was a huge lake and the field was next to it. On the other side of the lake there was this huge bright glow like the sun, but million times brighter. Then I saw cats. The cats were playing together in the field and some slept under trees. I really don't know how but I instantly knew these cats were people I had met during my time on the ship. Then I felt a tap on my shoulder and realized that one of my friends was here too, as a human. We said hello and walked together on the shore, where the waves from the wave hit our toes. There were a few cats drinking from the lake and I asked them what this place was. They just looked at me and then pointed to the lake. A huge creature rose from the water, I mean a HUGE creature. Somehow I still didn't feel scared. The creature didn't say a word but nodded and smiled (even though it did not have a face) when I asked is this the afterlife. Then I looked behind me and watched as the field, the trees and the whole place began to fill with more cats and humans. Then I woke up.

If you read this far, congratulations. I wonder if you dream about afterlife this vividly and if you do, do you see the same exact dream every time you dream about it?

Just recently I've started having these ""dreams"" like right as I'm falling asleep but not quite there yet.

Its so intense that its like i can even hear my ears making a flushing sound from the pressure like theyre about to explode. One thing that does match with the sleep paralysis is that once my body starts feeling tingly (that's how I know it's about to tense up) the more i cant move.

0,1175,Advice,2022-12-31 03:19:23,emdelgrosso,How do I handle my invasive neighbor?,"Context: 
My husband (M25) and I (F24) (no kids) moved into our first home in April 2022. (Southern USA)

The couple that lives on one side of us (“our neighbors”) is older and retired, has lived here for 2x longer than I’ve been alive, have 2 grown kids that have each moved to opposite sides of the country that they don’t see often, and they don’t have any commitments/hobbies other than the husband painting as far as I know. All this to say they have a lot of time and probably less social interaction than they need. 

Situation:
Our neighbors started out very kind, albeit with a much more intense level of involvement with us and our goings on than I had ever seen or experienced but know sometimes people have “nosy neighbors.” But I knew they were kind and well intentioned.

A little bit ago, my husband bumped into them out and about and ended up casually mentioning that I had a medical test coming up. This happening has ended up creating the most overwhelming, frustrating, taxing interpersonal situation I have dealt with in my entire adult life. I know that sounds dramatic. Keep reading.

Since that first test, unfortunately for me, the doctors have found more and more concerning things and have assigned me more and more tests. I have had at least one upcoming test at all times for months at this point, always being promised answers if we just do one more scan/test/procedure. Every single time one of these appointments is approaching, I get a text message from my neighbors telling me I’m being prayed for and asking if I need anything. Every single time one of these appointments pass, I get a call asking me how they’ve gone. 

This has been well intentioned of course, but feels invasive and adds to my overwhelm. 
But I’ve navigated it. Until today. 

I texted her today to let her know how today’s test went so that she didn’t blind-side me while I am in public tomorrow (and so that I could control the timeline, knowing she is going to ask me soon regardless). 
She calls. I let it go to voicemail (my throat hurts from my test today, talking makes it worse, and I am fully out of socializing today) and she texts me asking to call her when I can. I let her know I’m in pain and emotional and will call if I feel up to it and appreciate her caring. 

THEN! My doorbell rings. I’ve been recovering all day. I feel awful. I have been crying all day. I don’t want to socialize. It’s 9 p.m. 

I send my husband to go send her away. She insists she “just wants to hug, doesn’t have to talk.” He knows the shit storm he’d be in for if he made me talk to her, so he kindly said he’d pass on hugs and got her to leave, and then…

SHE. CALLS. MY. FATHER. 

Who I do not live with! 
She doesn’t know my dad knows anything about my medical things. 

This is so far beyond and past anything I am okay with. I feel totally violated. I feel frustrated. I should not have to carry this emotional burden of handling this. 

I can’t handle this the way I feel inclined to because I have to live next to them for an indeterminate amount of time. 

What do I do? What do I say? How do I handle this? Please give me any ideas at all. I’m at my wits end. 

I just want a friendly wave when we see each other outside. The occasional request to keep an eye out when either of us are out of town. A normal neighbor relationship. I’ve never done anything to allude I want anything more.",41,5,5,0.73,0,,/r/Advice/comments/zzjz8x/how_do_i_handle_my_invasive_neighbor/,False,True
1,1890,Advice,2021-01-19 10:06:47,bwssoldya,Struggling with selfishness versus being there for others,"Hey r/Advice,

I have been dealing with an internal struggle on and off for the past little while already and today it seems to have gotten to a point where I'm ready to ask some advice on the matter. It is the struggle between being a good friend and selfishness.

I have felt like a selfish person (in the bad way) for a while now, dealing with my problems, talking about myself a lot (this issue is here while writing this as well) and laying focus on myself. I've really taken notice of it this last year and I've decided I don't like being selfish. I want to be less selfish and focus more on the people around me. I want to hear them out, I want to help them with their struggles and I want them to be in a place where they enjoy being.

This however goes against the other side of me, the side of me that is hurting, that is in pain and that has helped me survive for the past like 5 years. I have no official diagnosis, but I'm pretty sure I am suffering of some form of depression, given how lazy I have gotten and how I beat myself up, both emotionally and in some ways physically as well (with junk food, taking care of my body etc).

Now that you know the two sides that are at play, I'd love like to explain the situation and go through some of the internal debate that rages within me. A good friend of mine is going through a tough spell in life. They have just broken up with their SO last week and yesterday they had some news that causes them to think their job might not be as secure as they had previously thought.

Over the course of this last week I've been talking to them about their breakup and I've kept on tell them I'm there for them and they need to reach out if they want my help and I've offered to hang out in voice chat with them when they're lonely in the mornings etc, been DMing with them on an almost daily basis to talk them through the rough patches and basically offering my support, trying to tell them everything will be alright and things will be better in the future. This has been going on for a week now and I totally get they are feeling down and in the dumps and life is taking a shit on them right now and I've been there and I know you have too.

However, since yesterday morning I've felt actually fairly happy since a while. Even though there's plenty of nasty dark clouds drifting over towards me as well, but I've not really had a break in the grey clouds that have been the day-to-day of my internal thoughts over the past 5 or so years, so to finally have a glimpse of a blue sky and some sunshine really gave me a good boost.

Today however, with my friend taking a few steps back down their emotional state where they were just last week as well, I am having a serious discussion on both sides of my being. On the one hand I want to be a good friend for them and be there for them,  I want to offer my support to them, I want to reach out to them and do .... I don't actually know what to do, I have no idea what to say or do to help them out, I know the feeling is shit and I've not really conquered it myself, so I don't know what other advice I can give besides ""hey things will be alright"". But I want to be there for them, I want them to not feel as shit as I have, or maybe improve it somehow. On the other hand, that would probably require more voice chat's as well, but I personally don't really enjoy the voice chats that much and on top of that, I'm feeling fairly alright today and yesterday and I don't want to go back to that place myself either, it's been a while since I left that place.

The thing is, this friend hasn't reached out to me today and from where I'm standing, I don't think it likely they will. They haven't asked me to hop into voice, they haven't asked me to DM them asking them to go into more detail on what they are feeling and they haven't asked for my support and part of me is going ""I really don't want to reach out to them again. It's all I've done for the past week or so and I've set aside my dislike for voice chats etc. to be there for them, I've offered to watch their favorite TV show with them, etc., all for them. I myself am feeling quite alright generally speaking and I don't want their 'negativity' (big word, I know they can't help it, but at the end of the day it is negativity) to ruin my day too. My past years have been bad enough by themselves. Let them reach out to me and maybe I'll consider responding, but maybe also not because of the last reason"".

On the other side however, I have this part of me going ""Dude. You offered to be their friend, you have on multiple occasions told them you want to be there for them and you want to help them. You have also decided that you want to try to not be as selfish as you have been and still are and it takes a lot of effort to be selfless, but c'mon, you made promises and you genuinely also want to be there for this person and you can't even be selfless for that. How can you call yourself a good friend if you can't even put your own feelings aside for a friend going through a deep deep valley in their life?""

Which gets answered with a ""yeah, and where was this friend when I was going through these deep valleys huh? Where were they for me?"", which sounds an awful lot like Ego, I do realize that.

To which the other side responds with ""What don't you understand about being selfless? The whole point is that you do it and not expect anything in return. Just because they weren't there for you doesn't mean you can't be there for them. Also you didn't reach out to them either, much like they are not reaching out to you right now and you know how shitty you felt. Maybe instead of letting them go through the same thing you went through you can reach out and they'll have a much easier time than you still have"".

**Question**  
So here finally I have the question for all of you: How do you deal with this sort of internal struggle? How do I make the right choice? Both for my friend and for me if at all possible? This struggle between selfishness (and Ego is on that team here and there as well) and between caring for others is a tough one and I don't know how to make this call, I need some help and I could ask my mother, but it feels like she is biased and I won't be getting the answer on *how* to deal with this and more on what to do in the situation, which doesn't help for any future similar situations.

Any advice or help would be much appreciated and even if you don't want to comment or plan to comment, thank you for reading through it all, it's been a long read and I appreciate it. I hope your day is going well and either way, I hope it only gets better for you.

2,1977,Advice,2022-08-29 21:47:02,introvertedfreak21,Best way to get rid of ants?,"So, I've had an issue with ants for a long time. I've tried thus shaker bag of ants killer and put around the outside of my house but they came back, I've kept a spray bottle of water, bleach, and peppermint to kill them when I see them in the house. I made sure there was no food left on dishes I put in the sink, and so on. Recently I noticed they came back and it's through a seal break on our back door. We rent so we can't really do anything and if we say we found the seal break because of ants, we are told bugs are our problems to deal with. I couldn't really figure out what they were after because they were in an area that we don't eat near and isn't close to the sink. Earlier today I decided to see how many packaged muffins we had left since we buy them in bulk. Come to find out, the ants were trying to get to the muffins. It seems the packaging was well sealed because they couldn't get through. They mostly wanted the chocolate muffin so I just took the few muffins we had out of the box, put them in a gallon ziploc bag, and threw the box away. I could see in the packaging that there were no ants in the food, just crawling on the plastic trying to get in. So, I've come to ask what others recommend. I can't afford the expense of calling an exterminator nor is the problem bad enough that I need one. Just a few ants get in but nothing too crazy and they are small black ants and we don't really get bit by them.",3,1,1,0.67,0,,/r/Advice/comments/x10wcg/best_way_to_get_rid_of_ants/,False,True
3,1989,Advice,2021-10-24 00:26:29,introvertedfreak21,Help cheering up a partner,"So, my boyfriend(25) and I(24f) have been together for almost five years. Even though we've had all this time together, I sometimes fill struggle to figure out how to cheer him up. One thing to consider is that he has very mild autism, its almost unnoticeable to most people. I only see small things with it, like a lack of empathy sometimes.

My problem I think lays mainly in helping make him feel better about himself. We come from very different backgrounds. I grew up poor, had two family vacations my whole life. My family scraped by with what they could and they never made it easy on themselves. They liked to drink and party like they were in their 20's and use their kids as therapists. I grew up in a very unstable home so any achievements I made, no matter the size, meant a lot to me. Buying my own car on an auto loan meant a lot even though it was totaled a year later. Moving out on my own meant alot, even if I had to have help to do it. Every little step meant something big to me.

My boyfriend is the opposite. His dad pretty much went to the military, worked on planes there, and once he was out, pretty much got a really good job. He wasn't set for life by any means. He had a wife with two kids not his own to take care and then his own kid as well. He had to not only work his job building planes, but a second one to keep up with the problems around his wife. Once she had passed away, his dad used that money form her death to just take the kids of a bunch of vacations. He didn't want to think of his grief, he didn't want his kids sad. I understand the sentiment but at the end of the day, I feel he should've given his children time to process their grief and have them a stable environment.  My boyfriend had been on more vacations than just the ones right after his mom's passing. He was only 14 at the time, once his dad moved on and met another woman who also had a good income, they took a lot of vacations and usually brought their families with them. 

But besides the vacations, Ben's dad never really pushed him much in school to do well. Always told him that to just go into the military and they will set you up for life. He has great ASVAB scores but because of his autism, he refused to see the military as his family. They couldn't break him like other soliders but also he had a hole in his heart they worried about. He finished basically training but they just discharged him. He hurt a lot after that, he felt like such a let down and couldn't believe he failed. Next he went and tried going to school to become a jet mechanic like his dad, even got a huge loan on his head just in hopes that would pan out. He did great in the classes, always good scores. But when it came to the final tests, he couldn't pass them. Not all his fault, a part of the test was not taught to him which was wielding metal together. After spending too much many and failing too many times, he gave up on that path and once again, felt like a failure. Nowadays, he can't seem to shake that feeling. I've tried my best to make him feel better but I just don't know how. I've slowly been working on his issues form the problems his family caused, like getting him use to being touched, pointing out stuff he shouldn't bring up around others, and helping him show its safe to come to me when he feels down. I know it isn't easy, his family really didn't treat him with much love as a kid.

I mainly just want any advice on how to help show him he's not a failure, that he can accomplish things on his own and doesn't need to rely on others. He mainly worries about the student loan on his head as its about $29k left on it form the original $40k. I try to remind him of what things he has accomplished but they all seem like small stuff to him, like living on his own with me and my roommate. It also doesn't help that his dad makes it seem easy to just be successful and pressures him to do better as an adult. He also acts like that just because Ben is over 21, he should have his life figured out.

Any advice would be appreciated. I just love him so much and want him happy.",0,1,1,0.67,0,,/r/Advice/comments/qeh49r/help_cheering_up_a_partner/,False,True

5,1994,Advice,2021-08-12 23:28:25,introvertedfreak21,Struggles wirh finding a woman,"I'm a 24 year old bisexual female. I've been in a committed relationship with my 25 year old boyfriend for 5 years now. Since I grew up in the South where there isn't a large LGBT community, it was hard to find girls to date before I was with my boyfriend. He's very open minded and doesn't mind me trying to just find a woman to mess around with. I think part of it is because he wants me to get over my trust issues with women since I've had a lot of failed mother figures and terrible female friends.

For awhile, I gave up on trying to find a girl. This is because it was just hard. I'd match with a girl, we would chat for awhile and she would either just ghost me after a week or start making plans to meet and just never confirm a time and date. Recently, my best friend(25m) got a girlfriend who is also bisexual. She's really cool but he's made it pretty clear he is not open to her being with anyone but him. I respect that but it has made me want to try again because she is so very open about being bisexual and it was just such a breath of fresh air to me. I never realized how suffocating living in the south really is to me. I plan to move eventually.

Now my current issue. I made a tinder looking for only girls. I've managed to get a good few matches and I messaged most of them first. Only one responded back and she just stopped talking suddenly too. The others just don't respond. I guess I just get discouraged easily. I wanted maybe some tips or advice on how to handle this situation. Maybe there is a certain way I talk that turns them away, maybe they expect me to move faster than I actually do.

6,2000,Advice,2021-06-01 21:19:38,introvertedfreak21,Unsure on reconnecting with my older half-sister,"Hi, I'm a 23 female and this is gonna be kinda long.

Some back story first to get a full picture. My sister and I share a mom but not a dad and have a six year age gap. My parents split when I was 3 in an ugly divorce. My dad choose to try and be a part of my life still and I think my sister resented that because her dad just left. My dad tried his best to also be a father to her, he did help raise her with my mom before the divorce but she didn't want him as a dad after the divorce. 

Up until I was 11, I lived with my mom and sister. Most of the memories are blurry to me as I was forced to take heavy medication for ADHD.  When I was 11, my dad got custody because my mother was a drug addict and would let my sister and I live in filth. It was bad, as in cat feces and empty pill bottles all over the floors, flea infested beds, I even found an old report card form my time there were I had missed 93 days of school. We lived in a house my grandfather owned, once he came to live with us, he helped get rid of most of the cats, cleaned the house up, and helped take care of my sister and I. Since she was so much older, when my sister was home, she would either take care of me or completely shut me out. Most times it was my grandfather but he had to work a lot and this was all because my mom would just sleep all day. My grandfather wasn't without his vices too but they were much more minor, just stuff like some pot or beer when he wasn't working. That was all just to give an idea of the kinda home I had then. 

When I was 13, my dad managed to ween me off the meds enough that the doctors said I could completely stop taking them, he let me make that choice and I stopped taking them, I couldn't stand them. They made me feel less me, like I was a watered down version of myself that could only really think all the time. Shortly after that, I remembered parts of how bad living with my mom was. I remembered how bad it was and living with my dad made me realize that wasn't normal. I thought that my mom needed help, a push to make herself better. So, I cut contact with her until she got sober. I kept in contact with my grandfather and sister for a few months after but seeing them just made the decision harder. They would talk about how good she was doing and that I should come see her, trying to make me feel guilty. More than anything, they blamed it all on my dad. I had to cut contact with them too.

When I was 15, almost 16, I decided to reach out to them again. It was because I wanted to know more about my mom and hope she was better. It was emotional to say the least. What I remember most was being able to tell who my sister and grandfather was but then seeing this woman behind my sister with dark hair and was very thin. I didn't realize who she was till she hugged me and cried about her baby. I didn't recognize my own mother. She went form being 300lbs to only 95lbs at 5'4"". She didn't look healthy, she scared me honestly. She looked like skin and bones. I know now that it was probably a combination of loose skin and drugs that made her that way. It wasn't a good idea to see them, I honestly regret it. They filled my head with these lies about my dad, tried to make me believe he was abusing me(I had bad ance that he would pop sometimes which hurt but it wasn't abuse) and just all these nasty things. My mom ended up calling child.protective services on my dad. After my dad got me back home, he talked to me about what happened and helped me see that my mom and sister just used me to hurt him again and what they said wasn't true. I decided to cut contact again after that happened.

A year passed and with it, so did my mom. She died of s drug overdose and that fact ripped me up inside. I believed so heavily that one day she would overcome her addiction so we could have a healthy relationship, I really wanted to believe she loved me more than drugs so to die in such a manner hurt. I remember the morning my dad told me, he work me up after my stepsister left for school, made my favorite breakfast sandwich and sat at the table. As soon as he told me, I just broke down in tears. I still tear up thinking about it. He let me stay home from school so I could process my feelings. That Saturday, we went to see my sister and grandfather to mourn with them. I wanted to see my uncle too but he was inside so I left my dad's side to go see my uncle. I talk to him when my sister came in the room. I gave him a hug and my sister joined the hug. Then she whispered in my ear how my mom couldn't live without her baby. She put the thought in my head that my mom's death might not have been an accident. I ran back to my dad crying, told him what my sister said and we went home after that. We went to the funeral, sitting away from my sister and grandfather while it happened. I cried the whole funeral, it was just hard to accept she was gone and I struggled for years on how to accept her death and how she died. I eventually accepted that her death was an accident and that there was no deeper meaning behind it. My sister blamed my dad for her death and why I didn't talk to her anymore. She would every now and again send me a message on facebook about her missing me and how my dad was keeping us apart like he controlled me.

My dad is no saint though. He was a great dad for most of my life but in the end, he made mistakes too. I felt more like just a tool while living with him and my step mom. She treated me like a second-class person, like I was below her and convinced my dad that I was mean to her for no reason. He always promised to leave her but never did. For a year he had a lot of seizures that was linked to a clogged artery that really affected how he thinks and acts now. Its probably best he was with her for that because she has a lot of experience with seizures and does her best to take care of him. I don't like her still but as an adult, we get along. She stopped trying to be a mom to me and has just become my dad's wife.

Now to today. I never had the real strong urge to reach out to my sister. She seemed to being going down the same path our mom took, doing drugs, dropped out of school, never got a job, and just lived off the money the government would give her and my grandfather for the three kids she had with her drug dealer boyfriend. Maybe I'm really just looking for validation on keeping things the way they are. I briefly felt like maybe reaching out wouldn't be bad if I set firm boundaries with her and just finally get more information about my mom. I always felt like part of me was missing, I never really knew my mom at all and only got bits and pieces about who she was form my dad. She was already lost to drugs by the time I could remember anything about her. I am just unsure if I should reach out to her, if I really need that kind of trouble in my life. Keeping out of contact would change nothing about my life as it is and I'm content with where I am as a person but reaching out feels like it might just cause more problems in the long run and add really nothing to my life as is. I might also just be looking for a support system in the wrong way, its hard to live life when the people you expect to support you have failed you a lot as well. Honestly, I only really have three people I feel won't ever hurt me or just leave me. So, any advice would be helpful, I might just choose to keep out of contact because it just feels like the best option since she seems so convinced that my dad is to blame and may be beyond reasoning out of that.",0,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/Advice/comments/nq4xct/unsure_on_reconnecting_with_my_older_halfsister/,False,True
7,2001,Advice,2021-05-29 23:49:07,introvertedfreak21,Advice on becoming normal after leaving an adusive home,"This one will probably be really long as there is a lot to unpack. I am a 23 female.

To start, I moved out of my dad and step mom's home in December 2020. I couldn't be happier, this has been one of the best things for my mental health but I am struggling with it at the same time.

It really never hit me how bad my home life was until I got into a healthy relationship with my bf, he has been very supportive and helped me a lot when things with my family was bad. I would like to say it wasn't always bad, it was mainly just my step mom and I butting heads a lot because she couldn't understand why I wouldn't want to be more girly and blamed every issue I had on ADHD and always comparing me to my little sister, her daughter form a previous marriage. I had a good relationship with my dad and stepsister, it was mainly just my step mom I had issues with but it wasn't bad until we moved form our family home in a quiet neighborhood to this home far form the city with lots of land.

After the move, things didn't go well. My parents went into a bunch of debt to get that home and get it the way they wanted. That seemed fine because my dad had a job he was making decent money at but it wasn't a stable enough job, it was all contract work for putting appliances in people's homes. Things weren't good between my dad and his boss so he tried going solo. The money issues piled up, dad wasn't making a lot of money and my stepmom's job was only making sure ends meet, debts weren't getting paid. There were times I had to pay our electric bill because someone showed up to shut it off while I was home alone form work.

They charged me crazy high for rent in a home with three adults and one minor(my sister was in highschool most of this time up until May of last year). It went form 300 to 400 to 600 for my bedroom. I also had to pay my own car insurance and all issues that arose with that car. It wasn't easy, I could never save money because I couldn't stand being there. I would make sure to be gone every minute my parents were awake. Leave two hours before my shift just so I could be gone, hang out at my bf's after work just to stay gone, be at his house all weekend long. Just. To. Be. Gone. I couldn't take it because almost every night someone was drunk or high and the other was screaming. Some nights I'd come home from a 12hr shift at work only for them to have all their friends over to be loud and drunk by the pool. It was like living with bad college roommates and I was the only adult. 

I hated the holidays because of them. I remember Christmas being the worst. One christmas my dad threatened to not give my sister and I anything at all because we whined a little about some christmas photos. Even though stepmom made us stand outside in cold weather in Christmas dresses. We did it, we did our best to pose but we whined a little because we were cold. We were also 21 and 16. Another Christmas was ruined because my dad mixed alcohol and Xannax together. Most know not to do this, we told him several times that he becomes so ugly to us when he does. He did it anyways, yelled and screamed at us about not caring about him and demanded that I, his own daughter, go get his gun and let him shoot himself in the head. He eventually went outside to sit in his truck because we wouldn't listen to him, my step mom had to fight him to get his pistol away because we honestly didn't want him dead. We were so thankful the neighbors didn't call the cops form their screaming. I remember at one point hiding myself and my sister in my room form my father as he and step mom screamed at each other that night. Once he left for his truck, we were able to try and do Christmas Eve stuff together and he eventually came back inside and apologized for being ugly. That was the last Christmas Ever I spent with them, I made sure to get out before the next one.

Now, the part I need advice on as that was all to get an idea of where my problems come from.

I currently live with my bf and our mutual male best friend, Ron. Bf and I both come from small families, him being the baby. Ron however comes from a happy split family. His dad has two other sons and three stepkids, all get along well. His mom had two more kids as well. Ron is the oldest of 7 kids so he is use to always having someone around and people to mess with. I'm not use to it, every now and again I catch myself reacting to Ron or BF just walking by, making a noise, things like that. I'm so use to reacting in fear, preparing myself for a fight because my dad or step mom is home and drunk. I'm struggling to let my guard down I guess. Mainly just with Ron because he will just come by and touch me, just walk past me to get to the fridge, or make noises to mimic a show I'm watching. Its all harmless stuff and I know but I'm just so use to being combative that I have to keep catching myself from starting a fight needlessly. I know he means nothing by it, I know he's just use to having lots of siblings to pick on around so going form households of at least 5 people at a time to just a small place of three people is hard. I just need advice on how to let my guard down and stop seeing every thing as a need to protect myself.",3,2,2,1.0,0,,/r/Advice/comments/nnz5qw/advice_on_becoming_normal_after_leaving_an/,False,True

I pass on things I need to help others and I think I've set a bad precedence because now there's no prio for gear. I'm watching teammates gear multiple characters and I'm struggling with my main.

I had to be flexible and change my spec and relearn a totally new one for the good of the team. I was told that I'd be prio'ed for gear and anyway, no one else really needed gear anymore anyway. So basically I'm getting the scraps.

So my leader keeps telling me I need to upgrade my gear. The problem is that the gear I need isn't dropping and when it does other people are needing it as well. Tonight an alt character got the gear my lead keeps telling me to get! Then they ended up trading it to another player. I swear it's a ""good 'ol boy system"" at play.

I want to leave but I have a bunch of people I'm attached to within the group that are not at fault as well as family and IRL friends that play. If I leave it will create a mess for them but I'm doubtful anything will change if I stay. I don't want to be seen as throwing a tantrum to try to get my way.

17,219,Advice,2023-05-27 10:40:53,throwraFrequentRow2,How do I move on from something like this?,"Was I potentially dealing with a narcissist?


In 2021 I was in a position financially, emotionally to be ready for a relationship 

I’d never had a boyfriend because for some reason I never felt attracted to anyone. Like kissing made me feel weird 

And I met a man who had just weeks ago immigrated to this country and had downloaded tinder.

We talked for just over a month until I was so ready to meet him. He was putting it off, I think cause he had just moved here and was unsettled. But he seemed keen, constantly texting me with updates about his day etc 

So I set up the first date. I was on a camping trip with friends which happened to be down the road from his house, so one evening I popped out to meet him. We had a great time, instant chemistry and amazing chats. He texted me how much he fancied me and couldn’t wait to see me again

For the first time in my life, I loved our kissing. They were passionate and intense chemistry, and I enjoyed sex for the first time too. I thought I’d finally met my person. I was always turned on around him and I was the one always initiating sex 

And from that point, we were dating. I had to plan all the dates as I was the one with the car. I would pick him up and we would go hang out somewhere outdoors.

The chats we had were amazing. Shared experiences of grief and interest in music. We would lay in the park and talk forever. He was kind and sensitive and reassured me he was a nice guy as I was cautious and apprehensive with dating. He told me all his exes still want to be friends with him as they know he’s nice and harmless.

I liked the pace of the relationship too, quick to become comfortable but not rushing things. He seemed very into me, soppy messages, loads of compliments and talks of the future. I felt safe and comfortable.I’ve never had a man I like, be interested back too so my feelings were amazing 

At 3 months, I moved closer to his town, not just to be closer to him but to be closer to my work too. 

It was at that point, my housemates pointed out I was doing s lot for him and he didn’t take me on dates. I cooked him dinners and planned fun things. I was supportive to help him find a new job etc . When he was sick, I was out getting him meds and stuff for his back ache. I felt like the adult in the relationship 

I brought up the lack of dates one day. I told him ‘I feel I do a lot when it comes to planning dates. I would really like it if you took the initiative to plan things. It doesn’t need to be expensive or even cost anything.’ He came up with some weird excuses like I was better at planning bla bla bla. Even on my birthday there was no effort 

But from that point, I felt a massive change in him. He was no longer super kind and friendly to me. He gave me very dirty evil looks and little criticisms all the time. When I brought up further needs, again in a sensitive way, I was told I was pressuring and manipulative. He talked about his ex girlfriends non stop. 

His attitude toward me got worse, he seemed so annoyed by everything. Even accusing me of being bad at planning and unable to understand sarcasm. He never even made an effort to get me food and drink when I stayed at his, I would have to make sure to bring my own food so I didn’t get hungry. Even him getting me a glass of water always seemed a big annoying effort for him

At the same time I was going through a hard time with loss of my job, some awful housemates, family illness and grief from loss of a family member 

He dumped me and told me he dated me because he was lonely and never fe in love

He never even spoke to me like he did with his exes, which hurts and makes me wonder what’s wrong with me",4,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/Advice/comments/13t4321/how_do_i_move_on_from_something_like_this/,False,False

I call the number for Accounts Payable that they put on the letter about 10 different times, and each time the person on the line did not understand my issue, they seem Just as confused as I am.

I was even given 2 other numbers from them that directed me to billing, and they did not understand my problem either.

I ALMOST got it and then they sent me another email shortly after saying that my check's funds were deposited, which is not true. There was no pending funds or deposited funds anytime for that amount in the month of April on my bank statements.

It has been over a month and I am sick of jumping through hoops for what should have been a simple fix, and I know $30.00 is not a lot to some people but that could really help me out.

For more background information, I have been with this provider since 2020 and my parents also received a check from them last month, only there's DID go through, so I highly doubt this is a scam, just seems very fishy to me and I don't know how to proceed.

21,223,Advice,2023-05-27 10:32:05,Sho_up,Should I break up with my boyfriend?,"So long story here. Buckle up. (I shall use fake names for this story) 

Logan and I (Sara) have been together for 4 years this December. Met when we were 18 on tinder and clicked and have been together ever since. We will be turning 22 this year. I am 3 months older September 2001 and he’s December 2001. We have similar interests and we like spending time together, we’re close and he’s my best friend. Honestly we’ve raised each other and part of me can’t imagine my life without him. We’ve been living together for just over 2 years and have lived with his parents, on our own and then with my younger sister. 

We’ve been through so much together, his parents (very toxic) and their treatment of me, which we’ve sorted but still is kinda painful, my mums death (she was a narcissist but I’m her oldest daughter and we were still quite close), my struggles with obesity and PCOS/endometriosis, his poor mental health and undiagnosed depression, financial hardship, Covid 19 and the Aus NSW lockdowns, my complicated relationship with my father and younger brother and so much more. 

Although the main reasons I’m thinking about leaving him are as follows. 

1. Tonight he got upset and overwhelmed and punched a hole in our garage door, this isn’t the first time he’s done something like this. Once he was so angry he threw a McFlurry at the ground and screamed, he broke his hand in 2 places in early 2021 from punching a floor. He knows this behaviour triggers me as my boyfriend before him threw a brick through my window and constantly screamed at me for the little things which has caused me some trauma. I’ve attempted to communicate with him multiple times and he acknowledges every-time, this happens usually once or twice a year, although the arguments and screaming has picked up over the last 3-4 months. 

2. I’m not feeling very sexually satisfied. We have our once a week and it’s usually hand stuff which is okay but I’ve expressed an interest into other things and a different frequency and I’m denied or we agree and then it’s the same stuff every-time. Consent is important and I do respect his boundaries but even then he finishes and it takes me ages to because I’m not 100% enjoying myself. 

3. We have been together 3.5 years and not once has this man cooked me a meal, yes he’s made me toast and noodles, and grabbed the Uber eats from the door, but he’s never made me a meal because “my cooking tastes better”. We’ve talked about weaponised incompetence he is quite intelligent and knows how to make meals, and he says he will try harder and hasn’t.

4. Also not once has he planned a date, he’s paid for quite a few but never called to book a table or surprise me with something special I’ve booked and organised every single one in all 3.5 years. He also hasn’t bothered to get his licence so I do ferry him around quite a bit (contributes to gas and rego) and even though again I have tried to communicate with him about these issues I am met with “I will try harder” and “I don’t want to get my licence” “I don’t like driving” etc, even though our lives with benefit greatly from him driving, taking himself places, going to his own appointments etc. 

5. Final main point is I basically mange his life. I have a genuine belief that if I don’t run his errands for him he wouldn’t do it. He is listed as a dependent under me on his doctors forms because he doesn’t want his own account, I have to remind him to call his grandparents, I go out and get him new socks when his got lost or have holes, sew the holes in his pants, remind him to pack lunch and take house eyes etc and drop off lunch/house keys when he does forget. it makes me feel like his mum which I hate. I have mentioned little things here and there regarding this specific issue but we haven’t had a massive conversation. 

I would like to add to some of the positives as I feel like so far I’ve only focused on the negatives. 

He is incredibly funny and intelligent, in my eyes physically he is beautiful, flawed like every human but somehow I feel I can look past almost anything he does and be okay. When I see him I see home, comfort and fun. He is generous, has great friends and people skills, he usually shower with me. Washes my hair and face, cuddles me when I need, strokes my hair. He smells great even when he doesn’t and we have a 2 thirds 1 third on the finance split in our house. Logan works a full time job and I have a permanent part time job and study. He washes clothes for me and takes on and puts on my shoes for me when I get home/leave for work. 

I guess my main issue is am I staying with him because I’m comfortable or am I genuinely willing to look past these rough times and move on with him? I can see us getting married (although I’m not sure how he feels about commitment) and having children, I can see him being a great dad.

My mom passed away a few years ago but had an agreement with her job through her insurance to gift a family member a certain amount of money for life every month after she passes away. I have a small family with just my sister, dad and me. So my mom near the end of her life decided to give my sister the amount of $500 bc it was the most amount she qualified for. (I would of gotten $350.) My sister who is 8 years older, also bought her first home before that time and is renting it out with a slight profit. My mom also thought my sister would use the extra $500 for life for helping pay the mortgage of the Maple house, as we call it. The one thing my mom left me was a stock account worth $5000. My mom loved us very much equally. We never had the conversation about the fairness of the distribution of money. Well it’s been about 2 years since my mom passed and my sister has been receiving a free $500 every month since she passed, for the rest of her life. If you do the math, in 40 years it will be close to $240,000 she would of gotten for free. 
Well my dad’s health is declining and we are setting up a trust. We are having a discussion, and we talked about making things 50/50 between us so there is no bad blood with money between us. She has a house with her husband and the other home she rents out. I told her how I felt it’s unfair that she is getting all this money and if it was are gonna be 50/50 from the parents then shouldn’t that be apart of that too? 
After many discussions, she agreed it’s better to pay half than have bad blood between us. I told her that if things were reversed and I got the gift of $350, I would’ve shared 50/50 with her. We are the only family we have, and we should share things equally for when my dad passes away.

Do you think it’s wrong for me to think we should share this $500 for life? Or is that fair to be equals with everything?",0,1,1,1.0,0,,/r/Advice/comments/13t3wfn/siblings_money_problem_advice/,False,False

my problem: now i have terrible anxiety that it’s going to happen to my dog. about 2-3 times a week, an hour after he eats, i get incredibly fucking anxious and start feeling my dog’s stomach, making sure it’s not hard and large. even though it’s not, i convince myself it feels harder/larger than usual and send myself into a panic attack thinking that he’s going to die - my dog is my life, and losing him like i lost my family dog so suddenly keeps me up at night. sometimes i also get anxious with just normal things.

In the past few weeks (to be honest, since this new lady helper started working) he’s been written up twice and he gets kicked out the next time. Why? Because he tries to play with the anti-social dogs cowering in the corner. 

I asked more questions because at first I figured he wasn’t reading social cues and was an overbearing puppy (aka truly his fault). But no, he listens just fine and typically moves on to another dog who wants to play. 

The two times he got written up only a few dogs were there (not his usual buddies) and he had no playmates so he kept trying to get them to play. They admitted absolutely no aggression or dominance was seen, he was just an annoyance to the other anti-social dogs and they’ll bite eventually (and it’ll be his fault). 

I’m super confused. The other people who work at the daycare love him and say he’s an angel and actually get even get the shyest dogs more confident and willing to engage. Either way, shouldn’t the anti-social dogs be either kicked out of daycare or at least grouped together with other less playful dogs? I can’t imagine putting my dog in daycare if he hated it. 

If he does get kicked out, I plan to ask them to review who wrote him each time as she has always rubbed me the wrong way. This is the best rated local daycare so he’ll just be stuck at home otherwise. I don’t trust these other ones.",12,3,3,0.81,0,,/r/dogs/comments/us4vjh/am_i_wrong/,False,True

When the rescue found her, she was extremely malnourished, had a bad case of mange, and 5 puppies in the FL wilderness. It was summer during FLs 4ish months of daily thunder storms. To non natives, the storms tend to be brief, but bring lots of thunder, lightening, and heavy rain.

When I first rescued her she would tremble during storms. She was very submissive and skittish. We spent some time helping her conquer her fears and by the end of the season, the trembling stopped and she would go to her crate or cuddle during storms.

Jump to now after a 7 month drought and the trembling is back, but it is worse and she now hyperventilates. She stares at the ceiling like it will come down. The storms could be miles off and not even have lightening and she still breaks down. It's to the point where I wake up to her trembling in the night and have to strain to hear far off thunder. She seems to be getting worse with every strom.

Nothing helps...we have tried sprays, neck pillows, jackets and not even the slightest improvement. I have a co pletely blacked out room where lightening can't be seen and it doesn't matter. The best we can do is hold all 50lbs of her, but it doesn't help. Tonight I am cutting up an old sweater for her to wear every night so she gets used to wearing something to see if that makes her more secure (thunder vest are crazy expensive so I'm making my own unless it helps). 

Has anyone dealt with something like this and been able to help? It breaks my heart to watch her suffer and there are 4 months of daily storms every year. That's a long time to suffer. The vet offered meds, but I hate to do that to her unless there is truly no other option.

Before I brought her home, she had already been through a lot (found in the woods extremely malnourished with puppies, mange, and heartworms). She had definitely lived with someone before because she was completely house and kennel trained. For the most part, it has been fairly easy to break her bad habits and she is the perfect dog. I still need to socialize her more when the heartworms are gone, but she is not as skittish as when I got her. 

My big concern is she is terrified of thunder and lightening. I assume she lived in the woods and had a bad experience. Problem is, I live in Florida; there is thunder and lightening pretty much everyday in the summer. Every storm she trembles and goes to the bed or crate. She won't respond to commands or even take treats. So far I have been comforting her when she gets really bad, but is home alone in the crate for 4-5 hours 5 days a week.

Around a month or so after moving with us, she started doing systematic attacks on friends when they came over. She would lunge, bark, whine, and bump her nose on their face, as if she was going to bite, but she never did bite anyone, thought it was super scary. She's a medium-big dog (22kg). Long story short, we worked with a trainer (she's our first dog), made her a safe space in the house (crate and bed), and learned to recognize her triggers, so we haven't had an incident in a while. 

One of her triggers is being pet. We are very strict with visitors that they shouldn't touch her, even though she will often rest her chin on their knees. Her attacks were always unpredictable, she doesn't growl before doing it and she will go from looking calm to suddenly attacking the visitor. 

All good now, and we have a super life all together and a lot of fun. However, we have noticed that when she's resting at home and we talk to her and praise her, she wags her tail, but when we start petting her, she suddenly stops. Are we reading her right? She doesn't like us, her humans, to pet her? Is that a thing? We're okay with respecting her boundaries even with us, but I am wondering if this is normal. She is rarely affectionate, for example sitting close to us on the couch, or looking happy to receive belly scratches.

And he left maybe a third of his food untouched. While I'm staring he just sniffs it a bit, then turns away. A few times.

I try watering it a bit more - cause I dunno what to do. But still the waiting and some growling. There's even a few pieces of food on the floor, which they usually eat up real quick.

It would be like this (on a work day) : wake up 7/8am, walk, work, home for lunch break, dog Walker, home, walk, dinner, bed 10/11pm. Then me and my partner went on holiday for 3 weeks and his mother came to stay at ours to look after our 2 dogs, Lola and Louis. Her favourite dog is Louis and boy does she let that be known, she ignores Lola and says how much she loves Louis and hugs him. In the past, she’s made Louis physically sick by giving him food that I’ve told her not to when she’s looked after him, eg cake and fast food! Anyway, so I made some rules: please stick to the same routine as much as possible, don’t feed them junk, don’t walk them excessively (she’s unemployed so she will take them none stop). So when we get back from our holidays, we’ve found out what the dogs new routine looks like: wake up at 4/5am (because that’s what time they wake her up and she happily gets up and gives them what they want instead of going back to sleep), walk all day, eat leftovers, bed. 
So now we’re back and MIL has left, Louis is miserable! He can’t believe we are doing this to him, only 3x1 hour walks a day and left 8 hours alone?! How can we do such a thing! To make things worse, I’ve got the flu since coming home so he can see I’m home but I’m just lying in bed, too Ill to take him out and he’s besides himself. Lola doesn’t care much as she is a foodie and doesn’t care about walks and MIL didn’t take her out all day unlike with Louis because she’s too strong (ridgeback). 
So now I feel the guilt and anxiety from Louis, he’s sitting at the front door constantly thinking we’re taking him out, he’s started to howl, he’s not sleeping with us at night, as soon as we get ready for work he’s excited thinking he’s going out (even though we’ve just taken him out for 45mins/1hour) and he wakes us up at stupid times 4/5am! I wish I could say to him “I’m sorry, we have to go to work to make money so you can eat and have toys” or say “I’m sorry, I’m sick, I can’t get up today, please play in the garden with Lola” and instead he stares miserably into the Abyss waiting for MIL to return and give him the life all dog owners want to give.
